<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, Test-time adaptation, Distribution estimation, Bayes' theorem, Catastrophic forgetting

Summary: 
Distributional Test-time Adaptation (DOTA) is proposed to address the limitations of existing cache-based test-time adapters for vision-language models like CLIP. DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of test data and computes test-time posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach allows the model to adapt to deployment environments and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. DOTA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of DOTA in improving reliability and reducing the cost associated with fine-tuning VLMs. Overall, DOTA offers a simple yet effective solution for enhancing the performance and adaptability of vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

<div> Keywords: routing, multigraphs, graph neural network, multi-objective, autoregressive

Summary:
Two graph neural network-based methods are proposed to tackle multi-objective routing on multigraphs. The first approach involves autoregressively selecting edges in the multigraph until a tour is completed. The second model simplifies the multigraph through a learned pruning strategy before performing autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. Both models are evaluated empirically across various problems and graph distributions, showing competitive performance against strong heuristics and neural baselines. This research addresses the existing gap in routing methods for multigraphs and showcases the effectiveness of graph neural networks in solving multi-objective routing problems. <div>

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.

<div> graph neural networks, intrusion detection, self-supervised, masked autoencoder, transformer-based encoder-decoder <br />
Summary: <br />
GraphIDS is a novel self-supervised intrusion detection model that combines representation learning and anomaly detection for network traffic. By using a masked autoencoder to learn local graph representations of normal communication patterns, GraphIDS captures typical network behavior. The model utilizes an inductive graph neural network to embed each flow with its local topological context and a Transformer-based encoder-decoder to reconstruct these embeddings, learning global co-occurrence patterns through self-attention. During inference, flows with high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework optimizes embeddings for the downstream task, enhancing the identification of malicious traffic. GraphIDS outperforms baselines on diverse NetFlow benchmarks, achieving impressive PR-AUC and macro F1-score results. <div>

Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

Summary:
The article introduces the Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model as a solution for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. It addresses the limitations of Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons by incorporating a multi-dendritic and soma architecture inspired by biological neurons.

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.

Abstract: Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems.
  We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

Summary:
This paper presents a new method for analyzing food retail processes to reduce food waste. The approach combines object-centric process mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. Initially, a continuous-time Markov chain is derived from sales data to model customer behavior. This model is then expanded to incorporate supply activities, creating a comprehensive view of the entire process. By conducting what-if analyses, the optimal balance between customer demand and supply strategies can be determined. This helps in preventing food waste resulting from oversupply as well as avoiding product shortages. The integration of OCPM and stochastic processes provides a unique approach to addressing food waste issues in the retail sector. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and product shortages.

Summary: 
Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach to solving PDEs, but are sensitive to loss weight selection. The study proposes two-dimensional analysis-based weighting schemes, one relying on quantifiable terms and another incorporating unquantifiable terms for balanced training. Benchmark tests on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid-driven cavity flows demonstrate the superiority of the second scheme in enhancing stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Particularly in high Peclet number convection diffusion scenarios, where traditional solvers struggle, PINNs utilizing the new weighting scheme exhibit stable and precise predictions, underscoring their robustness and versatility in solving CFD problems. <br /> <br /> <div>

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD problems.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as agents for experimental design, but a study found that they lack sensitivity to experimental feedback. The study evaluated open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs in genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks, finding that LLM-based agents did not improve performance when true outcomes were replaced with random labels. Classical methods like linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently outperformed LLM agents. A hybrid method, LLMNN, combining LLM knowledge with nearest-neighbor sampling, achieved competitive or superior results across domains without needing significant adaptation. The study suggests that current LLMs struggle with in-context experimental design, highlighting the importance of hybrid frameworks that separate prior-based reasoning from acquiring updated posteriors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Summary:
NUFILT proposes a data-free framework for continual model merging, focusing on transparency and fidelity. By leveraging task vectors aligned with representation subspaces, NUFILT ensures transparency by filtering out overlapping components of new tasks and maintains fidelity by using a lightweight LoRA adapter to inject task-specific signals. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain consistency while introducing novel directions. The backbone can absorb new knowledge while preserving existing behaviors, and updates are fused back in a layer-wise linear fashion without additional parameters or inference cost. Theoretical guarantees for approximate subspace alignment justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT outperforms existing approaches on vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving minimal forgetting, narrowing the gap with fine-tuning, and reducing computation overhead. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost. Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks, improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Summary: This work addresses the challenge of interpreting black box models used in low-resource tabular problems by proposing the use of reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees. By leveraging prior knowledge and learning from data, these LLMs create lightweight decision trees that outperform traditional CART models. While not matching the performance of black box models, decision trees offer a human-readable reasoning trace that can be analyzed for biases and data leaks. The creation process allows for additional human input, enabling corrections of biases and incorporation of domain-specific intuition not captured in the data. This approach provides a promising alternative for improving interpretability and incorporating expert knowledge in model development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data.

<br />
Summary: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new type of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. While IGNs support single and multi-step generation, conventional models can suffer from training instabilities and mode collapse. In contrast, diffusion and score-based models offer stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality but come with a high computational cost. The proposed method, SIGN, distills idempotent models from pre-trained diffusion model scores, providing a stable and efficient alternative to iterative generation models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, with the ability to project alternate distributions back onto the target manifold for zero-shot editing. Empirical validation on image datasets shows SIGNs achieve state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on CIFAR and CelebA datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Summary: 
Hallucinations in generative models are formalized as failures to connect an estimate to a plausible cause, leading to estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Even optimal estimators that minimize loss still exhibit hallucinations. A general high probability lower bound exists on the rate of hallucinations for generic data distributions. This reframing of hallucinations highlights a structural misalignment between loss minimization and outputs deemed acceptable by humans. Experimental results on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image tasks support the theoretical framework presented. <div>

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).

Summary:
A new high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark, KD48, has been developed to address the challenge of reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics from incomplete surface observations. The benchmark is curated with expert-driven denoising and serves as a standardized, analysis-ready benchmark for Earth science research. A novel reconstruction paradigm, VISION, based on Dynamic Prompting has been introduced to tackle missing data in real-world observations. VISION generates visual prompts on-the-fly from available observations to guide adaptive adjustment strategies in a universal backbone model. The State-conditioned Prompting module efficiently injects prompts, enabling VISION to handle challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark show that VISION outperforms existing models and exhibits strong generalization in extreme data missing scenarios. The work provides a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields, from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty.

Summary: 
The paper introduces conformal data augmentation as a method to generate diverse synthetic data while controlling bias. This framework leverages conformal prediction to filter out poor-quality generations, ensuring provable risk control without requiring access to model logits or extensive retraining. The approach is demonstrated to be effective in various tasks including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection. Results show consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score compared to unaugmented baselines and 4% over other filtered augmentation methods. <div>
arXiv:2509.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications, synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on distributed learning in the context of gradient-free zero-order optimization, presenting FedZero as a federated zero-order algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees. FedZero achieves near-optimal error bounds with high probability in the federated convex setting and introduces high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization in the single-worker regime. The algorithm utilizes a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere. New concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere with explicit constants are developed to analyze FedZero. These concentration tools are crucial for the high-probability guarantees and have potential independent applications. <div>

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere. To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

<div> Fourier neural operators, reservoir systems, subsurface fluid flow, neural operator architecture, computational experiments<br />
<br />Summary: This paper introduces a neural operator architecture, TFNO-opt, for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems. Traditional numerical methods for such systems are time-consuming, limiting their applicability in control and decision support. The TFNO-opt architecture utilizes Fourier neural operators to approximate solutions in functional spaces, improving accuracy and stability for control problems. Modifications such as adjustable time resolution, tensor decomposition, and error function enhancements enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. Computational experiments show a six-order-of-magnitude acceleration compared to traditional methods in hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage problem. This advancement opens new opportunities for effectively controlling complex reservoir systems. <div>
arXiv:2509.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.

<div> GraphPFN, node-level prediction, prior-data fitted network, synthetic attributed graphs, tabular foundation model <br />
Summary: 
GraphPFN is a novel approach for node-level prediction on graph data, utilizing a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs generated using stochastic block models and preferential attachment processes. By incorporating graph-aware structured causal models and training on synthetic graphs sampled from the prior, the model, based on LimiX, captures complex graph structural dependencies. It outperforms existing models like G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs on real-world datasets of up to 50,000 nodes after fine-tuning. This work highlights the effectiveness of pretraining on well-designed synthetic graphs to build robust graph foundation models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However, these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior, allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models.

<div> compression, diffusion models, SlimDiff, activation-informed, spectral approximation

Summary:
SlimDiff is a new automated compression framework for diffusion models (DMs) that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. The framework leverages activation covariances across denoising timesteps to guide dynamic pruning, achieving up to 35% acceleration and around 100 million parameter reduction compared to baselines. SlimDiff reframes compression as a spectral approximation task, decomposing functional weight groups to adaptively allocate sparsity and respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. This approach maintains generation quality on par with uncompressed models, requiring only 500 calibration samples, significantly fewer than previous methods. SlimDiff is the first training-free, activation-guided structural compression method for DMs, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2509.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization, timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement fine-tuning, reward over-optimization, rubric-based rewards, off-policy examples, LLM post-training improvements <br />
Summary: 
Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often faces reward over-optimization, caused by a lack of distinction between Excellent and Great responses. To address this, the focus is shifted to the high-reward tail region. However, tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. Off-policy exemplars offer a solution but training on them may lead to a misalignment of rewards. A solution proposed is rubric-based rewards, utilizing off-policy examples while being insensitive to artifacts. The importance of distinguishing diverse responses is emphasized, and a workflow is introduced for implementation. Empirical evidence shows that rubric-based rewards effectively mitigate reward over-optimization and enhance LLM post-training results. The code is available at https://github.com/Jun-Kai-Zhang/rubrics.git. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

<div> Keywords: cMIM, representation learning, contrastive objective, mutual information, discriminative tasks

Summary: 
The article introduces the contrastive Mutual Information Machine (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) by adding a contrastive objective to enhance representation learning. cMIM addresses the challenge of transferring representations to diverse downstream tasks by balancing generative fidelity with discriminative capabilities. The framework does not require positive data augmentation and is less sensitive to batch size compared to InfoNCE. Additionally, the concept of informative embeddings is introduced to extract enriched features from encoder-decoder models, boosting discriminative performance without extra training. Empirical evidence across vision and molecular benchmarks shows that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE in classification and regression tasks while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. These findings establish cMIM as a comprehensive framework for representation learning that efficiently serves both generative and discriminative applications. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms -- contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders -- balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE. Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning, advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative applications effectively.

DistillKac is a fast image generator utilizing the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. Unlike diffusion models, Kac dynamics ensure globally bounded kinetic energy and finite speed transport. The system introduces classifier-free guidance in velocity space while maintaining square integrability. Endpoint distillation trains a student model to match a frozen teacher over extended periods, with a stability result ensuring consistency along the entire path. Experimental results confirm that DistillKac generates high-quality samples with minimal function evaluations, while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows. <div>

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving Knowledge Tracing (KT) models by incorporating predictive uncertainty to detect student errors more effectively, particularly when students choose distractors. The research shows that a higher predictive uncertainty in KT models corresponds to incorrect predictions, making it a valuable signal for identifying student misconceptions. This uncertainty can aid in enhancing pedagogical strategies in educational platforms, especially in resource-constrained environments where understanding student abilities is crucial. The approach presented offers a promising avenue for refining KT models and improving their usefulness in educational settings. <div>

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor, leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions. We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student ability is necessary.

<div> grokking, delayed generalization, $\mathbf{Li_2$, 2-layer nonlinear networks, backpropagated gradient <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, $\mathbf{Li_2$, to explain the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks. It identifies three key stages: Lazy learning, independent feature learning, and interactive feature learning, based on the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$. In Lazy learning, the top layer overfits to random hidden representation. Independent feature learning sees each hidden node learning its representation independently, following the gradient ascent of an energy function and forming local maxima as emerging features. The study assesses the generalizability and representation power of these features in group arithmetic tasks. Interactive feature learning explores how hidden nodes interact and adapt to focus on missing features. The analysis delves into the impact of hyperparameters on grokking, providing scaling laws for memorization and generalization and explaining the effectiveness of recent optimizers like Muon from gradient dynamics principles. It also hints at possible extensions to multi-layer architectures. <div>
arXiv:2509.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$ across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

<div> framework, triadic, co-training, semi-supervised learning, SSL

Summary:
The article introduces TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Unlike existing approaches, TRiCo incorporates a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information for a more robust measure of uncertainty. TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among the teacher, students, and generator in a Stackelberg game framework. The teacher adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing, while the generator perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. TRiCo addresses limitations in existing SSL frameworks, providing state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes. It is architecture-agnostic, compatible with frozen vision backbones, and offers a principled and generalizable solution for SSL. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TRiCo in enhancing SSL performance.

arXiv:2509.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Summary: 
The paper introduces BRT-Align, a framework for ensuring safety in large language models (LLMs) during inference. By modeling autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and using backward reachability to estimate the worst-case trajectory evolution, BRT-Align enables early detection of unsafe completions and minimally perturbs generation to avoid unsafe regions. Experimental results show that BRT-Align outperforms baseline methods in detecting and preventing unsafe content while maintaining sentence diversity and coherence. The framework effectively reduces the generation of violent, profane, offensive, and politically biased responses, showcasing its alignment properties. BRT-Align offers a principled and practical solution for enhancing safety in LLMs at inference time, addressing concerns about harmful content generation. <br /><br /> <div>

The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Summary: 
Data augmentation is a common technique used to enhance model performance by generating synthetic examples for training datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like healthcare, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation poses risks of producing inaccurate or misleading information. To address this challenge, a novel query-based model collaboration framework was introduced in this study. By incorporating expert domain knowledge into the augmentation process, the framework guides the generation of synthetic data to preserve critical medical information. Experimental results on clinical prediction tasks showed that the collaboration-based approach outperformed existing LLM augmentation methods consistently, while also reducing factual errors and improving safety. This framework bridges the gap between the potential of LLM augmentation and the safety requirements of specialized domains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety requirements of specialized domains.

<div> induction heads, large language models, in-context learning, transformer language models, token sequences<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at in-context learning, leveraging induction heads to support this ability in Transformer Language Models. These heads facilitate prediction by making tokens attend to past instances of the same token in the input. However, for more complex hierarchical patterns, such as those found in natural language, a more adaptive approach is needed. In a synthetic in-context learning task, it was observed that uniform attention to all successor tokens is insufficient for accurate predictions. LLMs with adaptive induction heads were found to excel in predicting future tokens by learning to attend to the relevant context. The study also revealed that induction heads learn in-context by identifying latent contexts that determine token transition relationships. This complete mechanistic account sheds light on how LLMs can predict higher-order repetitive patterns effectively in-context. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens. Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns. However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner, they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens. Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals, our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities, suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive abilities.

Summary:
The book explores the process of selection in learning, whether natural or artificial, emphasizing the role of statistical tools in controlling uncertainty. It discusses concentration of measure inequalities to manage the deviation of empirical estimates from true expectations. Various inequalities are covered, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Hoeffding's. The book then delves into offline supervised learning, offering tools for deriving generalization bounds like Occam's razor and PAC-Bayesian analysis. Further, it applies these concepts to online learning, examining regret in stochastic and adversarial environments. Performance measures in online learning are defined by regret, comparing algorithm performance to the best prediction rule retrospectively. Tools for deriving regret bounds are presented for different feedback types, including bandit feedback. Overall, the book provides a comprehensive overview of statistical methods in the context of machine learning and selection under uncertainty.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy, leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's, Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl. We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor, Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and bandit feedback.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Gumbel Dynamical Model (GDM) as a solution to the limitations of traditional switching dynamical systems in capturing smooth and variable-speed transitions in time series data. By introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete states and a noise model based on the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the available state dynamics, allowing for a more faithful approximation of non-stationary ground-truth dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling efficient training with standard gradient descent methods. GDM has been validated on simulation datasets, showcasing its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions in a stochastic setting. Additionally, GDM has been applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in inferring interpretable states in stochastic time series with multiple dynamics, a task where traditional methods often struggle. <div>
arXiv:2509.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often fail.

Summary: 
This paper introduces GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to uncertainty quantification in operator learning. The method avoids constructing a likelihood by utilizing a generative hyper-network model to generate parameter distributions consistent with observed data. GenUQ outperforms other uncertainty quantification methods in various example problems, including recovering a manufactured operator, learning a solution operator for a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling failure locations of porous steel under tension. This approach opens up new possibilities for integrating uncertainty quantification into operator models without relying on likelihood-based methods, showing promising results in various applications such as sea ice modeling, combustion, and atmospheric physics. <div>
arXiv:2509.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Summary: <br />
Federated continual learning (FCL) is a challenging task due to catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity in decentralized settings. FedProTIP addresses this issue by projecting client updates to reduce interference with previously learned representations. This helps in preserving performance across tasks in a task sequence. Additionally, a lightweight mechanism is incorporated in FedProTIP to predict task identity and adjust the global model's outputs dynamically. Experimental results show that FedProTIP outperforms existing methods in average accuracy, especially in scenarios where task identities are unknown. <div>

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model. This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a priori unknown.

Summary:
Projected abstractions are introduced as a new type of abstractions that generalize existing definitions to accommodate lossy representations. These abstractions bridge complex low-level causal models with simple high-level ones and handle situations where multiple low-level interventions can lead to the same high-level intervention. A graphical criteria is proposed for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data when the true model is unknown. The study demonstrates how to construct a projected abstraction from the low-level model and translate observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to high-level. The effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image settings is experimentally shown. <div>
arXiv:2509.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image settings.

Summary:  
LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression) introduces a framework for efficient on-device learning by utilizing one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce memory and computational costs. By obtaining a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection, LANCE eliminates the need for repeated decompositions and allows for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices. The fixed low-rank subspaces enable allocation of tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that LANCE significantly reduces activation storage while maintaining high accuracy on various datasets. In continual learning benchmarks, LANCE achieves competitive performance with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. This makes LANCE a practical and scalable solution for efficient on-device learning in resource-constrained environments.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Summary: 
Training large models with millions to billions of parameters is resource-intensive but most learning occurs early in training, stabilizing over time to a low intrinsic rank. This study proposes switching from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on the level of convergence in the ViT-Large model. By defining user-specific hyperparameters and assigning ranks to module layers, the approach reduces trainable parameters to 10% of the original size. Results show a 3x improvement in throughput, 1.5x reduction in training time per epoch, and a 20% decrease in GPU memory consumption. This method maintains model accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency and memory usage.

arXiv:2509.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank. Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence. Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size, resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for predicting molecular Hessians in computational chemistry using deep learning. Traditional methods for calculating Hessians are computationally expensive and scale poorly with system size. The proposed method, known as HIP (Hessian Interaction Prediction), utilizes SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations features during message passing in graph neural networks. By directly predicting the Hessians, HIP is significantly faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, and easier to train. It also demonstrates improved performance in tasks such as transition state search, geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis. The authors have made the HIP codebase and model weights available on GitHub for further development. <div>

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

<div> Keywords: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, heterogeneous reasoning transformations, low-rank adaptation, Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation, blockwise design<br />
Summary: 
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods need to be both resource-efficient and capable of handling various reasoning transformations. Classical low-rank adaptation methods are limited by a fixed rank, while Hadamard-style extensions like HiRA can raise the rank but are constrained by global modulation. ABBA trades off this constraint for fully learned dense intermediates. In response to the limitations of global modulation, Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA) partitions weight matrices, allowing for HiRA-style modulation within each block independently. This approach maintains a rich spectrum across different rank budgets, preventing collapse induced by global modulation. Through empirical analyses on multiple tasks, including common sense reasoning and arithmetic benchmarks, BHRA consistently outperforms strong parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines with matched parameter budgets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA), which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets, mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched parameter budgets.

<div> mask-based pretraining, test risk, minimum-norm linear regression, Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding, multi-scale features

Summary: Mask-based pretraining has been widely used in various fields such as language, vision, and biology, but its underlying mechanisms have been unclear. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on high-dimensional minimum-norm linear regression to analyze the behavior of mask-based pretraining. The analysis reveals that a simple pretraining scheme called Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE) can outperform traditional masking methods by capturing multi-scale features from the data. The framework has been validated on different neural architectures and tasks, leading to improvements in state-of-the-art models. The code for R$^2$MAE is publicly available, providing a new approach to improve the performance of large-scale models. <div>

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success, its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less") linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers) applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for state-of-the-art models.

<div> mathematical definitions, safety, trust, AGI, incompatibility

Summary:
- The paper proposes strict mathematical definitions for safety, trust, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in AI systems.
- A fundamental incompatibility between safety, trust, and AGI is demonstrated within the proposed definitions.
- Safety is defined as the property of never making false claims, trust as assuming the system is safe, and AGI as exceeding human capability.
- The core finding is that a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system based on these definitions, as there are tasks solvable by humans but not the system.
- The paper explores program verification, planning, and graph reachability, drawing parallels to Godel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem.

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's results.

<div> DriftLite, scaling, diffusion models, training-free, particle-based<br />
<br />
Summary: The article introduces DriftLite, a lightweight and training-free particle-based method for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to new target distributions without retraining. By leveraging an unexplored degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation, DriftLite offers Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) to optimize drift with minimal computational overhead. This approach ensures optimal stability control during inference dynamics, outperforming existing guidance-based methods that introduce bias and particle-based corrections prone to weight degeneracy and high computational costs. DriftLite demonstrates consistent improvements in sample quality and variance reduction across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding problems, highlighting its effectiveness in scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models. <div>

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining. Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models.

<div> differentiable structure learning, discrete data, dependencies, identifiability, optimization

Summary:
The article introduces a differentiable structure learning framework for discrete data that can capture arbitrary dependencies. Unlike existing methods, this framework does not assume data is generated from specific structural equation models, making it more widely applicable. The framework considers the complex dependence structure inherent in discrete data and allows for non-linear effects. It demonstrates that although general discrete models may be unidentifiable from observational data alone, the complete set of compatible parameters and structures can be characterized. Identifiability up to Markov equivalence is established under mild assumptions. The learning problem is formulated as a single differentiable optimization task in its most general form, avoiding the simplifications of previous methods. Empirical results show that this approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data. <div>

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore, current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures. Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning.

Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose directions for future research.

Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) involves generating step-by-step instructions using text and images while maintaining object-state consistency. MMPlanner is a zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT) prompting for accurate plans.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models (LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by +11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

Summary:<br />Neurosymbolic integration, a field combining neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning, can be enhanced by Logic of Hypotheses (LoH). LoH introduces a choice operator to extend propositional logic syntax, enabling the integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge.

The framework subsumes existing NeSy models and provides the flexibility for knowledge specification. By utilizing Goedel fuzzy logic and the Goedel trick, models can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without loss of performance. Experimental analysis on tabular data and Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability of decision rules generated by these models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands, enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models, while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification. Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models, showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task, while producing interpretable decision rules.

<div> Regularization, Deep Learning, Monotonicity, Overfitting, Predictive Performance <br />
<br />
This paper introduces a new regularization method called Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM) to address overfitting issues in deep learning models. The proposed method enforces monotonic relationships based on domain knowledge, penalizing deviations from expected trends relative to a linear baseline. By incorporating constraints on model behavior during training, DIM enhances predictive performance across various neural network architectures. The approach is formalized through a mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. Experimental results using real-world ridesourcing data from Chicago and synthetic datasets demonstrate that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently improve model performance. DIM proves to be an effective strategy for improving model generalization and mitigating the effects of overfitting in deep learning applications. <br />
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe: a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions. First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models, Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at https://neuroprobe.dev/

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.

Summary: 
This paper presents a new approach to solving the challenging $K$-means clustering problem by formulating it as a smooth unconstrained optimization over a submanifold. By characterizing its Riemannian structures, the problem can be solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. The $K$-means manifold is factorized into a product manifold, allowing each Newton subproblem to be solved in linear time. Through numerical experiments, the proposed method is shown to converge significantly faster than existing first-order methods while achieving optimal statistical accuracy. This approach addresses the difficulty of balancing constraint feasibility and objective optimality in current relaxation algorithms, providing a promising solution for cluster recovery challenges. <div>
arXiv:2509.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications, such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks, compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large vision-language models.

Summary:
SpecMER is introduced as a framework for protein sequence generation that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. It aims to address the limitations of speculative decoding in protein engineering by improving sequence plausibility and retaining efficiency. SpecMER scores candidate sequences in parallel and selects those most consistent with known biological patterns, enhancing the quality of generated sequences. Results show that SpecMER achieves a 24-32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods. This novel approach combines the benefits of speculative decoding with the integration of biological constraints, leading to more biologically plausible and efficient protein sequence generation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However, their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling. Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the 0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research. Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad optimization technique.

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve transportation services and urban development.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems (LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for efficient and scalable computation.

<title>Information-Theoretic Bayesian Optimization for Bilevel Optimization Problems</title>

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper- and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously. Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently. To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels: trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular optimization.

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease detection tasks.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes. HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free learning.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single, unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably, unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability to settings with limited reference information.

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test [NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus (sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

<title>Beyond Formula Complexity: Effective Information Criterion Improves Performance and Interpretability for Symbolic Regression</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system. We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts' preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's interpretability.

<title>FastGRPO: Accelerating Policy Optimization via Concurrency-aware Speculative Decoding and Online Draft Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck. Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration, its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels, thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/yedaotian9/GRPO_speculative.

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of fatigue monitoring systems.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries, semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses. Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers -- points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated minimizers.

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward challenges in online MARL.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1) overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with $\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU) approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of $O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the $\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based language models developed under masking paradigm.

<title>Beyond Johnson-Lindenstrauss: Uniform Bounds for Sketched Bilinear Forms</title>

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as $\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather than the ambient dimension.

<title>Graph of Agents: Principled Long Context Modeling by Emergent Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length.

<title>MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

<title>Beyond RAG vs. Long-Context: Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval for Efficient Knowledge Grounding</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

<title>Abductive Logical Rule Induction by Bridging Inductive Logic Programming and Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs, which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

<title>Zubov-Net: Adaptive Stability for Neural ODEs Reconciling Accuracy with Robustness</title>

arXiv:2509.21879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net, which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs (PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses (consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function. To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures. Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

<title>Position: The Hidden Costs and Measurement Gaps of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math, code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax, evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models, we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean, parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive: RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

<title>Closing the Oracle Gap: Increment Vector Transformation for Class Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21898</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding, we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths, IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<title>Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However, such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks. The code is available through https://github.com/WanZhengyan/Discrete-Guidance-Matching/tree/main.

<title>Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects</title>

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process. Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.

<title>Generation Properties of Stochastic Interpolation under Finite Training Set</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise. Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as classification support our theory.

arXiv:2509.21934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy analytics.

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the structural information gain of each state community and use it as a conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

arXiv:2509.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/active_attacks}{here}.

<title>Think Smart, Not Hard: Difficulty Adaptive Reasoning for Large Audio Language Models</title>

arXiv:2509.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a ``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm offers valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral, but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction, diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL) agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch. In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning (SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically, the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications: (1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers. Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

<title>AEGIS: Authentic Edge Growth In Sparsity for Link Prediction in Edge-Sparse Bipartite Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC (higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional boost when informative node descriptions are available.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass, Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters. The code of this work will be released.

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures, our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning, we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and stochastic optimization.

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry, yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance; physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead. We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures, MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces \workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further explorations of latent space.

arXiv:2509.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold, and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

arXiv:2509.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper, we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem, (ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

<title>Enriching Knowledge Distillation with Intra-Class Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively. Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

arXiv:2509.22056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness. To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch. Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of learning tasks. However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN. Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering improved scalability.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive, resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical recourse systems.

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics, continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete development.

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<title>Learning More with Less: A Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling Framework for Efficient Policy Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling (D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.

<title>Slicing Wasserstein Over Wasserstein Via Functional Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional $L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

<title>Pushing Toward the Simplex Vertices: A Simple Remedy for Code Collapse in Smoothed Vector Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22161</link>

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its $K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks, including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

<title>Lightweight error mitigation strategies for post-training N:M activation sparsity in LLMs</title>

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

<title>Efficiency Boost in Decentralized Optimization: Reimagining Neighborhood Aggregation with Minimal Overhead</title>

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies, demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for widespread integration.

<title>Learning Equivariant Functions via Quadratic Forms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22184</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22184</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown) equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$ corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms, while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple. This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

<title>Mechanistic Independence: A Principle for Identifiable Disentangled Representations</title>

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution. This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework, we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components. Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

<title>Kernel Regression of Multi-Way Data via Tensor Trains with Hadamard Overparametrization: The Dynamic Graph Flow Case</title>

arXiv:2509.22197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation, termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization (KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based (topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

<title>Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.

<title>A Law of Data Reconstruction for Random Features (and Beyond)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

arXiv:2509.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable, symmetry-aware representations.

<title>Fairness-Aware Reinforcement Learning (FAReL): A Framework for Transparent and Balanced Sequential Decision-Making</title>

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored. Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward. Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

<title>ASSESS: A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity</title>

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED (Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524 expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE, recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph structure is important.

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning" during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge. Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1) adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage. This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU), and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis applications.

arXiv:2509.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps, diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore, extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic setup.

<title>A Multi-Level Framework for Multi-Objective Hypergraph Partitioning: Combining Minimum Spanning Tree and Proximal Gradient</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse $k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration, swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to 35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis, Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

<title>Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

<title>HEAPr: Hessian-based Efficient Atomic Expert Pruning in Output Space</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information, HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs nearly by 20%.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed, machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness, we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be explored for other applications.

<title>Adaptive Policy Backbone via Shared Network</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains, yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data, limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB), a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically fail.

<title>Progressive Weight Loading: Accelerating Initial Inference and Gradually Boosting Performance on Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

<title>Spectral Collapse Drives Loss of Plasticity in Deep Continual Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.22335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity} in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$ penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

<title>SurvDiff: A Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Data in Survival Analysis</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death. Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis. SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase the diversity of the generated text.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000 feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting network depth.

<title>Investigating Faithfulness in Large Audio Language Models</title>

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere. Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx, inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc 97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc 96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making, necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree; unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI, however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats. However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information games like poker.

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12 datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

arXiv:2509.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However, such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound. Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

arXiv:2509.22411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration, effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic systems.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks. Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

<title>Partial Parameter Updates for Efficient Distributed Training</title>

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

<title>Learning from Delayed Feedback in Games via Extra Prediction</title>

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant ($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and strengthened by our experiments.

<title>The Flood Complex: Large-Scale Persistent Homology on Millions of Points</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points. Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed, especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point cloud data.

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency. However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training, particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in real-world applications.

<title>Bridging Kolmogorov Complexity and Deep Learning: Asymptotically Optimal Description Length Objectives for Transformers</title>

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled, universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis. PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$, recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation (SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$ (diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$ PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

<title>Physics-informed GNN for medium-high voltage AC power flow with edge-aware attention and line search correction operator</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers, especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$ faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network surrogate.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET, significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with comparable speed.

<title>Learning the Neighborhood: Contrast-Free Multimodal Self-Supervised Molecular Graph Pretraining</title>

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction, indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA, suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues, practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting, proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning (DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however, not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications, necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space, while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e., bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit. It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries, such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper, we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where product utilities are non-additive.

<title>Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model $g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past. However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events. For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

<title>EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

<title>The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?</title>

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EDGE.

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

<title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and {entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning. Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner mechanics of model adaptation.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources: (i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

<title>Learning Admissible Heuristics for A*: Theory and Practice</title>

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize. Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.

<title>Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly, slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity. Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%) by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance, highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping. This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES, Raman, FTIR).

Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.

Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.

Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT, DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint, information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning (SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE), and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17; around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics, contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE), demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Abstract: Accurately assessing mental workload is crucial in cognitive neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and real-time monitoring, as cognitive load fluctuations affect performance and decision-making. While Electroencephalography (EEG) based machine learning (ML) models can be used to this end, their high computational cost hinders embedded real-time applications. Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This study compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones, using an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal integration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one, demonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load detection. These findings position event-based processing as a promising solution for low-latency, energy efficient workload monitoring in adaptive closed-loop embedded devices that dynamically regulate cognitive load.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity - particularly during periods of rapid intensification and rapid weakening - remains a challenge for operational meteorology, with high-stakes implications for disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience. Recent advances in machine learning have yielded notable progress in TC prediction; however, most existing systems provide forecasts that degrade rapidly in extreme regimes and lack long-range consistency. Here we introduce TIFNet, a transformer-based forecasting model that generates non-iterative, 5-day intensity trajectories by integrating high-resolution global forecasts with a historical-evolution fusion mechanism. Trained on reanalysis data and fine-tuned with operational data, TIFNet consistently outperforms operational numerical models across all forecast horizons, delivering robust improvements across weak, strong, and super typhoon categories. In rapid intensity change regimes - long regarded as the most difficult to forecast - TIFNet reduces forecast error by 29-43% relative to current operational baselines. These results represent a substantial advance in artificial-intelligence-based TC intensity forecasting, especially under extreme conditions where traditional models consistently underperform.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment.

Abstract: The properties of complexes with transuranium elements have long been the object of research in various fields of chemistry. However, their experimental study is complicated by their rarity, high cost and special conditions necessary for working with such elements, and the complexity of quantum chemical calculations does not allow their use for large systems. To overcome these problems, we used modern machine learning methods to create a novel neural network architecture that allows to use available experimental data on a number of elements and thus significantly improve the quality of the resulting models. We also described the applicability domain of the presented model and identified the molecular fragments that most influence the stability of the complexes.

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset, referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent, lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

<title>The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms</title>

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well, highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information. Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups, including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as open-source software.

<title>Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time. However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining. In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation, reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

<title>Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence</title>

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making. However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5 km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections. Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.

<title>DyME: Dynamic Multi-Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Bi-Level Orthogonal LoRA Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.

GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Abstract: Bluetooth-based mesh networks offer a promising infrastructure for offline communication in emergency and resource constrained scenarios. However, traditional routing strategies such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) often degrade under congestion and dynamic topological changes. This study proposes a hybrid intelligent routing framework that augments AODV with supervised machine learning to improve next-hop selection under varied network constraints. The framework integrates four predictive models: a delivery success classifier, a TTL regressor, a delay regressor, and a forwarder suitability classifier, into a unified scoring mechanism that dynamically ranks neighbors during multi-hop message transmission. A simulation environment with stationary node deployments was developed, incorporating buffer constraints and device heterogeneity to evaluate three strategies: baseline AODV, a partial hybrid ML model (ABC), and the full hybrid ML model (ABCD). Across ten scenarios, the Hybrid ABCD model achieves approximately 99.97 percent packet delivery under these controlled conditions, significantly outperforming both the baseline and intermediate approaches. The results demonstrate that lightweight, explainable machine learning models can enhance routing reliability and adaptability in Bluetooth mesh networks, particularly in infrastructure-less environments where delivery success is prioritized over latency constraints.

Abstract: With the increased interest in artificial intelligence, Machine Learning as a Service provides the infrastructure in the Cloud for easy training, testing, and deploying models. However, these systems have a major privacy issue: uploading sensitive data to the Cloud, especially during training. Therefore, achieving secure Neural Network training has been on many researchers' minds lately. More and more solutions for this problem are built around a main pillar: Functional Encryption (FE). Although these approaches are very interesting and offer a new perspective on ML training over encrypted data, some vulnerabilities do not seem to be taken into consideration. In our paper, we present an attack on neural networks that uses FE for secure training over encrypted data. Our approach uses linear programming to reconstruct the original input, unveiling the previous security promises. To address the attack, we propose two solutions for secure training and inference that involve the client during the computation phase. One approach ensures security without relying on encryption, while the other uses function-hiding inner-product techniques.

<title>New Algorithmic Directions in Optimal Transport and Applications for Product Spaces</title>

Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions $\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$. Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under $\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be "sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For $\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

In order to answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%. After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap. A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

<title>No Alignment Needed for Generation: Learning Linearly Separable Representations in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

<title>General Pruning Criteria for Fast SBL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) associates to each weight in the underlying linear model a hyperparameter by assuming that each weight is Gaussian distributed with zero mean and precision (inverse variance) equal to its associated hyperparameter. The method estimates the hyperparameters by marginalizing out the weights and performing (marginalized) maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. SBL returns many hyperparameter estimates to diverge to infinity, effectively setting the estimates of the corresponding weights to zero (i.e., pruning the corresponding weights from the model) and thereby yielding a sparse estimate of the weight vector.
  In this letter, we analyze the marginal likelihood as function of a single hyperparameter while keeping the others fixed, when the Gaussian assumptions on the noise samples and the weight distribution that underlies the derivation of SBL are weakened. We derive sufficient conditions that lead, on the one hand, to finite hyperparameter estimates and, on the other, to infinite ones. Finally, we show that in the Gaussian case, the two conditions are complementary and coincide with the pruning condition of fast SBL (F-SBL), thereby providing additional insights into this algorithm.

<title>IndiSeek learns information-guided disentangled representations</title>

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity. We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM, while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of some popular adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods in the small learning rate regime. Using the stochastic modified equations framework introduced by Li et al., we derive effective continuous stochastic dynamics for these methods. Our key contribution is that sampling-induced noise in SGD manifests in the limit as independent Brownian motions driving the parameter and gradient second momentum evolutions. Furthermore, extending the approach of Malladi et al., we investigate scaling rules between the learning rate and key hyperparameters in adaptive methods, characterising all non-trivial limiting dynamics.

<title>OjaKV: Context-Aware Online Low-Rank KV Cache Compression with Oja's Rule</title>

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion, while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0 meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

Abstract: We propose a conversion scheme that turns regret minimizing algorithms into fixed point iterations, with convergence guarantees following from regret bounds. The resulting iterations can be seen as a grand extension of the classical Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations, as the latter are recovered by converting the Online Gradient Descent algorithm. This approach yields new simple iterations for finding fixed points of non-self operators. We also focus on converting algorithms from the AdaGrad family of regret minimizers, and thus obtain fixed point iterations with adaptive guarantees of a new kind. Numerical experiments on various problems demonstrate faster convergence of AdaGrad-based fixed point iterations over Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations.

Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end, we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss, thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability. Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning, and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art geometric method.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Current anti-spoofing systems remain vulnerable to expressive and emotional synthetic speech, since they rarely leverage prosody as a discriminative cue. Prosody is central to human expressiveness and emotion, and humans instinctively use prosodic cues such as F0 patterns and voiced/unvoiced structure to distinguish natural from synthetic speech. In this paper, we propose HuLA, a two-stage prosody-aware multi-task learning framework for spoof detection. In Stage 1, a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone is trained on real speech with auxiliary tasks of F0 prediction and voiced/unvoiced classification, enhancing its ability to capture natural prosodic variation similar to human perceptual learning. In Stage 2, the model is jointly optimized for spoof detection and prosody tasks on both real and synthetic data, leveraging prosodic awareness to detect mismatches between natural and expressive synthetic speech. Experiments show that HuLA consistently outperforms strong baselines on challenging out-of-domain dataset, including expressive, emotional, and cross-lingual attacks. These results demonstrate that explicit prosodic supervision, combined with SSL embeddings, substantially improves robustness against advanced synthetic speech attacks.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face scarce labeled data due to the high cost and time requirements of gold-standard experiments, whereas unlabeled data are typically abundant. With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques, it has become increasingly feasible to generate multiple predicted labels using a variety of models and algorithms, including deep learning, large language models, and generative AI. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that safely and adaptively aggregates multiple black-box predictions with unknown quality while preserving valid statistical inference. Our method provides two key guarantees: (i) it never performs worse than using the labeled data alone, regardless of the quality of the predictions; and (ii) if any one of the predictions (without knowing which one) perfectly fits the ground truth, the algorithm adaptively exploits this to achieve either a faster convergence rate or the semiparametric efficiency bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As data collection and simulation capabilities advance, multi-modal learning, the task of learning from multiple modalities and sources of data, is becoming an increasingly important area of research. Surrogate models that learn from data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation in the presence of partially missing observations. We demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to uni-modal surrogate models for both scalar and time series data.

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout. This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Automatic drum transcription (ADT) is traditionally formulated as a discriminative task to predict drum events from audio spectrograms. In this work, we redefine ADT as a conditional generative task and introduce Noise-to-Notes (N2N), a framework leveraging diffusion modeling to transform audio-conditioned Gaussian noise into drum events with associated velocities. This generative diffusion approach offers distinct advantages, including a flexible speed-accuracy trade-off and strong inpainting capabilities. However, the generation of binary onset and continuous velocity values presents a challenge for diffusion models, and to overcome this, we introduce an Annealed Pseudo-Huber loss to facilitate effective joint optimization. Finally, to augment low-level spectrogram features, we propose incorporating features extracted from music foundation models (MFMs), which capture high-level semantic information and enhance robustness to out-of-domain drum audio. Experimental results demonstrate that including MFM features significantly improves robustness and N2N establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across multiple ADT benchmarks.

<title>Self-Speculative Biased Decoding for Faster Live Translation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation), where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications. Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only mask-k technique.

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces, but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable ``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks. Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

<title>Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing</title>

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings, and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2) collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining 5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete instructions.

<title>SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs' catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats. Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

<title>Causal-EPIG: A Prediction-Oriented Active Learning Framework for CATE Estimation</title>

Abstract: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is often constrained by the high cost of obtaining outcome measurements, making active learning essential. However, conventional active learning strategies suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch. They are designed to reduce uncertainty in model parameters or in observable factual outcomes, failing to directly target the unobservable causal quantities that are the true objects of interest. To address this misalignment, we introduce the principle of causal objective alignment, which posits that acquisition functions should target unobservable causal quantities, such as the potential outcomes and the CATE, rather than indirect proxies. We operationalize this principle through the Causal-EPIG framework, which adapts the information-theoretic criterion of Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) to explicitly quantify the value of a query in terms of reducing uncertainty about unobservable causal quantities. From this unified framework, we derive two distinct strategies that embody a fundamental trade-off: a comprehensive approach that robustly models the full causal mechanisms via the joint potential outcomes, and a focused approach that directly targets the CATE estimand for maximum sample efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategies consistently outperform standard baselines, and crucially, reveal that the optimal strategy is context-dependent, contingent on the base estimator and data complexity. Our framework thus provides a principled guide for sample-efficient CATE estimation in practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.

<title>Elastic MoE: Unlocking the Inference-Time Scalability of Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts $k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However, contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings. Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher level.

Abstract: Discrete flow models offer a powerful framework for learning distributions over discrete state spaces and have demonstrated superior performance compared to the discrete diffusion model. However, their convergence properties and error analysis remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a unified framework grounded in stochastic calculus theory to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of discrete flow. Specifically, we derive the KL divergence of two path measures regarding two continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with different transition rates by developing a novel Girsanov-type theorem, and provide a comprehensive analysis that encompasses the error arising from transition rate estimation and early stopping, where the first type of error has rarely been analyzed by existing works. Unlike discrete diffusion models, discrete flow incurs no truncation error caused by truncating the time horizon in the noising process. Building on generator matching and uniformization, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution estimation. Our results provide the first error analysis for discrete flow models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on (randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean ($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le \sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big( \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} + \log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional $\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more complicated (non-interval) queries.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.

<title>Learnable Conformal Prediction with Context-Aware Nonconformity Functions for Robotic Planning and Perception</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to 91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being 7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.

<title>ERGO: Efficient High-Resolution Visual Understanding for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nota-github/ERGO.

<title>Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing</title>

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

<title>A Nonparametric Discrete Hawkes Model with a Collapsed Gaussian-Process Prior</title>

Abstract: Hawkes process models are used in settings where past events increase the likelihood of future events occurring. Many applications record events as counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation. This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends, periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and weekly Cryptosporidiosis counts, it improves test predictive log-likelihood over standard parametric discrete Hawkes baselines while capturing bursts, delays, and seasonal background variation. The results indicate that flexible discrete-time self-excitation can be achieved without sacrificing scalability or interpretability.

<title>GSM-Agent: Understanding Agentic Reasoning Using Controllable Environments</title>

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in a teacher student setting with a linear teacher with oracle weights. Leveraging random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and using cDDPM as an architecture.

<title>Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates, $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term $h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$ is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Regularized linear regression is central to machine learning, yet its high-dimensional behavior with informative priors remains poorly understood. We provide the first exact asymptotic characterization of training and test risks for maximum a posteriori (MAP) regression with Gaussian priors centered at a domain-informed initialization. Our framework unifies ridge regression, least squares, and prior-informed estimators, and -- using random matrix theory -- yields closed-form risk formulas that expose the bias-variance-prior tradeoff, explain double descent, and quantify prior mismatch. We also identify a closed-form minimizer of test risk, enabling a simple estimator of the optimal regularization parameter. Simulations confirm the theory with high accuracy. By connecting Bayesian priors, classical regularization, and modern asymptotics, our results provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for learning with structured prior knowledge.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces. We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+ layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing applications.

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus, uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks. COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

<title>Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models</title>

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation, their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.

Abstract: Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse. For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes -- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.

Abstract: Classification using variational quantum circuits is a promising frontier in quantum machine learning. Quantum supervised learning (QSL) applied to classical data using variational quantum circuits involves embedding the data into a quantum Hilbert space and optimizing the circuit parameters to train the measurement process. In this context, the efficacy of QSL is inherently influenced by the selection of quantum embedding. In this study, we introduce a classical-quantum hybrid approach for optimizing quantum embedding beyond the limitations of the standard circuit model of quantum computation (i.e., completely positive and trace-preserving maps) for general multi-channel data. We benchmark the performance of various models in our framework using the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets and provide theoretical analyses that guide model design and optimization.

Abstract: Most uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches provide a single scalar value as a measure of model reliability. However, different uncertainty measures could provide complementary information on the prediction confidence. Even measures targeting the same type of uncertainty (e.g., ensemble-based and density-based measures of epistemic uncertainty) may capture different failure modes.
  We take a multidimensional view on UQ by stacking complementary UQ measures into a vector. Such vectors are assigned with Monge-Kantorovich ranks produced by an optimal-transport-based ordering method. The prediction is then deemed more uncertain than the other if it has a higher rank.
  The resulting VecUQ-OT algorithm uses entropy-regularized optimal transport. The transport map is learned on vectors of scores from in-distribution data and, by design, applies to unseen inputs, including out-of-distribution cases, without retraining.
  Our framework supports flexible non-additive uncertainty fusion (including aleatoric and epistemic components). It yields a robust ordering for downstream tasks such as selective prediction, misclassification detection, out-of-distribution detection, and selective generation. Across synthetic, image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows high efficiency even when individual measures fail. The code for the method is available at: https://github.com/stat-ml/multidimensional_uncertainty.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications, which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic (FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow, cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity, ``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B testing on a massive scale using real-world applications.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills. A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

<title>Universal Inverse Distillation for Matching Models with Real-Data Supervision (No GANs)</title>

Abstract: While achieving exceptional generative quality, modern diffusion, flow, and other matching models suffer from slow inference, as they require many steps of iterative generation. Recent distillation methods address this by training efficient one-step generators under the guidance of a pre-trained teacher model. However, these methods are often constrained to only one specific framework, e.g., only to diffusion or only to flow models. Furthermore, these methods are naturally data-free, and to benefit from the usage of real data, it is required to use an additional complex adversarial training with an extra discriminator model. In this paper, we present RealUID, a universal distillation framework for all matching models that seamlessly incorporates real data into the distillation procedure without GANs. Our RealUID approach offers a simple theoretical foundation that covers previous distillation methods for Flow Matching and Diffusion models, and is also extended to their modifications, such as Bridge Matching and Stochastic Interpolants.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, but their opacity limits trust and adoption in sensitive domains such as medicine, economics, and public policy. Building on well-established and high-performing causal neural architectures, we propose causalKANs, a framework that transforms neural estimators of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) into Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs). By incorporating pruning and symbolic simplification, causalKANs yields interpretable closed-form formulas while preserving predictive accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that causalKANs perform on par with neural baselines in CATE error metrics, and that even simple KAN variants achieve competitive performance, offering a favorable accuracy--interpretability trade-off. By combining reliability with analytic accessibility, causalKANs provide auditable estimators supported by closed-form expressions and interpretable plots, enabling trustworthy individualized decision-making in high-stakes settings. We release the code for reproducibility at https://github.com/aalmodovares/causalkans .

<title>Evaluating the Limits of Large Language Models in Multilingual Legal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation. We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification, summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24 percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs, challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks, and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models' application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments, including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for constructing statistically rigorous prediction sets. While popular variants such as CD-split improve CP's efficiency, they often yield prediction sets composed of multiple disconnected subintervals, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose SCD-split, which incorporates smoothing operations into the CP framework. Such smoothing operations potentially help merge the subintervals, thus leading to interpretable prediction sets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SCD-split balances the interval length and the number of disconnected subintervals. Theoretically, under specific conditions, SCD-split provably reduces the number of disconnected subintervals while maintaining comparable coverage guarantees and interval length compared with CD-split.

Abstract: In observational settings where treatment and outcome share unmeasured confounders but an observed mediator remains unconfounded, the front-door (FD) adjustment identifies causal effects through the mediator. We study the heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) under FD identification and introduce two debiased learners: FD-DR-Learner and FD-R-Learner. Both attain fast, quasi-oracle rates (i.e., performance comparable to an oracle that knows the nuisances) even when nuisance functions converge as slowly as n^-1/4. We provide error analyses establishing debiasedness and demonstrate robust empirical performance in synthetic studies and a real-world case study of primary seat-belt laws using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset. Together, these results indicate that the proposed learners deliver reliable and sample-efficient HTE estimates in FD scenarios. The implementation is available at https://github.com/yonghanjung/FD-CATE.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for analyzing data modeled as parameterized families of networks. Building on a Gromov-Wasserstein variant of optimal transport, we define a family of parameterized Gromov-Wasserstein distances for comparing such parametric data, including time-varying metric spaces induced by collective motion, temporally evolving weighted social networks, and random graph models. We establish foundational properties of these distances, showing that they subsume several existing metrics in the literature, and derive theoretical approximation guarantees. In particular, we develop computationally tractable lower bounds and relate them to graph statistics commonly used in random graph theory. Furthermore, we prove that our distances can be consistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings via empirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests from the causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to its capability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism into causally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity of modern datasets. In this paper, we further contribute to the CRL literature, by focusing on the stylized linear structural causal model over the latent features and assuming a linear mixing function that maps latent features to the observed data or measurements. Existing linear CRL methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as accessibility to single-node interventional data or restrictive distributional constraints on latent features and exogenous measurement noise. However, these prerequisites can be challenging to satisfy in certain scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel linear CRL algorithm that, unlike most existing linear CRL methods, operates under weaker assumptions about environment heterogeneity and data-generating distributions while still recovering latent causal features up to an equivalence class. We further validate our new algorithm via synthetic experiments and an interpretability analysis of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating both its superiority over competing methods in finite samples and its potential in integrating causality into AI.

<title>Nearly Tight Regret Bounds for Profit Maximization in Bilateral Trade</title>

Abstract: Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.
  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.
  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all mechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present two effective policy learning algorithms for multi-agent online coordination(MA-OC) problem. The first one, \texttt{MA-SPL}, not only can achieve the optimal $(1-\frac{c}{e})$-approximation guarantee for the MA-OC problem with submodular objectives but also can handle the unexplored $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $(\gamma,\beta)$-weakly submodular scenarios, where $c$ is the curvature of the investigated submodular functions, $\alpha$ denotes the diminishing-return(DR) ratio and the tuple $(\gamma,\beta)$ represents the submodularity ratios. Subsequently, in order to reduce the reliance on the unknown parameters $\alpha,\gamma,\beta$ inherent in the \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithm named \texttt{MA-MPL}. This \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely \emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximation ratio as the first \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \texttt{MA-SPL} and \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation technique termed as \emph{policy-based continuous extension}. Compared with the well-established \emph{multi-linear extension}, a notable advantage of this new \emph{policy-based continuous extension} is its ability to provide a lossless rounding scheme for any set function, thereby enabling us to tackle the challenging weakly submodular objectives. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.

<title>SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework</title>

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

<title>StateX: Enhancing RNN Recall via Post-training State Expansion</title>

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts, because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters. Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction. Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

<title>Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards</title>

arXiv:2509.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Abstract: This paper develops a policy learning method for tuning a pre-trained policy to adapt to additional tasks without altering the original task. A method named Adaptive Policy Gradient (APG) is proposed in this paper, which combines Bellman's principle of optimality with the policy gradient approach to improve the convergence rate. This paper provides theoretical analysis which guarantees the convergence rate and sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\epsilon$ denotes the accuracy of the resulting stationary policy. Furthermore, several challenging numerical simulations, including cartpole, lunar lander, and robot arm, are provided to show that APG obtains similar performance compared to existing deterministic policy gradient methods while utilizing much less data and converging at a faster rate.

Abstract: This work introduces an efficient novel approach for epistemic uncertainty estimation for ensemble models for regression tasks using pairwise-distance estimators (PaiDEs). Utilizing the pairwise-distance between model components, these estimators establish bounds on entropy. We leverage this capability to enhance the performance of Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD). Notably, unlike sample-based Monte Carlo estimators, PaiDEs exhibit a remarkable capability to estimate epistemic uncertainty at speeds up to 100 times faster while covering a significantly larger number of inputs at once and demonstrating superior performance in higher dimensions. To validate our approach, we conducted a varied series of regression experiments on commonly used benchmarks: 1D sinusoidal data, $\textit{Pendulum}$, $\textit{Hopper}$, $\textit{Ant}$ and $\textit{Humanoid}$. For each experimental setting, an active learning framework was applied to demonstrate the advantages of PaiDEs for epistemic uncertainty estimation. We compare our approach to existing active learning methods and find that our approach outperforms on high-dimensional regression tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach named Value Decomposition Framework with Disentangled World Model to address the challenge of achieving a common goal of multiple agents interacting in the same environment with reduced sample complexity. Due to scalability and non-stationarity problems posed by multi-agent systems, model-free methods rely on a considerable number of samples for training. In contrast, we use a modularized world model, composed of action-conditioned, action-free, and static branches, to unravel the complicated environment dynamics. Our model produces imagined outcomes based on past experience, without sampling directly from the real environment. We employ variational auto-encoders and variational graph auto-encoders to learn the latent representations for the world model, which is merged with a value-based framework to predict the joint action-value function and optimize the overall training objective. Experimental results on StarCraft II micro-management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges demonstrate that our method achieves high sample efficiency and exhibits superior performance compared to other baselines across a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks.

Abstract: We present algorithms that substantially accelerate partition-based cross-validation for machine learning models that require matrix products $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Our algorithms have applications in model selection for, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), ridge regression (RR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and partial least squares (PLS). Our algorithms support all combinations of column-wise centering and scaling of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, and we demonstrate in our accompanying implementation that this adds only a manageable, practical constant over efficient variants without preprocessing. We prove the correctness of our algorithms under a fold-based partitioning scheme and show that the running time is independent of the number of folds; that is, they have the same time complexity as that of computing $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ and space complexity equivalent to storing $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$, and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Importantly, unlike alternatives found in the literature, we avoid data leakage due to preprocessing. We achieve these results by eliminating redundant computations in the overlap between training partitions. Concretely, we show how to manipulate $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ using only samples from the validation partition to obtain the preprocessed training partition-wise $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. To our knowledge, we are the first to derive correct and efficient cross-validation algorithms for any of the $16$ combinations of column-wise centering and scaling, for which we also prove only $12$ give distinct matrix products.

Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.

Analyzing this concept produces a simple procedure for computing all adversarial Bayes classifiers for a well-motivated family of one dimensional data distributions. This characterization is then leveraged to show that as the perturbation radius increases, certain notions of regularity for the adversarial Bayes classifiers improve. Furthermore, these results provide tools for understanding relationships between the Bayes and adversarial Bayes classifiers in one dimension.

Abstract: The sustainable utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to the global energy transition and carbon neutrality, yet data scarcity and heterogeneity remain major barriers across remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This dissertation develops a machine learning assisted framework to address these challenges throughout the battery lifecycle. A physics informed quality control model predicts long-term degradation from limited early-cycle data, while a generative learning based residual value assessment method enables rapid and accurate evaluation of retired batteries under random conditions. A federated learning strategy achieves privacy preserving and high precision cathode material sorting, supporting efficient recycling. Furthermore, a unified diagnostics and prognostics framework based on correlation alignment enhances adaptability across tasks such as state of health estimation, state of charge estimation, and remaining useful life prediction under varied testing protocols. Collectively, these contributions advance sustainable battery management by integrating physics, data generation, privacy preserving collaboration, and adaptive learning, offering methodological innovations to promote circular economy and global carbon neutrality.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are crucial for the success of deep neural networks, but labeling data can be prohibitively expensive in domains such as medical imaging. This work tackles the subset selection problem: selecting a small set of the most informative examples from a large unlabeled pool for annotation. We propose a simple and effective method that combines feature norms, randomization, and orthogonality (via the Gram-Schmidt process) to select diverse and informative samples. Feature norms serve as a proxy for informativeness, while randomization and orthogonalization reduce redundancy and encourage coverage of the feature space. Extensive experiments on image and text benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, OrganAMNIST, and Yelp, show that our method consistently improves subset selection performance, both as a standalone approach and when integrated with existing techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be improved by aligning with human preferences through fine-tuning -- the so-called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive for many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time tokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been proposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial sequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences with high rewards. However, these methods have so far been only heuristically motivated and poorly analyzed. In this work, we show that reward models trained on full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences. To alleviate this, we propose to train a Bradley-Terry reward model on partial sequences explicitly, and autoregressively sample from the implied tokenwise policy during decoding. We study the properties of this reward model and the resulting policy: we show that this policy is proportional to the ratio of two distinct RLHF policies. Our simple approach outperforms previous RGTG methods and performs similarly to strong offline baselines without large-scale LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Formal verification has emerged as a promising method to ensure the safety and reliability of neural networks. However, many relevant properties, such as fairness or global robustness, pertain to the entire input space. If one applies verification techniques naively, the neural network is checked even on inputs that do not occur in the real world and have no meaning. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose the VeriFlow architecture as a flow-based density model tailored to allow any verification approach to restrict its search to some data distribution of interest. We argue that our architecture is particularly well suited for this purpose because of two major properties. First, we show that the transformation that is defined by our model is piecewise affine. Therefore, the model allows the usage of verifiers based on constraint solving with linear arithmetic. Second, upper density level sets (UDL) of the data distribution are definable via linear constraints in the latent space. As a consequence, representations of UDLs specified by a given probability are effectively computable in the latent space. This property allows for effective verification with a fine-grained, probabilistically interpretable control of how a-typical the inputs subject to verification are.

Abstract: This study compared the performance of classical feature-based machine learning models (CMLs) and large language models (LLMs) in predicting COVID-19 mortality using high-dimensional tabular data from 9,134 patients across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were evaluated alongside eight LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Mistral-7b, which performed zero-shot classification on text-converted structured data. Additionally, Mistral- 7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach. XGBoost and RF demonstrated superior performance among CMLs, achieving F1 scores of 0.87 and 0.83 for internal and external validation, respectively. GPT-4 led the LLM category with an F1 score of 0.43, while fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, yielding a stable F1 score of 0.74 during external validation. Although LLMs showed moderate performance in zero-shot classification, fine-tuning substantially enhanced their effectiveness, potentially bridging the gap with CML models. However, CMLs still outperformed LLMs in handling high-dimensional tabular data tasks. This study highlights the potential of both CMLs and fine-tuned LLMs in medical predictive modeling, while emphasizing the current superiority of CMLs for structured data analysis.

However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In quantitative disciplines concepts are typically formulated as equations. Hence, in order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. Computationally, this framework is based on finding a symbolic expression whose normalized gradients match the normalized gradients of a specific neuron with respect to the input variables. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.

Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have demonstrated significant potential in graph classification by emulating brain-inspired neural dynamics to achieve energy-efficient computation. However, existing SGNs are generally constrained to in-distribution scenarios and struggle with distribution shifts. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-Consicious Spiking Graph for Cross-Domain Adaptation (DeSGraDA). DeSGraDA enhances generalization across domains with three key components. First, we introduce the degree-conscious spiking representation module by adapting spike thresholds based on node degrees, enabling more expressive and structure-aware signal encoding. Then, we perform temporal distribution alignment by adversarially matching membrane potentials between domains, ensuring effective performance under domain shift while preserving energy efficiency. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Furthermore, we establish the first generalization bound for SGDA, providing theoretical insights into its adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that DeSGraDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification accuracy and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "concept unlearning" with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4 and Stable Diffusion v2.1. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.

<title>Capacity-Aware Planning and Scheduling in Budget-Constrained Multi-Agent MDPs: A Meta-RL Approach</title>

Abstract: We study capacity- and budget-constrained multi-agent MDPs (CB-MA-MDPs), a class that captures many maintenance and scheduling tasks in which each agent can irreversibly fail and a planner must decide (i) when to apply a restorative action and (ii) which subset of agents to treat in parallel. The global budget limits the total number of restorations, while the capacity constraint bounds the number of simultaneous actions, turning na\"ive dynamic programming into a combinatorial search that scales exponentially with the number of agents. We propose a two-stage solution that remains tractable for large systems. First, a Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP)-based grouping partitions the agents into r disjoint sets (r = capacity) that maximise diversity in expected time-to-failure, allocating budget to each set proportionally. Second, a meta-trained PPO policy solves each sub-MDP, leveraging transfer across groups to converge rapidly. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of scheduling repairs for a large team of industrial robots, constrained by a limited number of repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing the average uptime of the robot team, particularly for large team sizes. Lastly, we confirm the scalability of our approach through a computational complexity analysis across varying numbers of robots and repair technicians.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Rare-to-Frequent.

Abstract: Gender-based violence is a pervasive public health issue that severely impacts women's mental health, often leading to conditions such as in anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse. Identifying the combination of these various mental health conditions could then point to someone who is a victim of gender-based violence. And while speech-based artificial intelligence tools show as a promising solution for mental health screening, their performance often deteriorates when encountering speech from previously unseen speakers, a sign that speaker traits may be confounding factors. This study introduces a speaker-agnostic approach to detecting the gender-based violence victim condition from speech, aiming to develop robust artificial intelligence models capable of generalizing across speakers. By employing domain-adversarial training, we reduce the influence of speaker identity on model predictions, we achieve a 26.95% relative reduction in speaker identification accuracy while improving gender-based violence victim condition classification accuracy by 6.37% (relative). These results suggest that our models effectively capture paralinguistic biomarkers linked to the gender-based violence victim condition, rather than speaker-specific traits. Additionally, the model's predictions show moderate correlation with pre-clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, supporting the relevance of speech as a non-invasive tool for mental health monitoring. This work lays the foundation for ethical, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence systems to support clinical screening of gender-based violence survivors.

<title>How Strategic Agents Respond: Comparing Analytical Models with LLM-Generated Responses in Strategic Classification</title>

Abstract: When ML algorithms are deployed to automate human-related decisions, human agents may learn the underlying decision policies and adapt their behavior. Strategic Classification (SC) has emerged as a framework for studying this interaction between agents and decision-makers to design more trustworthy ML systems. Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly or approximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing their utility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility that real-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. This shift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and socially responsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical models accurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? To investigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions on effort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors with the best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Even without access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategies that improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the population level, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higher score improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as those predicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical model may still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) At the individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effort allocations than theoretical models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) bandits provide a powerful framework for performing blackbox optimization of unknown functions. The characteristics of the unknown function depends heavily on the assumed GP prior. Most work in the literature assume that this prior is known but in practice this seldom holds. Instead, practitioners often rely on maximum likelihood estimation to select the hyperparameters of the prior - which lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose two algorithms for joint prior selection and regret minimization in GP bandits based on GP Thompson sampling (GP-TS): Prior-Elimination GP-TS (PE-GP-TS) and HyperPrior GP-TS (HP-GP-TS). We theoretically analyze the algorithms and establish upper bounds for their respective regret. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to the alternatives through experiments with synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning benchmarks with 10% of its training data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.

Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space}, the natural domain for periodic crystals, and construct a Fourier series representation from fractional coordinates and reciprocal lattice vectors with learnable filters. Building on this principle, we introduce the reciprocal space-based geometry network (\textbf{ReciNet}), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReciNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension to multi-property prediction with the mixture-of-experts, which demonstrates high computational efficiency and reveals positive transfer between correlated properties. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction.

Abstract: We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with a particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to "work". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. We connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic to help predict the success or failure of new compositions.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely adopted for its ability to simultaneously learn multiple tasks. While existing gradient manipulation methods often yield more balanced solutions than simple scalarization-based approaches, they typically incur a significant computational overhead of $\mathcal{O}(K)$ in both time and memory, where $K$ is the number of tasks. In this paper, we propose LDC-MTL, a simple and scalable loss discrepancy control approach for MTL, formulated from a bilevel optimization perspective. Our method incorporates two key components: (i) a bilevel formulation for fine-grained loss discrepancy control, and (ii) a scalable first-order bilevel algorithm that requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and memory. Theoretically, we prove that LDC-MTL guarantees convergence not only to a stationary point of the bilevel problem with loss discrepancy control but also to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point for all $K$ loss functions under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-task datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LDC-MTL in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: As a data-driven approach, offline MARL learns superior policies solely from offline datasets, ideal for domains rich in historical data but with high interaction costs and risks. However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a task-efficient value-based multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing methods decoding actions from skills via behavior cloning, SD-CQL discovers skills in a latent space by reconstructing the next observation, evaluates fixed and variable actions separately, and uses conservative Q-learning with local value calibration to select the optimal action for each skill. It eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited, small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraft II demonstrate the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{13}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{68.9%}$ improvement on individual task sets.

Abstract: Structured data, such as graphs, is vital in machine learning due to its capacity to capture complex relationships and interactions. In recent years, the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance has attracted growing interest because it enables the comparison of structured data by jointly accounting for feature similarity and geometric structure. However, as a variant of optimal transport (OT), classical FGW assumes an equal mass constraint on the compared data. In this work, we relax this mass constraint and propose the Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (FPGW) framework, which extends FGW to accommodate unbalanced data. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between FPGW and FGW and prove the metric properties of FPGW. Numerically, we introduce Frank-Wolfe solvers and Sinkhorn solvers for the proposed FPGW framework. Finally, we evaluate the FPGW distance through graph matching, graph classification and graph clustering experiments, demonstrating its robust performance.

Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by 14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

Abstract: Causal discovery is a difficult problem that typically relies on strong assumptions on the data-generating model, such as non-Gaussianity. In practice, many modern applications provide multiple related views of the same system, which has rarely been considered for causal discovery. Here, we leverage this multi-view structure to achieve causal discovery with weak assumptions. We propose a multi-view linear Structural Equation Model (SEM) that extends the well-known framework of non-Gaussian disturbances by alternatively leveraging correlation over views. We prove the identifiability of the model for acyclic SEMs. Subsequently, we propose several multi-view causal discovery algorithms, inspired by single-view algorithms (DirectLiNGAM, PairwiseLiNGAM, and ICA-LiNGAM). The new methods are validated through simulations and applications on neuroimaging data, where they enable the estimation of causal graphs between brain regions.

Abstract: In contrast to the assumptions of most existing Electromigration (EM) analysis tools, the evolution of EM-induced stress is inherently non-deterministic, influenced by factors such as input current fluctuations and manufacturing non-idealities. Traditional approaches for estimating stress variations typically involve computationally expensive and inefficient Monte Carlo simulations with industrial solvers, which quantify variations using mean and variance metrics. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning-based framework, termed BPINN-EM- Post, for efficient stochastic analysis of EM-induced post-voiding aging processes. For the first time, our new approach integrates closed-form analytical solutions with a Bayesian Physics- Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework to accelerate the analysis. The closed-form solutions enforce physical laws at the individual wire segment level, while the BPINN ensures that physics constraints at inter-segment junctions are satisfied and stochastic behaviors are accurately modeled. By reducing the number of variables in the loss functions through utilizing analytical solutions, our method significantly improves training efficiency without accuracy loss and naturally incorporates variational effects. Additionally, the analytical solutions effectively address the challenge of incorporating initial stress distributions in interconnect structures during post-void stress calculations. Numerical results demonstrate that BPINN-EM-Post achieves over 240x and more than 67x speedup compared to Monte Carlo simulations using the FEM-based COMSOL solver and FDM-based EMSpice, respectively, with marginal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Imputation of random or non-random missing data is a long-standing research topic and a crucial application for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, with the advent of modern communication technologies such as Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS), traffic data collection has introduced new challenges in random missing value imputation and increasing demands for spatiotemporal dependency modelings. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal traffic imputation method based on a Multimode Nonlinear Transformed Tensor Nuclear Norm (MNT-TNN), which can effectively capture the intrinsic multimode spatiotemporal correlations and low-rankness of the traffic tensor, represented as location $\times$ location $\times$ time. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. We also suggest an Augmented Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm Families (ATTNNs) framework to enhance the imputation results of TTNN techniques, especially at very high miss rates. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed MNT-TNN and ATTNNs can outperform the compared state-of-the-art imputation methods, completing the benchmark of random missing traffic value imputation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding how diffusion models can learn disentangled representations. Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art researches indicate that analytic algorithms are promising in handling complex floorplanning scenarios. However, it is challenging to generate compact floorplans with excellent wirelength optimization effect due to the local convergence of gradient-based optimization algorithms designed for constructed smooth optimization models. Accordingly, we propose to construct a nonsmooth analytic floorplanning model addressed by the conjugate subgradient algorithm (CSA), which is accelerated by a population-based scheme adaptively regulating the stepsize with the assistance of Q-learning. In this way, the proposed CSA assisted by Q-learning (CSAQ) can strike a good balance on exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on the MCNC and GSRC benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed fixed-outline floorplanning algorithm based on CSAQ (CSF) not only address global floorplanning effectively, but also get legal floorplans more efficiently than the constraint graph-based legalization algorithm as well as its improved variants. It is also demonstrated that the CSF is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms on floorplanning scenarios only containing hard modules.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

<title>Sparsity Forcing: Reinforcing Token Sparsity of MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.

Abstract: Advances in neural operators have introduced discretization invariant surrogate models for PDEs on general geometries, yet many approaches struggle to encode local geometric structure and variable domains efficiently. We introduce enf2enf, a neural field approach for predicting steady-state PDEs with geometric variability. Our method encodes geometries into latent features anchored at specific spatial locations, preserving locality throughout the network. These local representations are combined with global parameters and decoded to continuous physical fields, enabling effective modeling of complex shape variations. Experiments on aerodynamic and structural benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to graph-based, neural operator, and recent neural field methods, with real-time inference and efficient scaling to high-resolution meshes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches, allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover, our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) as foundation models have significantly enhanced performance across a wide range of visual and textual tasks, without requiring large-scale training from scratch for downstream tasks. However, these deterministic VLMs fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language and visual data. Recent probabilistic post-hoc adaptation methods address this by mapping deterministic embeddings onto probability distributions; however, existing approaches do not account for the asymmetric uncertainty structure of the modalities, and the constraint that meaningful deterministic embeddings reside on a unit hypersphere, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the asymmetric uncertainty structure inherent in textual and visual data, and propose AsymVLM to build probabilistic embeddings from pre-trained VLMs on the unit hypersphere, enabling uncertainty quantification. We validate the effectiveness of the probabilistic embeddings on established benchmarks, and present comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating the inherent nature of asymmetry in the uncertainty structure of textual and visual data.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid growth of model parameters, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become essential for adapting large models to diverse downstream tasks under constrained computational resources. Within this paradigm, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants preserve semantic representations of pre-trained models, but struggle to achieve both expressiveness and efficiency in terms of parameter counts, memory, and computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning with Principal Subspace adaptation (PSOFT), which confines orthogonal transformations to the principal subspace of pre-trained weights. Specifically, PSOFT constructs this subspace via matrix decomposition to enable compatible transformations with higher effective rank, establishes a theoretical condition that strictly maintains the geometry of this subspace for essential semantic preservation, and introduces efficient tunable vectors that gradually relax orthogonality during training to enhance adaptability. Extensive experiments on 35 NLP and CV tasks across four representative models demonstrate that PSOFT offers a practical and scalable solution to simultaneously achieve semantic preservation, expressiveness, and multi-dimensional efficiency in PEFT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/fei407/PSOFT.

<title>Quantization Meets Reasoning: Exploring and Mitigating Degradation of Low-Bit LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) that enables LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their responses in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation during LLM decoding to generate predictive distributions for token-level uncertainty estimation, and we aggregate these uncertainty quantities to capture the semantic uncertainty of generated responses. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that TokUR exhibits a strong correlation with answer correctness and model robustness, and the uncertainty signals produced by TokUR can be leveraged to enhance the model's reasoning performance at test time. These results highlight the effectiveness of TokUR as a principled and scalable approach for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks.

<title>Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Importantly, our work shows that SAE width is not a neutral hyperparameter: narrower SAEs suffer more from hedging than wider SAEs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement.

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. Interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, we propose that invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured relational representations of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.

Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning -- empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth -- have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training. In this work, we describe a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics: we identify two novel \textit{dynamical} scaling laws that govern how performance evolves as function of different norm-based complexity measures. Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a single-layer perceptron trained with logistic loss, where we derive the new dynamical scaling laws, and we explain them through the implicit bias induced by gradient-based training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like (Low-Rank Adaptation) LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, to our knowledge the first method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates training as a minimax optimization over low-rank adapters and adversarial perturbations, enabling robust adaptation with a small trainable footprint. Across eight datasets and two backbones (ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32), AdvCLIP-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification, adversarial base-to-new generalization, and cross-dataset transfer, delivering higher adversarial robustness than prompt tuning baselines without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image restoration tasks. Its general applicability on image-conditioned generation is also demonstrated via qualitative results on image-to-image translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/FoD.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. Recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine within the Muon algorithm for training deep neural networks. However, the requirements of this application differ sharply from classical settings: deep learning demands GPU-friendly algorithms that prioritize high throughput over high precision. We introduce Polar Express, a new method for computing the polar decomposition. Like Newton-Schulz and other classical polynomial methods, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it very efficient on GPUs. Inspired by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem. We prove that this strategy minimizes error in a worst-case sense, allowing Polar Express to converge as rapidly as possible both in the early iterations and asymptotically. We also address finite-precision issues, making it practical to use in bfloat16. When integrated into the Muon training framework, our method leads to consistent improvements in validation loss when training a GPT-2 model on one billion tokens from the FineWeb dataset, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: We present SPAR, a framework for self-supervised placement-aware representation learning in distributed sensing. Distributed sensing spans applications where multiple spatially distributed and multimodal sensors jointly observe an environment, from vehicle monitoring to human activity recognition and earthquake localization. A central challenge shared by this wide spectrum of applications, is that observed signals are inseparably shaped by sensor placements, including their spatial locations and structural roles. However, existing pretraining methods remain largely placement-agnostic. SPAR addresses this gap through a unifying principle: the duality between signals and positions. Guided by this principle, SPAR introduces spatial and structural positional embeddings together with dual reconstruction objectives, explicitly modeling how observing positions and observed signals shape each other. Placement is thus treated not as auxiliary metadata but as intrinsic to representation learning. SPAR is theoretically supported by analyses from information theory and occlusion-invariant learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SPAR achieves superior robustness and generalization across various modalities, placements, and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Transformer LLMs have been shown to exhibit strong reasoning ability that scales with inference-time compute, most prominently through token-space "thinking" chains of thought. A growing line of work pushes extra computation into the model's latent space, which we term Auxiliary Latent-Space Computation (ALSC). Existing ALSC methods largely fall into three buckets: (i) token-mediated latent rollouts, (ii) residual/activation steering, and (iii) memory (KV) compression. An underexplored alternative is memory consolidation/reconsolidation, two processes in the brain that are responsible for stabilising newly formed memory traces, and, upon recall, transiently rendering established traces plastic such they can integrate new contextual information before restabilising. In Transformer LLMs, this can be seen as analogous to performing in-place rewrites of new KV segments, and rewrites of recalled past segments. In this work, we give a theoretical justification as to why memory (re)consolidation via KV cache rewrites is beneficial for improved reasoning. We do this through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input information compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We then introduce the Bottlenecked Transformer, which augments a backbone LLM with a Cache Processor, an auxiliary Transformer that performs periodic, non-causal, in-place KV rewrites at newline-delimited reasoning step boundaries. The Processor consolidates recently written KV entries and reconsolidates a small, top-k attention-selected set of prior entries. We evaluate our Bottlenecked Transformer architecture on math reasoning benchmarks. Our model sees consistent performance gains over vanilla Transformers and pause-token augmented baselines, with gains of up to +6.6pp for selected tasks/backbones.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.

<title>Can LLMs Alleviate Catastrophic Forgetting in Graph Continual Learning? A Systematic Study</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhixunLEE/LLM4GCL.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers broader insights, such approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all these perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to realistic settings like AdamW. We empirically validate that a CNN and a Transformer are accurately replicated by this reformulation. Second, we derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature maps. Their effectiveness for parameter pruning is comparable to existing methods, demonstrating their value for model component attribution. Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking. Our findings support previously proposed stages of Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded, unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.

Abstract: While the performance of machine learning systems has experienced significant improvement in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the fundamental question: to what extent can we improve our models? This paper provides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary classification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a previous work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the optimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate the properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the original work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how well the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay significantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard labels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem setting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use calibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that calibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft labels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that isotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an assumption weaker than that of the previous work. Our method is instance-free, i.e., we do not assume access to any input instances. This feature allows it to be adopted in practical scenarios where the instances are not available due to privacy issues. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the validity of our methods and theory.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics from limited data with unknown physics is challenging. Existing neural PDE solvers either require large datasets or rely on known physics (e.g., PDE residuals or handcrafted stencils), leading to limited applicability. To address these challenges, we propose Spectral-Inspired Neural Operator (SINO), which can model complex systems from just 2-5 trajectories, without requiring explicit PDE terms. Specifically, SINO automatically captures both local and global spatial derivatives from frequency indices, enabling a compact representation of the underlying differential operators in physics-agnostic regimes. To model nonlinear effects, it employs a Pi-block that performs multiplicative operations on spectral features, complemented by a low-pass filter to suppress aliasing. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks demonstrate that SINO achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of 1-2 orders of magnitude in accuracy. Particularly, with only 5 training trajectories, SINO outperforms data-driven methods trained on 1000 trajectories and remains predictive on challenging out-of-distribution cases where other methods fail.

Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&amp;M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

Abstract: The goal of quantization is to produce a compressed model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as possible. To do this tractably, most quantization algorithms minimize the immediate activation error of each layer as a proxy for the end-to-end error. However, this ignores the effect of future layers, making it a poor proxy. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that directly considers the error at the network's output. YAQA introduces a series of theoretical results that culminate in the first end-to-end error bounds for quantization algorithms. First, we characterize the convergence time of adaptive rounding algorithms via the structure of their Hessian approximations. We then show that the end-to-end error can be bounded by the approximation's cosine similarity to the true Hessian. This admits a natural Kronecker-factored approximation with corresponding near-optimal Hessian sketches. YAQA is provably better than GPTQ/LDLQ and empirically reduces the error by $\approx 30\%$ over these methods. YAQA even achieves a lower error than quantization aware training. This translates to state of the art performance on downstream tasks, all while adding no inference overhead.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms solve TN-SS as a purely numerical optimization problem and require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore the valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Conventional approaches, such as reservoir computing, typically require training data that incorporates long-term continuous dynamical behavior to comprehensively capture system dynamics. While advanced deep sequence models can capture transient dynamics within the training data, they often struggle to maintain predictive stability and dynamical coherence over extended horizons. Here, we propose PhyxMamba, a framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed principles to forecast long-term behavior of chaotic systems given short-term historical observations on their state evolution. We first reconstruct the attractor manifold with time-delay embeddings to extract global dynamical features. After that, we introduce a generative training scheme that enables Mamba to replicate the physical process. It is further augmented by multi-patch prediction and attractor geometry regularization for physical constraints, enhancing predictive accuracy and preserving key statistical properties of systems. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers superior forecasting accuracy and faithfully captures essential statistics from short-term historical observations.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: GCN-based traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor cross-scale generalization for TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a Subgraph-Based Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges, we design the subgraph-based rescaling to normalize edge lengths of subgraphs. Under a unified subgraph perspective, RsGCN can efficiently learn scale-generalizable representations from small-scale TSPs at low cost. To exploit and assess the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design a Reconstruction-Based Search (RBS), in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and RBS, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on a mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our advanced performance across uniform-distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values. We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa, BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in almost all cases.

Abstract: Quite recently, large language models have made a significant breakthrough across various disciplines. However, training them is an extremely resource-intensive task, even for major players with vast computing resources. One of the methods gaining popularity in light of these challenges is Sign-SGD. This method can be applied both as a memory-efficient approach in single-node training and as a gradient compression technique in the distributed learning. Nevertheless, it is impossible to automatically determine the effective stepsize from the theoretical standpoint. Indeed, it depends on the parameters of the dataset to which we do not have access in the real-world learning paradigm. To address this issue, we design several variants of single-node deterministic Sign-SGD. We extend our approaches to practical scenarios: stochastic single-node and multi-node learning, methods with incorporated momentum. We conduct extensive experiments on real machine learning problems that emphasize the practical applicability of our ideas.

By enforcing orthogonality between gradient updates and weight vectors, $\perp$Grad alters optimization trajectories without architectural changes. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy while achieving statistically significant improvements in test loss ($p=0.05$), predictive entropy ($p=0.001$), and confidence measures. These effects show consistent trends across corruption levels and architectures. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal overhead, and remains compatible with post-hoc calibration techniques.
  Theoretically, we characterize convergence and stationary points for a simplified $\perp$Grad variant, revealing that orthogonalization constrains loss reduction pathways to avoid confidence inflation and encourage decision-boundary improvements. Our findings suggest that geometric interventions in optimization can improve predictive uncertainty estimates at low computational cost.

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph learning. Typical efforts enhance MPGNN's expressive power by enriching the adjacency-based aggregation. In contrast, we introduce an efficient aggregation over walk incidence-based matrices that are constructed to deliberately trade off some expressivity for stronger and more structured inductive bias. Our approach allows for seamless scaling between classical message-passing and simpler methods based on walks. We rigorously characterize the expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts over a hierarchy of generalized caterpillar graphs. Based on this foundation, we propose Caterpillar GNNs, whose robust graph-level aggregation successfully tackles a benchmark specifically designed to challenge MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on real-world datasets, Caterpillar GNNs achieve comparable predictive performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden layers of the computational graph.

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we propose a full-parameter pre-training and fine-tuning framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), enhanced with engineering optimizations, to enable efficient training of large-scale models on cost-effective RTX 4090, A100 and A800 GPU clusters. Under identical hardware configurations, we reduce the training cost of a 7B model to 33% on A100/A800 and only 2.6% on RTX 4090, compared to standard full-parameter training. It also enables large models previously restricted to A100 clusters to be trained on RTX 4090 without degrading performance. BCD achieves comparable or better accuracy than full-parameter and fine-tuning methods at most cases, with lower GPU consumption and improved hardware utilization.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in Large Language Models by leveraging their internal representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions. However, these monitors may themselves become training signals, for example, by using problematic samples found in deployment to retrain models. This raises an important question: can models learn to evade such monitors? To evaluate this capability, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to evade latent-space monitors while maintaining their blackbox behaviour. We apply RL-Obfuscation to Language Models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate their Evasion Success Rate against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack while more holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, for these vulnerable monitors, models trained to evade a single static monitor can generalise to evade other unseen monitors. We also find that the models can be trained to conditionally bypass latent-space monitors on only certain inputs. Finally, we study how the models bypass these monitors and find that the model can learn to repurpose tokens to have different internal representations.

<title>SecP-Tuning: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models via MPC</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance remains constrained due to the scarcity of accessible training data caused by stringent privacy requirements. Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning provides theoretical guarantees for the privacy of model parameters and data. However, its application to LLMs has been predominantly limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant efficiency challenges, particularly in backward propagation, optimizer, and self-attention operations. To address these challenges, we propose SecP-Tuning, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving prompt tuning of LLMs. SecP-Tuning innovatively integrates Forward-only Tuning (FoT) through the ``data owner-server interaction" paradigm, effectively removing the need for privacy-preserving computations in backward propagation and optimization processes. Furthermore, it devises an efficient privacy-preserving Random Feature Attention (RFA), effectively mitigating the computational complexity of softmax-based self-attention and circumventing MPC-incompatible nonlinear operations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to full-Parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and gradient-based prompt tuning, SecP-Tuning achieves approximately 12 times and 16 times end-to-end acceleration, as well as 18 times and 20 times reductions in communication overhead, respectively. Moreover, in five few-shot tasks, it achieves an average performance score of 82.45, outperforming SFT's 79.90 and prompt tuning's 73.73. Additionally, the ``black-box/API-style" privacy-preserving tuning paradigm of SecP-Tuning effectively avoids memory leakage risks caused by gradient/parameter transmission.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they must infer latent concepts from demonstration examples. This raises the question of whether and how transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation. Our work experiments with several controlled tasks, studying this question using mechanistic interpretability. First, we show that in transitive reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. This builds upon prior work that analyzes single-step reasoning. Then, we consider tasks parameterized by a latent numerical concept. We discover low-dimensional subspaces in the model's representation space, where the geometry cleanly reflects the underlying parameterization. Overall, we show that small and large models can indeed disentangle and utilize latent concepts that they learn in-context from a handful of abbreviated demonstrations.

Abstract: Online multi-agent control problems, where many agents pursue competing and time-varying objectives, are widespread in domains such as autonomous robotics, economics, and energy systems. In these settings, robustness to adversarial disturbances is critical. In this paper, we study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems subject to such disturbances. In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, which typically assumes noiseless or stochastically perturbed dynamics, we consider an online setting where disturbances can be adversarial, and where each agent seeks to minimize its own sequence of convex losses. Under two feedback models, we analyze online gradient-based controllers with local policy updates. We prove per-agent regret bounds that are sublinear and near-optimal in the time horizon and that highlight different scalings with the number of agents. When agents' objectives are aligned, we further show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying potential game for which we derive equilibrium tracking guarantees. Together, our results take a first step in bridging online control with online learning in games, establishing robust individual and collective performance guarantees in dynamic continuous-state environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL), especially when clients differ not only in distribution but also in the reliability of their predictions across individual examples. While personalized FL (PFL) aims to address this, we observe that many PFL methods fail to outperform two necessary baselines, local training and centralized training. This suggests that meaningful personalization only emerges in a narrow regime, where global models are insufficient, but collaboration across clients still holds value. Our empirical findings point to two key ingredients for success in this regime: adaptivity in collaboration and fine-grained trust, at the level of individual examples. We show that these properties can be achieved within federated semi-supervised learning, where clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This enables each client to align with public consensus when it is helpful, and disregard it when it is not, without sharing model parameters or raw data. As a concrete realization of this idea, we develop FEDMOSAIC, a personalized co-training method where clients reweight their loss and their contribution to pseudo-labels based on per-example agreement and confidence. FEDMOSAIC outperforms strong FL and PFL baselines across a range of non-IID settings, and we prove convergence under standard smoothness, bounded-variance, and drift assumptions. In contrast to many of these baselines, it also outperforms local and centralized training. These results clarify when federated personalization can be effective, and how fine-grained, trust-aware collaboration enables it.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation--diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.

Abstract: Score-function based methods for policy learning, such as REINFORCE and PPO, have delivered strong results in game-playing and robotics, yet their high variance often undermines training stability. Using pathwise policy gradients, i.e. computing a derivative by differentiating the objective function, alleviates the variance issues. However, they require an accurate action-conditioned value function, which is notoriously hard to learn without relying on replay buffers for reusing past off-policy data. We present an on-policy algorithm that trains Q-value models purely from on-policy trajectories, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to combine stochastic policies for exploration with constrained updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that stabilize value function learning. The result, Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), is an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the stability of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. Compared to state-of-the-art on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks, REPPO provides strong empirical performance at superior sample efficiency, wall-clock time, memory footprint, and hyperparameter robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs highlight RLVR as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of the common practice of RLVR. We examine how, under current training conditions, RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while the current RLVR recipe reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while the current RLVR recipe consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy - resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step - answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of the current RLVR recipe in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms for learning surrogate models of high-dim. multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dim. space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dim. space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. With this "embed->learn in latent space->lift back to ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use SFM to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations. Notably, linear MVAR models surpass nonlinear LSTMs in predictive accuracy, while also offering significantly lower complexity and greater interpretability.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among dissimilar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial generalization mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that ERIS achieves a statistically significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, consistently securing the top performance rank.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy sources such as solar panels and battery storage poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The energy injected from the BTM sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decrease in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification. Using a Transformer-based architecture that integrates sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies, DualNILM effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. Extensive evaluation on self-collected and synthesized datasets demonstrates that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods. Our work underscores the framework's potential for robust energy disaggregation in modern energy systems with renewable penetration. Synthetic photovoltaic augmented datasets with realistic injection simulation methodology will be open-sourced after review.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges arising from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals across diverse clinical configurations, often resulting in poor generalization. In this work, we propose SleepDIFFormer, a multi-channel differential transformer framework for heterogeneous EEG-EOG representation learning. SleepDIFFormer is trained across multiple sleep staging datasets, each treated as a source domain, with the goal of generalizing to unseen target domains. Specifically, it employs a Multi-channel Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) designed to process raw EEG and EOG signals while incorporating cross-domain alignment. Our approach mitigates spatial and temporal attention noise and learns a domain-invariant EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment across datasets, thereby enhancing generalization to new domains. Empirically, we evaluated SleepDIFFormer on five diverse sleep staging datasets under domain generalization settings and benchmarked it against existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We further conducted a comprehensive ablation study and interpreted the differential attention weights, demonstrating their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings advance the development of automated sleep stage classification and highlight its potential in quantifying sleep architecture and detecting abnormalities that disrupt restorative rest. Our source code and checkpoint are made publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.

<title>In-Context Algorithm Emulation in Fixed-Weight Transformers</title>

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer with frozen weights emulates a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. We formalize two modes of in-context algorithm emulation. In the task-specific mode, for any continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, we show the existence of a single-head softmax attention layer whose forward pass reproduces functions of the form $f(w^\top x - y)$ to arbitrary precision. This general template subsumes many popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, linear regression, ridge regression). In the prompt-programmable mode, we prove universality: a single fixed-weight two-layer softmax attention module emulates all algorithms from the task-specific class (i.e., each implementable by a single softmax attention) via only prompting. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All adaptation happens through the prompt alone. Numerical results corroborate our theory. These findings forge a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms via prompts alone, and establish a form of algorithmic universality in modern Transformer models.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable effective decision-making over long timescales. Existing approaches, while promising, have yet to realize the benefits of large-scale training. In this work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling online hierarchical RL to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a ~35x higher throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. To demonstrate SOL's performance and scalability, we train hierarchical agents using 30 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack, significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends. We also validate SOL on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at: github.com/facebookresearch/sol.

<title>Challenges in Non-Polymeric Crystal Structure Prediction: Why a Geometric, Permutation-Invariant Loss is Needed</title>

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular assembly problem, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques, the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques, on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions) Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant, we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.

Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size. Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption. These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in Optimization, Game Theory, and the training of Generative Adversarial Networks, the convergence properties of first order methods in min-max problems have received extensive study. It has been recognized that they may cycle, and there is no good understanding of their limit points when they do not. When they converge, do they converge to local min-max solutions? We characterize the limit points of two basic first order methods, namely Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA) and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA). We show that both dynamics avoid unstable critical points for almost all initializations. Moreover, for small step sizes and under mild assumptions, the set of \{OGDA\}-stable critical points is a superset of \{GDA\}-stable critical points, which is a superset of local min-max solutions (strict in some cases). The connecting thread is that the behavior of these dynamics can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective.

Abstract: Radiologists interpret mammography exams by jointly analyzing all four views, as correlations among them are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Recent methods employ dedicated fusion blocks to capture such dependencies, but these are often hindered by view dominance, training instability, and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce multi-view hypercomplex learning, a novel learning paradigm for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs). Thanks to hypercomplex algebra, our models intrinsically capture both intra- and inter-view relations. We propose PHResNets for two-view exams and two complementary four-view architectures: PHYBOnet, optimized for efficiency, and PHYSEnet, optimized for accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view models, while also generalizing across radiographic modalities and tasks such as disease classification from chest X-rays and multimodal brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Binary code analysis and comprehension is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. Unfortunately, unlike source code, binary code lacks semantics and is more difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. In this paper, we present ContraBin, a contrastive learning technique that integrates source code and comment information along with binaries to create an embedding capable of aiding binary analysis and comprehension tasks. Specifically, we present three components in ContraBin: (1) a primary contrastive learning method for initial pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to integrate source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation learning algorithm to train a binary code embedding. We further analyze the impact of human-written and synthetic comments on binary code comprehension tasks, revealing a significant performance disparity. While synthetic comments provide substantial benefits, human-written comments are found to introduce noise, even resulting in performance drops compared to using no comments. These findings reshape the narrative around the role of comment types in binary code analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of ContraBin through four indicative downstream tasks related to binary code: algorithmic functionality classification, function name recovery, code summarization, and reverse engineering. The results show that ContraBin considerably improves performance on all four tasks, measured by accuracy, mean of average precision, and BLEU scores as appropriate. ContraBin is the first language representation model to incorporate source code, binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and is intended to contribute to the field of binary code analysis. The dataset used in this study is available for further research.

Abstract: Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct mapping from features to optimal decisions. We establish the nonasymptotic consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to (composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.

Abstract: In the realm of mobile edge computing (MEC), efficient computation task offloading plays a pivotal role in ensuring a seamless quality of experience (QoE) for users. Maintaining a high QoE is paramount in today's interconnected world, where users demand reliable services. This challenge stands as one of the most primary key factors contributing to handling dynamic and uncertain mobile environments. In this study, we delve into computation offloading in MEC systems, where strict task processing deadlines and energy constraints can adversely affect the system performance. We formulate the computation task offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the long-term QoE of each user individually. We propose a distributed QoE-oriented computation offloading (QECO) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that empowers mobile devices to make their offloading decisions without requiring knowledge of decisions made by other devices. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the performance of QECO. Simulation results reveal that compared to the state-of-the-art existing works, QECO increases the number of completed tasks by up to 14.4%, while simultaneously reducing task delay and energy consumption by 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Together, these improvements result in a significant average QoE enhancement of 37.1%. This substantial improvement is achieved by accurately accounting for user dynamics and edge server workloads when making intelligent offloading decisions. This highlights QECO's effectiveness in enhancing users' experience in MEC systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performances, are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Although various defenses have been proposed, there is still substantial room for improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against MIAs by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs, which is exploited by MIAs, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense, called DIFFENCE, works pre inference, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time or post-inference time.
  A unique feature of DIFFENCE is that it works on input samples only, without modifying the training or inference phase of the target model. Therefore, it can be cascaded with other defense mechanisms as we demonstrate through experiments. DIFFENCE is designed to preserve the model's prediction labels for each sample, thereby not affecting accuracy. Furthermore, we have empirically demonstrated it does not reduce the usefulness of confidence vectors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that DIFFENCE can serve as a robust plug-n-play defense mechanism, enhancing membership privacy without compromising model utility. For instance, DIFFENCE reduces MIA accuracy against an undefended model by 15.8\% and attack AUC by 14.0\% on average across three datasets, all without impacting model utility. By integrating DIFFENCE with prior defenses, we can achieve new state-of-the-art performances in the privacy-utility trade-off. For example, when combined with the state-of-the-art SELENA defense it reduces attack accuracy by 9.3\%, and attack AUC by 10.0\%. DIFFENCE achieves this by imposing a negligible computation overhead, adding only 57ms to the inference time per sample processed on average.

<title>DoDo-Code: an Efficient Levenshtein Distance Embedding-based Code for 4-ary IDS Channel</title>

Abstract: With the emergence of new storage and communication methods, the insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) channel has attracted considerable attention. However, many topics on the IDS channel and the associated Levenshtein distance remain open, making the invention of a novel IDS-correcting code a hard task. Furthermore, current studies on single-IDS-correcting code misalign with the requirements of applications which necessitates the correcting of multiple errors. Compromise solutions have involved shortening codewords to reduce the chance of multiple errors. However, the code rates of existing codes are poor at short lengths, diminishing the overall storage density. In this study, a novel method is introduced for designing high-code-rate single-IDS-correcting codewords through deep Levenshtein distance embedding. A deep learning model is utilized to project the sequences into embedding vectors that preserve the Levenshtein distances between the original sequences. This embedding space serves as a proxy for the complex Levenshtein domain, within which algorithms for codeword search and segment correcting is developed. While the concept underpinning this approach is straightforward, it bypasses the mathematical challenges typically encountered in code design. The proposed method results in a code rate that outperforms existing combinatorial solutions, particularly for designing short-length codewords.

<title>Online Resource Allocation with Average Budget Constraints</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of online resource allocation with average budget constraints. At each time point the decision maker makes an irrevocable decision of whether to accept or reject a request before the next request arrives with the goal to maximize the cumulative rewards. In contrast to existing literature requiring the total resource consumption is below a certain level, we require the average resource consumption per accepted request does not exceed a given threshold. This problem can be casted as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment, and can find applications in various fields such as online anomaly detection, sequential advertising, and per-capita public service providers. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such a regret growing rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data of New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies.

<title>Discretization Error of Fourier Neural Operators</title>

arXiv:2405.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is a variant of machine learning that is designed to approximate maps between function spaces from data. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is one of the main model architectures used for operator learning. The FNO combines linear and nonlinear operations in physical space with linear operations in Fourier space, leading to a parameterized map acting between function spaces. Although in definition, FNOs are objects in continuous space and perform convolutions on a continuum, their implementation is a discretized object performing computations on a grid, allowing efficient implementation via the FFT. Thus, there is a discretization error between the continuum FNO definition and the discretized object used in practice that is separate from other previously analyzed sources of model error. We examine this discretization error here and obtain algebraic rates of convergence in terms of the grid resolution as a function of the input regularity. Numerical experiments that validate the theory and describe model stability are performed. In addition, an algorithm is presented that leverages the discretization error and model error decomposition to optimize computational training time.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.

<title>Leveraging Model Guidance to Extract Training Data from Personalized Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases. The code is available https://github.com/Nicholas0228/FineXtract.

<title>A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation for popular programming languages. However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets.
  Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation.
  We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.

<title>Stuffed Mamba: Oversized States Lead to the Inability to Forget</title>

arXiv:2410.07145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.

Abstract: Testing and validating Autonomous Vehicle (AV) performance in safety-critical and diverse scenarios is crucial before real-world deployment. However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.

<title>$100K or 100 Days: Trade-offs when Pre-Training with Academic Resources</title>

arXiv:2410.23261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training is notoriously compute-intensive and academic researchers are notoriously under-resourced. It is, therefore, commonly assumed that academics can't pre-train models. In this paper, we seek to clarify this assumption. We first survey academic researchers to learn about their available compute and then empirically measure the time to replicate models on such resources. We introduce a benchmark to measure the time to pre-train models on given GPUs and also identify ideal settings for maximizing training speed. We run our benchmark on a range of models and academic GPUs, spending 2,000 GPU-hours on our experiments. Our results reveal a brighter picture for academic pre-training: for example, although Pythia-1B was originally trained on 64 GPUs for 3 days, we find it is also possible to replicate this model (with the same hyper-parameters) in 3x fewer GPU-days: i.e. on 4 GPUs in 18 days. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis to help clarify the trade-offs between price and pre-training time. We believe our benchmark will help academic researchers conduct experiments that require training larger models on more data. We fully release our codebase at: https://github.com/apoorvkh/academic-pretraining.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of new chemical compounds is essential for advancing global health and developing treatments. While generative models show promise in creating novel molecules, challenges remain in ensuring the real-world applicability of these molecules and finding such molecules efficiently. To address this challenge, we introduce Conditional Latent Space Molecular Scaffold Optimization (CLaSMO), which integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) to strategically modify molecules while preserving similarity to the original input, effectively framing the task as constrained optimization. Our LSBO setting improves the sample-efficiency of the molecular optimization, and our modification approach helps us to obtain molecules with higher chances of real-world applicability. CLaSMO explores substructures of molecules in a sample-efficient manner by performing BO in the latent space of a CVAE conditioned on the atomic environment of the molecule to be optimized. Our extensive evaluations across diverse optimization tasks, including rediscovery, docking score, and multi-property optimization, show that CLaSMO efficiently enhances target properties, delivers remarkable sample-efficiency crucial for resource-limited applications while considering molecular similarity constraints, achieves state of the art performance, and maintains practical synthetic accessibility. We also provide an open-source web application that enables chemical experts to apply CLaSMO in a Human-in-the-Loop setting.

arXiv:2411.07102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address unconstrained finite-sum optimization problems, with particular focus on instances originating in large scale deep learning scenarios. Our main interest lies in the exploration of the relationship between recent line search approaches for stochastic optimization in the overparametrized regime and momentum directions. First, we point out that combining these two elements with computational benefits is not straightforward. To this aim, we propose a solution based on mini-batch persistency. We then introduce an algorithmic framework that exploits a mix of data persistency, conjugate-gradient type rules for the definition of the momentum parameter and stochastic line searches. The resulting algorithm provably possesses convergence properties under suitable assumptions and is empirically shown to outperform other popular methods from the literature, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both convex and nonconvex large scale training problems.

Abstract: Estimating the uncertainty of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization (TFB), a simple yet theoretically grounded framework that efficiently transforms trained low-rank adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. Our theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to KL-regularized variational optimization, a generalized form of variational inference. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex Bayesianization training procedures. Code will be available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/bayesian-peft.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

<title>IP$^{2}$-RSNN: Bi-level Intrinsic Plasticity Enables Learning-to-learn in Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Learning-to-learn (L2L), defined as progressively faster learning across similar tasks, is fundamental to both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, its neural basis remains elusive, as most studies emphasize neural population dynamics induced by synaptic plasticity while overlooking adaptations driven by intrinsic neuronal plasticity, which point-neuron models cannot capture. To address the above issue, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network with bi-level intrinsic plasticity (IP$^{2}$-RSNN). First, based on task demands, a slow meta-intrinsic plasticity determines which intrinsic neuronal properties are learnable, which is preserved throughout subsequent task learning once configured. Second, a fast intrinsic plasticity fine-tunes those learnable properties within each task. Our results indicate that the proposed bi-level intrinsic plasticity plays a critical role in enabling L2L in RSNNs and show that IP$^{2}$-RSNNs outperform point-neuron recurrent neural networks and self-attention models. Furthermore, our analysis of multi-scale neural dynamics reveals that the bi-level intrinsic plasticity is essential to task-type-specific adaptations at both the neuronal and network levels during L2L, while such adaptations cannot be captured by point-neuron models. Our results suggest that intrinsic plasticity provides significant computational advantages in L2L, shedding light on the design of brain-inspired deep learning models and algorithms.

Abstract: Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.

Abstract: Controllable image-to-video (I2V) generation transforms a reference image into a coherent video guided by user-specified control signals. In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: Language model evaluations often fail to characterize consequential failure modes, forcing experts to inspect outputs and build new benchmarks. We introduce task elicitation, a method that automatically builds new evaluations to profile model behavior. Task elicitation finds hundreds of natural-language tasks -- an order of magnitude more than prior work -- where frontier models exhibit systematic failures, in domains ranging from forecasting to online harassment. For example, we find that Sonnet 3.5 over-associates quantum computing and AGI and that o3-mini is prone to hallucination when fabrications are repeated in-context.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive surgical simulation has the potential to facilitate crucial applications, such as medical professional training and autonomous surgical agent training. In the natural visual domain, world models have enabled action-controlled data generation, demonstrating the potential to train autonomous agents in interactive simulated environments when large-scale real data acquisition is infeasible. However, such works in the surgical domain have been limited to simplified computer simulations, and lack realism. Furthermore, existing literature in world models has predominantly dealt with action-labeled data, limiting their applicability to real-world surgical data, where obtaining action annotation is prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the recent success of Genie in leveraging unlabeled video game data to infer latent actions and enable action-controlled data generation, we propose the first surgical vision world model. The proposed model can generate action-controllable surgical data and the architecture design is verified with extensive experiments on the unlabeled SurgToolLoc-2022 dataset.

Abstract: Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a widely adopted strategy for reducing the computational cost of attention layers in large language models (LLMs). However, current GQA configurations are often suboptimal because they overlook how context length influences inference cost. Since inference cost grows with context length, the most cost-efficient GQA configuration should also vary accordingly. In this work, we analyze the relationship among context length, model size, GQA configuration, and model loss, and introduce two innovations: (1) we decouple the total head size from the hidden size, enabling more flexible control over attention FLOPs; and (2) we jointly optimize the model size and the GQA configuration to arrive at a better allocation of inference resources between attention layers and other components. Our analysis reveals that commonly used GQA configurations are highly suboptimal for long-context scenarios. More importantly, we propose a recipe for deriving cost-optimal GQA configurations. Our results show that for long-context scenarios, one should use fewer attention heads while scaling up model size. Configurations selected by our recipe can reduce both memory usage and FLOPs by more than 50% compared to Llama-3's GQA, with *no degradation in model capabilities*. Our findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient long-context LLMs. The code is available at https://www.github.com/THUNLP/cost-optimal-gqa .

Abstract: Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of personalized driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving styles. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.

<title>Detecting Scarce and Sparse Anomalous: Solving Dual Imbalance in Multi-Instance Learning</title>

Abstract: In real-world applications, it is highly challenging to detect anomalous samples with extremely sparse anomalies, as they are highly similar to and thus easily confused with normal samples. Moreover, the number of anomalous samples is inherently scarce. This results in a dual imbalance Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) problem, manifesting at both the macro and micro levels. To address this "needle-in-a-haystack problem", we find that MIL problem can be reformulated as a fine-grained PU learning problem. This allows us to address the imbalance issue in an unbiased manner using micro-level balancing mechanisms. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU)-based on rigorous theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU.

Abstract: As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources, compensating data contributors has become a central concern. But how should these payments be devised? We revisit data valuations from a $\textit{market-design perspective}$ where payments serve to compensate data owners for the $\textit{private}$ heterogeneous costs they incur for collecting and sharing data. We show that popular valuation methods-such as Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley-make for poor payments. They fail to ensure truthful reporting of the costs, leading to $\textit{inefficient market}$ outcomes. To address this, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namely Myerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We show that Myerson payment is the minimal truthful mechanism, optimal from the buyer's perspective. Additionally, we identify a condition under which both data buyers and sellers are utility-satisfied, and the market achieves efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentive compatibility into data valuation design, paving the way for more robust and efficient data markets. Our data market framework is readily applicable to real-world scenarios. We illustrate this with simulations of contributor compensation in an LLM based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) marketplace tasked with challenging medical question answering.

Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.

<title>Can Code Language Models Learn Clarification-Seeking Behaviors?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, a gap remains between their output and the problem-solving strategies of human developers. Unlike humans, who spend substantial time disambiguating requirements through iterative dialogue, LLMs often generate code despite ambiguities in natural language requirements, leading to unreliable solutions. Different from prior work, we study whether a Code LLM can be fine-tuned to learn clarification-seeking behavior. While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves, especially in agentic AI where models and humans collaborate. We present ClarifyCoder, a framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that fine-tunes an LLM to identify ambiguities and request clarification before code generation. Our approach has two components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements. We also provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for joint optimization of clarification-awareness and coding ability. Experimental results show that ClarifyCoder achieves a 63% communication rate (40% absolute increase) and a 52% good question rate (30% absolute increase) on ambiguous tasks, significantly improving LLMs' communication capabilities while maintaining code generation performance.

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges in wireless communication systems, often beyond the capability of traditional optimization techniques. To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness. Experimental results show that LLM-OptiRA achieves an execution rate of 96% and a success rate of 80% on GPT-4, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in complex optimization tasks across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Language is a powerful communicative and cognitive tool. It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.

<title>UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose UltraEdit, a training-, subject-, and memory-free approach that is well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. UltraEdit fundamentally differs from traditional paradigms by computing parameter shifts in one step using only a hidden state and its gradient, making the approach simple yet efficient. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, UltraEdit employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. UltraEdit achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method, which was also the fastest known approach, while using less than 1/4 the VRAM. This makes it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct UltraEditBench, the largest dataset in the field to date with over 2M editing pairs, and demonstrate that our method supports up to 2M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets and six models show that UltraEdit consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios, taking a further step towards safe and scalable lifelong learning.

Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit position bias - a systematic tendency to neglect information at specific context positions. However, the patterns of position bias behavior, depending on the language or model, remain unexplored. We present a multilingual study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, and Vietnamese) and five model architectures, examining how position bias interacts with prompt strategies and affects output entropy. Our key findings are: (1) Position bias is primarily model-driven, yet exhibits language-specific variations. For instance, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek 7B Chat consistently favors late positions, challenging established assumptions of a universal early-token bias in LLMs. (2) Explicitly instructing the model that "the context is relevant to the query" unexpectedly reduces accuracy across languages, undermining common prompt-engineering practices. (3) While the largest accuracy drop occurs when relevant information is placed in the middle of the context, this is not explicitly reflected by a corresponding peak in output entropy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/ARC_JSD.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specified data, but its efficacy is typically assessed with task-level metrics like accuracy and perplexity. We demonstrate that these metrics are often misleading, as models can appear to forget while their original behavior is easily restored through minimal fine-tuning. This phenomenon of \emph{reversibility} suggests that information is merely suppressed, not genuinely erased. To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce a \emph{representation-level analysis framework}. Our toolkit comprises PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment (CKA), and Fisher information, complemented by a summary metric, the mean PCA distance, to measure representational drift. Applying this framework across six unlearning methods, three data domains, and two LLMs, we identify four distinct forgetting regimes based on their \emph{reversibility} and \emph{catastrophicity}. Our analysis reveals that achieving the ideal state--irreversible, non-catastrophic forgetting--is exceptionally challenging. By probing the limits of unlearning, we identify a case of seemingly irreversible, targeted forgetting, offering new insights for designing more robust erasure algorithms. Our findings expose a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a representation-level foundation for trustworthy unlearning.

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence, capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

arXiv:2505.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence (AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication (SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless, SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP), which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.

<title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>

Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics. The model performs continuous fusion via a gating mechanism between the branches to enhance the model's ability to detect violent activities even in challenging surveillance scenarios. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, SURV and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark and also on DVD dataset which is another novel dataset on video violence detection, offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, near real-time surveillance violence detection.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial code "improvements".

<title>HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data</title>

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances across numerous vision-language tasks. MLLMs have shown promising capability in aligning visual and textual modalities, allowing them to process image-text pairs with clear and explicit meanings. However, resolving the inherent ambiguities present in real-world language and visual contexts remains a challenge. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes first a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and second a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during communication rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual question answering, and code generation, yet their ability to reason on these tasks in different languages remains underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. We propose M2A, a novel method that combines multi-scale multilingual alignment with language-consistency rewards on machine-translated questions, training models to reason directly and accurately in the target language. Furthermore, existing multilingual benchmarks only evaluate on final answers, overlooking whether reasoning occurs in the intended language. To close this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark together with reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. Our results show that M2A significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity in both mathematical and factual reasoning tasks, highlighting that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/M2A_GeoFact-X

<title>A Unified Empirical Risk Minimization Framework for Flexible N-Tuples Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. Instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and RAG frameworks for external knowledge access are also reviewed. The key findings demonstrate the limitations of current metrics, the importance of validated external evidence, and the improvement of factual consistency through domain-specific customization. The review underscores the importance of building more accurate, understandable, and context-aware fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy models.

Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training. Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their \textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Causal inference in settings involving complex spatio-temporal dependencies, such as environmental epidemiology, is challenging due to the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, a significant gap persists in existing methods: current diffusion-based causal models rely on restrictive assumptions of causal sufficiency or static confounding. To address this limitation, we introduce the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach uniquely incorporates valid backdoor adjustments into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from unmeasured confounders. Specifically, it captures their intricate dynamics through region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates multi-resolution variables via functional data techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by establishing error bounds for counterfactual estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world air pollution case study confirm that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al., 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted consensus judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify subjective traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Hence, to validate our method, we collect human judgments on the same ensemble of models and show that EigenBench's judgments align closely with those of human evaluators. We further demonstrate that EigenBench can recover model rankings on the GPQA benchmark without access to objective labels, supporting its viability as a framework for evaluating subjective values for which no ground truths exist.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization problem $f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(\mathbf{x})$, where each local function has the form of $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = {\mathbb E}\left[F(\mathbf{x};{\boldsymbol \xi}_i)\right]$ which is $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth but possibly nonconvex and the random variable ${\boldsymbol \xi}_i$ follows distribution ${\mathcal D}_i$. We propose a novel algorithm called decentralized normalized stochastic gradient descent (DNSGD), which can achieve an $\epsilon$-stationary point at each local agent. We present a new framework for analyzing decentralized first-order methods in the relaxed smooth setting, based on the Lyapunov function related to the product of the gradient norm and the consensus error. We show the upper bounds on the sample complexity of ${\mathcal O}(m^{-1}(L_f\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-4} + \sigma^2\epsilon^{-2} + L_f^{-2}L_1^3\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-1} + L_f^{-2}L_1^2\sigma^2))$ per agent and the communication complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}((L_f\epsilon^{-2} + L_1\epsilon^{-1})\gamma^{-1/2}\Delta_f)$, where $L_f=L_0 +L_1\zeta$, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the stochastic gradient, $\Delta_f$ is the initial optimal function value gap, $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the network, and $\zeta$ is the degree of the gradient dissimilarity. In the special case of $L_1=0$, the above results (nearly) match the lower bounds of decentralized stochastic nonconvex optimization under the standard smoothness. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the empirical superiority of our method.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

Abstract: Audio super-resolution (SR), i.e., upsampling the low-resolution (LR) waveform to the high-resolution (HR) version, has recently been explored with diffusion and bridge models, while previous methods often suffer from sub-optimal upsampling quality due to their uninformative generation prior. Towards high-quality audio super-resolution, we present a new system with latent bridge models (LBMs), where we compress the audio waveform into a continuous latent space and design an LBM to enable a latent-to-latent generation process that naturally matches the LR-toHR upsampling process, thereby fully exploiting the instructive prior information contained in the LR waveform. To further enhance the training results despite the limited availability of HR samples, we introduce frequency-aware LBMs, where the prior and target frequency are taken as model input, enabling LBMs to explicitly learn an any-to-any upsampling process at the training stage. Furthermore, we design cascaded LBMs and present two prior augmentation strategies, where we make the first attempt to unlock the audio upsampling beyond 48 kHz and empower a seamless cascaded SR process, providing higher flexibility for audio post-production. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated on the VCTK, ESC-50, Song-Describer benchmark datasets and two internal testsets demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art objective and perceptual quality for any-to-48kHz SR across speech, audio, and music signals, as well as setting the first record for any-to-192kHz audio SR.

Abstract: In computational physics, a longstanding challenge lies in finding numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, research attention has increasingly focused on Neural Operator methods, which are notable for their ability to approximate operators-mappings between functions. Although neural operators benefit from a universal approximation theorem, achieving reliable error bounds often necessitates large model architectures, such as deep stacks of Fourier layers. This raises a natural question: Can we design lightweight models without sacrificing generalization? To address this, we introduce DimINO (Dimension-Informed Neural Operators), a framework inspired by dimensional analysis. DimINO incorporates two key components, DimNorm and a redimensionalization operation, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural operator architectures. These components enhance the model's ability to generalize across datasets with varying physical parameters. Theoretically, we establish a universal approximation theorem for DimINO and prove that it satisfies a critical property we term Similar Transformation Invariance (STI). Empirically, DimINO achieves up to 76.3% performance gain on PDE datasets while exhibiting clear evidence of the STI property.

Summary:<br />
The article focuses on offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies in the presence of uncertain disturbances. It examines scenarios where disturbances can be estimated in a controlled environment and when they are unknown in a stochastic setting. The approach combines adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to develop algorithms and sample-based approximations inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) principles. For scenarios involving non-measurable disturbances, stability and convergence guarantees for learned control gains are established under sample-based approximations. The methodology aims for simplicity while providing robust guarantees.

Abstract: We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.

Summary:
DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model, is introduced to tackle the challenge of synthesizing crystalline materials like zeolites. The model is trained on a vast dataset of synthesis recipes and can generate probable synthesis routes based on a desired zeolite structure and organic template. DiffSyn's performance is top-notch as it can capture the complex structure-synthesis relationships. This model is utilized to distinguish between competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. In a successful demonstration, DiffSyn is used to synthesize a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ ratio of 19.0, which surpasses previous records and is expected to enhance thermal stability. The rationalization of the synthesis routes via density functional theory binding energies adds a layer of credibility to the process. <div>

Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.

<div> Distribution Compression, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Bilateral Distribution Compression, Decoded MMD, Low-Dimensional Projection

Summary:
Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC) is proposed as a two-stage framework for compressing large datasets while preserving the underlying distribution. BDC operates with linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. The Decoded MMD (DMMD) is introduced to quantify the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC utilizes the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD) to learn a low-dimensional projection and the Encoded MMD (EMMD) to optimize a latent compressed set. By minimizing the DMMD, BDC ensures that the compressed set accurately represents the original distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at a significantly lower cost.

Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.

Summary: In this paper, the researchers address the issue of redundancy in decision trees within the Rashomon set and its implications on feature importance and accuracy. They introduce the MBDSR approach, utilizing the Quine-McCluskey method to determine predictive equivalence among decision trees. However, they find that the QM method can exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space for certain decision trees. They demonstrate that the MBDSR approach may produce incorrect results in some cases and propose algorithms that can solve related problems in polynomial time. Through experiments, they show that their algorithms are significantly faster than previous methods for decision trees triggering worst-case scenarios with the QM method. This research highlights the importance of efficient methods for decision tree analysis and provides solutions for improving accuracy and computational efficiency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that, depending on the QM method implementation, the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.

Summary:<br />
Generative flow networks are extended to multi-agent settings with the introduction of MA-GFlowNets, allowing collaborative object generation through joint actions. A theoretical framework for MA-GFlowNets is presented, along with four algorithms: centralized, independent, joint, and updated conditional flow networks. The joint flow network employs a local-global principle for training multiple local networks as a single global network, ensuring efficient training and theoretical guarantees on sample generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework over traditional reinforcement learning and MCMC methods. <div>
arXiv:2509.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of (local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods.

Summary:
FastEagle is introduced as a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that can generate an entire draft in a single forward pass, compared to state-of-the-art drafters like EAGLE that require sequential passes. By using a layer cascade and training with layer-wise supervision, FastEagle minimizes error accumulation. It utilizes a constrained draft tree to maintain lossless verification cost. FastEagle outperforms EAGLE-3 in terms of speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, while maintaining competitive acceptance lengths. Testing on various large language models (LLMs) and tasks shows that FastEagle consistently delivers faster inference times without sacrificing quality, indicating that eliminating sequential dependencies in drafting can significantly accelerate LLM generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation. Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior. Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths. These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

Summary: 
- The study introduces a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to model daily ozone variability and trends in climate models lacking interactive ozone representation due to high computational costs.
- mloz exhibits high fidelity on decadal timescales and can be used online in both UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and German ICON model, producing stable ozone predictions 31 times faster than traditional chemistry schemes.
- Using only atmospheric temperature data as input, mloz accounts for less than 4 percent of total climate model runtimes.
- The parameterization is transferable between different climate models, demonstrating potential adoption in CMIP-level models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments.
- Particularly beneficial for climate sensitivity simulations, mloz can capture ozone trends and variability that significantly influence atmospheric feedback processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes. Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31 times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4 percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments, particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback processes.

Summary:
The article discusses the privacy concerns related to Electroencephalography (EEG) data and the potential risks of re-identification and leakage of personal information. To address these challenges, a transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data while maintaining its utility for machine learning tasks. The study focuses on automatic sleep staging as an application and evaluates the effectiveness of the anonymization technique in reducing the re-identifiability of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the risk of re-identification while still preserving the data's utility for machine learning applications. This finding highlights the importance of safeguarding sensitive EEG data from potential privacy breaches while also enabling its use in beneficial applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced while preserving its utility for machine learning.

In this study, the researchers investigate the vulnerability of memorization-based influence estimators to adversarial attacks. They demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating memorization scores by proposing a practical attack method involving the calculation of the pseudoinverse of the input data. The attack, which only requires black-box access to model outputs, is shown to be effective across various image classification tasks.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MemAttack-5413/

By utilizing a quasimetric representation space with additional constraints, the proposed method can learn optimal goal-reaching policies even in suboptimal data and stochastic environments. This approach bridges the gap between the stability of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods and the flexibility of quasimetric network parameterizations. Empirical results show that the new representation learning objective enhances performance on stitching tasks where contrastive learning methods struggle, as well as in noisy, high-dimensional environments where quasimetric network methods encounter challenges. Overall, the unified framework offers improved capabilities for solving goal-reaching tasks with a combination of stability and adaptability.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel deep learning framework for analyzing EEG signals, addressing challenges such as noise and channel variability. The proposed encoder captures multi-scale frequency oscillations and interactions across EEG channels through an attention-based mechanism. A gating network filters out noisy channels to enhance data reliability. A novel loss function combines supervised and contrastive learning for improved generalization. The framework was validated in tasks such as classifying CNS disorders treatments and diagnosing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, showing the ability to extract meaningful patterns, select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization. <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species, autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization through innovative architectural and loss design.

<div> Keywords: clustering, rule-guided, multimodal, domain-specific constraints, variational autoencoder

Summary: 
The Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE) introduces a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data-driven features into a unified latent space, enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. By treating rules as first-class learning signals and integrating them into the clustering process, DARTVAE produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show that rule-guided clustering improves traditional clustering metrics and yields more meaningful clusters, such as isolating UAVs or separating SUVs from sedans. However, challenges include rule hallucinations, overfitting, and scalability issues. DARTVAE demonstrates the utility of constraint-guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge-intensive domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Summary: 
Attention layers in sequence-to-sequence mapping depend on pairwise interactions, leading to quadratic scaling of memory and compute with sequence length. To address this, sparsity or recurrent dependence is introduced, both with drawbacks. A novel algorithm proposed combines advantages of both by efficiently inverting tree-structured matrices. This innovation aims to improve computational efficiency and overcome the limitations of existing methods, offering a promising solution for handling large-scale sequence processing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape, size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness. Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved durability and reduced internal damage.

<div> keywords: Policy gradient methods, entropy maximization, complexity bonus, Proximal Policy Optimization, CDPO

Summary: 
Policy gradient methods often use entropy maximization to balance exploration and exploitation. However, this approach can result in inefficient exploration strategies as it pushes policies towards a uniform random distribution. In response, this work proposes using a complexity bonus instead of entropy. The complexity bonus is a combination of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, encouraging policies that strike a balance between stochasticity and structure. This new approach, named Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), is shown to be more robust to changes in the complexity coefficient compared to traditional methods using entropy coefficients. CDPO promotes the discovery of structured yet adaptable strategies, making it especially effective in environments that require significant exploration. <div>
arXiv:2509.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity (high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially in environments requiring greater exploration.

Summary: 
This article presents a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms used in recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements in inverse problems. The algorithms are interpreted as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections, particularly effective when the data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set. By assuming a restricted isometry property of the sensing matrix over the model set, the study establishes quantitative convergence rates that depend on the noise schedule. The framework is applied to uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets, and low-rank Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set. <div>

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Summary: 
Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) are a novel concept bottleneck model that combines an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic reasoning circuit to produce interpretable predictions. However, NPCs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate attribute predictions. This paper analyzes the adversarial robustness of NPCs and introduces RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit that improves adversarial robustness by integrating outputs from both modules in a class-wise manner. The theoretical analysis shows that RNPC is more resilient to attacks compared to NPCs. Empirical results on image classification tasks demonstrate that RNPC achieves superior robustness against adversarial inputs while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.

Summary: 
The study compares two hybrid classifiers, XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR), for diabetes risk stratification. XGB-RF outperformed SVM-LR in both internal and external cohorts, achieving higher AUROC and AUPRC values. The performance of XGB-RF remained strong on the external PIMA cohort, with acceptable calibration. Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 showed XGB-RF had higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared to SVM-LR. The results support the use of XGBoost-based hybridization as a robust and transferable approach for diabetes risk prediction. Prospective multi-site validation and deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs are recommended for further research.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and (ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe, standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC ~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990; AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941; Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall 0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for physics-informed generation by framing it as a sparse reward optimization problem. The authors propose Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) to address issues with prior methods that rely on diffusion posterior sampling. PIRF calculates trajectory-level rewards and directly backpropagates their gradients to ensure adherence to physical constraints. To enhance efficiency, PIRF utilizes a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method tailored to physics-based rewards and a weight-based regularization scheme for improved data fidelity. Results across five PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIRF consistently outperforms existing methods in enforcing physical constraints while maintaining efficient sampling. This study showcases the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However, a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes, highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling.

Summary:
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) aim to provide predictive uncertainty in scientific applications, helping to identify when a model may be extrapolating or when more data is needed. However, accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) with BNNs can be challenging due to the complexity of hyperparameter choices and the approximations used in model training. A global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under various hyperparameter settings revealed that hyperparameters interact to impact both predictive accuracy and UQ. To enhance the practical use of BNNs, it is recommended to use global sensitivity analysis or Bayesian optimization to reduce dimensionality and select hyperparameters effectively. By improving hyperparameter selection, researchers can ensure accurate UQ in Bayesian Neural Networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective representations.

Unlike traditional black-box approaches, our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

<div> Keywords: Backpropagation, neural SDE solvers, reversible solvers, Runge-Kutta schemes, memory efficiency 

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel class of stable and near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes offer memory-efficient training without sacrificing stability, allowing for accurate gradient computations in a scalable manner. Previous approaches to backpropagation through neural SDE solvers have been hindered by either high memory costs or slow evaluation speeds, but the EES schemes aim to overcome these limitations by combining the benefits of reversible solvers with improved stability. By demonstrating superior performance in numerical experiments, the EES schemes prove to be a practical foundation for effectively training neural SDEs, enabling efficient and accurate gradient computations even in complex models with large step sizes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs. These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Summary:
Function encoders, a novel technique, learn neural network basis functions to create adaptive representations of function Hilbert spaces. They establish a connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through the learned feature map's inner product. This kernel perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while conforming to data structure, enabling kernel-style analysis of neural models. Two training algorithms are developed: a progressive approach that incrementally builds bases and a train-then-prune method post-training. Both use PCA principles to reveal the learned space's intrinsic dimension. Generalization bounds are derived using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, ensuring inference time guarantees. Experimental validation on polynomial and nonlinear dynamical systems illustrates achieving comparable accuracy with fewer basis functions. This research paves the way for neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, delivering adaptable, efficient, and principled models at scale.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.

<div> Keywords: mutual information, denoising diffusion models, density estimation, information-theoretic formulation, adaptive importance sampling

Summary: 
Mutual information (MI) is a challenging quantity to estimate for complex systems, but denoising diffusion models have shown promise in improving this estimation. By utilizing the information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, this study demonstrates a straightforward approach to estimating MI. The MI is calculated as half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. This method not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Additionally, adaptive importance sampling is leveraged to achieve scalable MI estimation, maintaining strong performance even at high MI values. Overall, the use of denoising diffusion models offers a promising avenue for improving mutual information estimation in complex systems.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI. In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong performance even when the MI is high.

Summary: <br />
Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is a process where an agent improves its skills over time through experience. However, evolving skills may not be compatible with existing policies, limiting their reusability. The SIL-C framework addresses this issue by ensuring compatibility between evolving skills and policies without the need for re-training. It uses a mapping technique to align subtask space with skill space, allowing each subtask to be executed efficiently by selecting the right skill. SIL-C was tested in various scenarios and proved to maintain compatibility while enhancing performance. <div>
arXiv:2509.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C, a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency throughout the learning process.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges in training Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex multi-turn task planning. By transforming the multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems and utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense reward from expert trajectories, the proposed method achieves efficient policy optimization. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning leads to higher success probability in multi-turn tasks under minimal turns and generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental results show that a 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO outperforms larger baseline models up to 14B parameters in complex task planning, achieving success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. The strong cross-task generalizability is validated, showing that models trained on complex tasks can successfully complete all simpler subtasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler subtasks.

Summary:
Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL) is a novel federated learning framework that addresses data privacy constraints in multi-site functional MRI studies. It enables collaborative modeling without sharing raw data by performing independent dictionary learning at each site. PFedDL decomposes site-specific dictionaries into shared global components and personalized local components. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to ensure cross-site consistency, while the local atoms capture site-specific variability. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset show that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets. This innovative approach allows for more efficient and effective analysis of neuroimaging data while respecting data privacy constraints.

arXiv:2509.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.

Summary: 
The paper explores the use of Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) in music conversation and investigates if these models truly listen to audio or rely on textual reasoning. They implement the MM-SHAP framework to quantify the contribution of each modality to the model's output on the MuChoMusic benchmark. The study reveals that models with higher accuracy tend to rely more on text for answering questions. However, even when the overall audio contribution is low, models can still effectively identify key sound events, indicating that audio is not completely disregarded. This research is the first to apply MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, paving the way for future studies in explainable AI and audio analysis.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low, models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in explainable AI and audio.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent reinforcement learning, artificial curiosity, exploration, intrinsic motivation, decentralized settings

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called CERMIC that aims to improve exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios with sparse rewards. Existing artificial curiosity mechanisms often fail to distinguish between true novelty and stochastic environmental variability, leading to suboptimal exploration. CERMIC addresses this issue by dynamically adjusting agents' intrinsic curiosity based on multi-agent context, allowing them to filter out irrelevant surprises. This framework generates intrinsic rewards that incentivize agents to explore state transitions that provide significant information gain. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that exploration with CERMIC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing multi-agent exploration in communication-free decentralized settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on using machine learning to predict the resources needed for massively parallel chemistry computations, specifically coupled-cluster methods, to assist users in planning experiments on supercomputers. The research addresses two main questions: finding the optimal parameter configurations for shortest execution time and minimizing resource usage. By evaluating various ML models and strategies using data from CCSD application runs on DOE's Frontier and Aurora supercomputers, the study achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting execution times. A Gradient Boosting model performs well in predicting CCSD iteration times on both supercomputers, with minimal errors. Additionally, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using active learning to reduce the number of experiments needed to collect data points, producing accurate predictions with a limited number of data samples. <div>
arXiv:2509.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE) Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from Aurora and Frontier.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a non-asymptotic lower bound linking the minimal number of demonstrations required for stable in-context learning (ICL) to prompt length sensitivity. It establishes explicit sufficient conditions based on the spectral properties of covariance, offering a practical criterion for implementation. The proposed two-stage observable estimator, with one-shot calibration, provides prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experimental results demonstrate the close alignment between predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a reliable upper bound. Furthermore, the calibrated variant tightens this gap, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance, providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning, graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class or content.

<br />
Summary: In the study, the authors explore the use of federated learning (FL) for collaborative fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) while preserving privacy. Despite the belief that FL protects privacy by aggregating generalized knowledge in a global model, the findings reveal that attackers can still extract training data from the model. This privacy leakage increases with the model size and can be exacerbated by an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL. To address these privacy risks, the study evaluates various techniques including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety alignment in LLMs. These results offer valuable insights and practical guidelines for organizations looking to mitigate privacy risks when fine-tuning LLMs using federated learning. <div>
arXiv:2509.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening. While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

<div> genetic algorithm, molecular design, synthesizability, property optimization, machine learning filter

Summary:
SynGA is a genetic algorithm specifically designed to operate directly on synthesis routes in molecular design. It features custom crossover and mutation operators that ensure synthesizability of the generated molecules, making it effective for various design tasks like synthesizable analog search and property optimization in both 2D and 3D dimensions. By modifying the fitness function and coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter for building blocks, the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. SynGBO, a variant of SynGA, combines it with block filtering in Bayesian optimization for efficient property optimization. Due to its lightweight nature and inherent focus on synthesizability, SynGA can serve as a strong standalone baseline and be seamlessly integrated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future. <div>

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

<div> Keywords: scaling laws, deep learning, redundancy laws, data covariance spectrum, model performance<br />
Summary:<br />
The study explores the mathematical underpinnings of scaling laws in deep learning, uncovering a connection to redundancy laws. By employing kernel regression, the researchers demonstrate that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum leads to an excess risk power law with a specific exponent. This exponent is determined by the spectral tail parameter beta, reflecting the level of redundancy in the data. The slope of the learning curve is shown to depend on data redundancy, with steeper spectra resulting in accelerated returns to scale. The universality of these findings is validated across various transformations, mixtures, approximations, and architectures, including Transformer models. This work provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

Summary:
This paper introduces a study on the impact of audio watermarking on anti-spoofing systems. By creating the Watermark-Spoofing dataset with various watermarking techniques, the researchers found that watermarking consistently decreases the performance of anti-spoofing systems, with higher watermark density leading to higher error rates. To address this issue, they propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, allowing models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while maintaining their original spoofing detection capability. These results highlight audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and provide a benchmark for developing anti-spoofing systems resilient to watermarks. The related protocols can be accessed at https://github.com/Alphawarheads/Watermark_Spoofing.git.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets, named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Summary:
The study compares Transformer-based models GReaT and REaLTabFormer for synthetic tabular data generation. It evaluates the impact of hyperparameters on runtime, machine learning utility, and similarity to real data distributions across different model setups. Results show that runtime increases with the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT outperforms REaLTabFormer in runtime efficiency, but REaLTabFormer maintains high utility and similarity on larger datasets. REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs strikes the best balance between data quality and computational requirements. Despite efficiency gains, there is a limit to reducing runtime. The study suggests that lightweight LLMs can enhance efficiency without compromising data quality for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

<div> machine learning, learned indexes, dynamic updates, retraining cost, Sig2Model

Summary: 
Sig2Model is a novel approach to efficient and adaptive learned indexing that addresses the challenges of dynamic updates. By utilizing a sigmoid boosting approximation technique, the index model can be dynamically adjusted to account for shifts in data distribution without the need for full retraining, reducing retraining costs. Proactive update training using Gaussian mixture models allows for strategic placeholder allocation in high-update-probability regions, further speeding up updates. A neural joint optimization framework continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters, improving overall performance. In evaluations against existing approaches, Sig2Model demonstrated a reduction in retraining cost by up to 20x, achieved up to 3x higher queries-per-second (QPS), and used significantly less memory, making it a promising solution for real-world workloads with frequent updates. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS) metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively, rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel approach that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve multivariate time-series forecasting.
- MLP models are effective in capturing long-term dependencies but struggle with diverse distributions and local variations in data.
- CNNs are better at incorporating these variations, so the proposed model combines MLP for overall trend modeling and CNN for capturing fine-grained local patterns.
- The proposed architecture, IConv, processes temporal dependency channels independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers, allowing for efficient modeling of diverse local temporal patterns.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Summary:
This article discusses the challenge of data efficiency in large-scale models due to the finite nature of high-quality data. It introduces a framework to improve data efficiency by formalizing the inductive bias of linear time-invariant State Space Models (SSMs) through an SSM-induced kernel. The method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI) is proposed, specifically power spectrum matching, to align the model's bias with the task's spectral characteristics before training. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TDI significantly enhances generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data scenarios. This work presents a theoretical and practical approach to developing more data-efficient models, contributing to the sustainable scaling of machine learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge. One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Summary:
Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer robustness from teacher to student without accessing training data. However, existing methods overlook robust fairness issues, causing significant variation in robustness across different categories. Two key problems were identified: variations in student behavior across categories with equal class proportions and instability of student robustness across different attack targets. To address these issues, Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework was introduced. FERD adjusts the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples by implementing robustness-guided class reweighting and generating Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) and Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs). Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under various adversarial attacks, improving robustness and fairness simultaneously.<br /><br />Summary: Data-Free Robustness Distillation transfers robustness but neglects fairness, leading to disparities. FERD addresses this by adjusting proportions and distributions of adversarial examples, improving worst-class robustness and fairness simultaneously. <div>

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and (2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack (e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by 15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Summary: 
The article introduces T2I-Diff, a framework for generating fMRI data that addresses the limitations of existing generative models. By leveraging time-frequency representation and classifier-free denoising diffusion, T2I-Diff captures complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. The framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms using a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. A classifier-free diffusion model is then trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are converted back to BOLD signals. The efficacy of the approach is validated through improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.<br />

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

arXiv:2509.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&amp;A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.

<br />Summary: 
This work aims to explain late-phase phenomena in deep neural networks, such as grokking and the information bottleneck principle. The authors propose a unified explanation based on the concept of neural collapse, which involves the contraction of population within-class variance in learned representations. They show that this measure is key to understanding both grokking and the information bottleneck effect.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal fusion, effective competitive strength, mutual information, FastPID, asynchronous training

Summary:
In the study, a two-stage training framework is proposed to address modality competition in multi-modal fusion. The concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) is introduced to quantify a modality's dominance during training. The framework utilizes mutual information (MI) as a proxy for ECS and develops the FastPID solver for partial information decomposition. An asynchronous training controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and synergy. By shaping the initial states through unimodal training, the method achieves a tighter error bound and better performance in multi-modal fusion tasks. The approach proves to be effective in mitigating modality competition and enhancing synergy among different modalities. The experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method in multi-modal fusion tasks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of pre-fusion model initialization in optimizing multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state, most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces MOIRA, a method for integrative analysis of multi-omics data with missing modalities. MOIRA utilizes representation alignment and adaptive aggregation to project omics datasets onto a shared embedding space, allowing for robust learning from incomplete data. Tested on the ROSMAP dataset for Alzheimer's Disease, MOIRA outperformed existing methods and was able to identify AD-related biomarkers. Ablation studies confirmed the contributions of each modality, highlighting the effectiveness of MOIRA in capturing complex biomolecular interactions.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples, including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them. Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches, and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Time series generation, conditional models, causal perspective, CaTSG, interventions, counterfactuals

Summary: 
This article introduces the concept of causal time series generation (CaTSG), which goes beyond traditional conditional models by considering unobserved confounding and incorporating interventions and counterfactual scenarios. The CaTSG framework utilizes Pearl's causal ladder to guide the generation process, allowing for the creation of realistic time series sequences under different causal conditions. By incorporating backdoor adjustment and causal score functions, CaTSG can generate sequences that accurately reflect the effects of interventions and individual counterfactuals. Experimental results demonstrate that CaTSG outperforms existing baselines in terms of fidelity and support for interventional and counterfactual generation. The proposed causal TSG family and the CaTSG framework represent a novel approach to time series synthesis, offering promising possibilities for more reliable simulation in various causal scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.

<div> Keywords: newborns, artificial intelligence, fetal heart rate monitoring, missing data, autoencoder<br />
Summary:<br />
Approximately 10% of newborns require breathing assistance at birth, and 5% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is crucial for assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care and detecting abnormal patterns. AI methods can analyze large FHR datasets to predict the risk of interventions. Wearable FHR monitors allow continuous monitoring but face signal dropouts due to sensor displacement. The proposed masked transformer-based autoencoder can reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing spatial and frequency components, preserving spectral characteristics. This approach is robust for varying durations of missing data, enabling signal inpainting and forecasting. It can be applied to research datasets for developing AI-based risk algorithms and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitors for early risk detection. <br /><br />Summary: 
- Newborns often need breathing assistance at birth, with FHR monitoring being critical for fetal well-being assessment.
- AI analysis of FHR data can predict the need for interventions based on diverse outcomes.
- Wearable FHR monitors face signal dropouts, which the proposed autoencoder can reconstruct robustly.
- This approach preserves signal characteristics and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting.
- Integration into wearable devices could enhance early risk detection. <div>

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines, especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

<title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

<title>Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution. Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance, alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for global imbalance.

<title>Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction, trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons, enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model. During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance (with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

<title>Deep Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Scales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to 2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq. miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance, especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency, with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve (PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve. The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

arXiv:2509.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid, implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

<title>Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments, progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon, demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

<title>Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations</title>

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

<title>Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy</title>

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

<title>CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework</title>

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<title>Toward Robust and Efficient ML-Based GPU Caching for Modern Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20979</link>

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.

<title>Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S \subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto \exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$ that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for $k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without [Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA '24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC '19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the truncated Ising model.

<title>Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.

<title>Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices</title>

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.

<title>Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

<title>ExMolRL: Phenotype-Target Joint Generation of De Novo Molecules via Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse, and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.

<title>Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.

<title>Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<title>DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

arXiv:2509.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse, multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.

<title>FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches. Our code is open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm_rl_probing_analysis-F673.

Efficient learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations. Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning $\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the stationary trajectories.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

<title>SPREAD: Sampling-based Pareto front Refinement via Efficient Adaptive Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

<title>Structure-Attribute Transformations with Markov Chain Boost Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization, SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

<title>ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between "Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff.

<title>TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix</title>

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

<title>Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as \textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

<title>EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense</title>

arXiv:2509.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.

arXiv:2509.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/killian31/SPCARobustness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However, without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces.

arXiv:2509.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline. However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

arXiv:2509.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective, relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain (e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i) route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii) aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii) fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity. We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further, MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jacobfa/mot.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model. While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities, existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences, that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

<title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>

arXiv:2509.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics: local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper, we propose the {\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral {\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection, anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making. Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art. Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization. This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT, which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: There has been a considerable interest in constrained training of deep neural networks (DNNs) recently for applications such as fairness and safety. Several toolkits have been proposed for this task, yet there is still no industry standard. We present humancompatible.train (https://github.com/humancompatible/train), an easily-extendable PyTorch-based Python package for training DNNs with stochastic constraints. We implement multiple previously unimplemented algorithms for stochastically constrained stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the toolkit use by comparing two algorithms on a deep learning task with fairness constraints.

<title>A Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Model for Multi-Region and Multi-Pollutant Air Quality Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health, environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU.

<title>It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

<title>Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

<title>No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting, and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for healthcare.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible PhIML.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages. Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types. Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME, were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance, enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical drone operations.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+ deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations. These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama 8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints, representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic deception contexts.

Abstract: We develop a new high-dimensional statistical learning model which can take advantage of structured correlation in data even in the presence of randomness. We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's classification theory). This model suggests a theoretical explanation for the success of certain algorithms in the 2006~Netflix Prize competition.

<title>Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

<title>SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent</title>

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work, we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/conformal-importance-summarization.

<title>Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens</title>

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

<title>Fast Estimation of Wasserstein Distances via Regression on Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole, particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

<title>Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands, thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments.

<title>A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition</title>

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme. Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the literature.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy. When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2% and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model. Our open-source code and data is released at https://github.com/chipermaria/every-character-counts.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge. This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models (LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment, retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and democratize network control for everyday users.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments, such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads, helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM) across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC container community, guiding future research and tool development.

Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Abstract: As software systems grow in scale and complexity, understanding the distribution of programming language topics within source code becomes increasingly important for guiding technical decisions, improving onboarding, and informing tooling and education. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis and data-driven software engineering.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying, whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error. We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware super-resolution.

<title>Cryptographic Backdoor for Neural Networks: Boon and Bane</title>

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes.

<title>Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity</title>

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal $\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size $D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$. In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$ provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon), 1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error $\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a $c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

<title>Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

To properly do so, we also define partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian reverse differential category.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations. Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time, spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite. Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

<title>RollPacker: Mitigating Long-Tail Rollouts for Fast, Synchronous RL Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

<title>Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort, outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$, which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs, showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while keeping raw data decentralized, making it a conduit for leveraging the power of IoT devices while maintaining privacy of the locally collected data. However, existing privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited scalability. This survey examines emerging approaches that hold promise for enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing (QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues, offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

<title>WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective</title>

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem.

<title>Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy</title>

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X) Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules -- encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators, including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&amp;R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&amp;R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&amp;R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al. (2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel hyperparameters.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

<title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural information about how movements relate to one another, this information is frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

<title>RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback &amp; Verifiable Rewards</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

<title>Learning to Bid Optimally and Efficiently in Adversarial First-price Auctions</title>

Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.

Abstract: We consider a contextual bandit problem with a combinatorial action set and time-varying base arm availability. At the beginning of each round, the agent observes the set of available base arms and their contexts and then selects an action that is a feasible subset of the set of available base arms to maximize its cumulative reward in the long run. We assume that the mean outcomes of base arms are samples from a Gaussian Process (GP) indexed by the context set ${\cal X}$, and the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes. For this setup, we propose an algorithm called Optimistic Combinatorial Learning and Optimization with Kernel Upper Confidence Bounds (O'CLOK-UCB) and prove that it incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\lambda^*(K)KT\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)} )$ regret with high probability, where $\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)$ is the maximum information gain associated with the sets of base arm contexts $\mathcal{X}_t$ that appeared in the first $T$ rounds, $K$ is the maximum cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds, and $\lambda^*(K)$ is the maximum eigenvalue of all covariance matrices of selected actions up to time $T$, which is a function of $K$. To dramatically speed up the algorithm, we also propose a variant of O'CLOK-UCB that uses sparse GPs. Finally, we experimentally show that both algorithms exploit inter-base arm outcome correlation and vastly outperform the previous state-of-the-art UCB-based algorithms in realistic setups.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment and has been increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving. Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.

<title>Towards the Identifiability in Noisy Label Learning: A Multinomial Mixture Modelling Approach</title>

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels (LNL) is crucial in deep learning, in which one of the approaches is to identify clean-label samples from poorly-annotated datasets. Such an identification is challenging because the conventional LNL problem, which assumes only one noisy label per instance, is non-identifiable, i.e., clean labels cannot be estimated theoretically without additional heuristics. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach that addresses this issue without requiring any heuristics about clean samples. We discover that the LNL problem becomes identifiable if there are at least $2C - 1$ i.i.d. noisy labels per instance, where $C$ is the number of classes. Our finding relies on the assumption of i.i.d. noisy labels and multinomial mixture modelling, making it easier to interpret than previous studies that require full-rank noisy-label transition matrices. To fulfil this condition without additional manual annotations, we propose a method that automatically generates additional i.i.d. noisy labels through nearest neighbours. These noisy labels are then used in the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to infer clean labels. Our method demonstrably estimates clean labels accurately across various label noise benchmarks, including synthetic, web-controlled, and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the model trained with our method performs competitively with many state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To raise awareness of the environmental impact of deep learning (DL), many studies estimate the energy use of DL systems. However, energy estimates during DL training often rely on unverified assumptions. This work addresses that gap by investigating how model architecture and training environment affect energy consumption. We train a variety of computer vision models and collect energy consumption and accuracy metrics to analyze their trade-offs across configurations. Our results show that selecting the right model-training environment combination can reduce training energy consumption by up to 80.68% with less than 2% loss in $F_1$ score. We find a significant interaction effect between model and training environment: energy efficiency improves when GPU computational power scales with model complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that common estimation practices, such as using FLOPs or GPU TDP, fail to capture these dynamics and can lead to substantial errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Stable Training Epoch Projection (STEP) and the Pre-training Regression-based Estimation (PRE) methods. Across evaluations, our methods outperform existing tools by a factor of two or more in estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG uses a decoder to generate Boltzmann-distributed samples from simple latent variables, and a diffusion-based encoder to estimate the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of sampling tasks with complex target distributions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces Least Volume (LV)--a simple yet effective regularization method inspired by geometric intuition--that reduces the number of latent dimensions required by an autoencoder without prior knowledge of the dataset's intrinsic dimensionality. We show that its effectiveness depends on the Lipschitz continuity of the decoder, prove that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear special case, and demonstrate that LV induces a PCA-like importance ordering in nonlinear models. We extend LV to non-Euclidean settings as Generalized Least Volume (GLV), enabling the integration of label information into the latent representation. To support implementation, we also develop an accompanying Dynamic Pruning algorithm. We evaluate LV on several benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in dimension reduction. Leveraging this, we reveal the role of low-dimensional latent spaces in data sampling and disentangled representation, and use them to probe the varying topological complexity of various datasets. GLV is further applied to labeled datasets, where it induces a contrastive learning effect in representations of discrete labels. On a continuous-label airfoil dataset, it produces representations that lead to smooth changes in aerodynamic performance, thereby stabilizing downstream optimization.

Abstract: Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) reproduce common patterns in real-world graphs (e.g., power-law degrees, small diameters, and high clustering), (ii) generate variable (i.e., not overly similar) graphs, and (iii) remain tractable to compute and control graph statistics. A common class of RGMs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, so we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the output edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, the existence of each edge is assumed to be determined independently, for simplicity and tractability. However, with edge independency, RGMs provably cannot produce high subgraph densities and high output variability simultaneously. In this work, we explore RGMs beyond edge independence that can better reproduce common patterns while maintaining high tractability and variability. Theoretically, we propose an edge-dependent realization (i.e., sampling) framework called binding that provably preserves output variability, and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities. Practically, we propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. Our empirical results demonstrate that RGMs with binding exhibit high tractability and well reproduce common patterns, significantly improving upon edge-independent RGMs.

Abstract: Adaptive inference schemes reduce the cost of machine learning inference by assigning smaller models to easier examples, attempting to avoid invocation of larger models when possible. In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades.

Abstract: Scientific discovery catalyzes human intellectual advances, driven by the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimental design, evaluation, and assumption refinement. Central to this process is causal inference, uncovering the mechanisms behind observed phenomena. While randomized experiments provide strong inferences, they are often infeasible due to ethical or practical constraints. However, observational studies are prone to confounding or mediating biases. While crucial, identifying such backdoor paths is expensive and heavily depends on scientists' domain knowledge to generate hypotheses. We introduce a novel benchmark where the objective is to complete a partial causal graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels with over 4000 queries. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the backdoor variables between a cause and its effect. Unlike simple knowledge memorization of fixed associations, our task requires the LLM to reason according to the context of the entire graph.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous real-world applications. Being an unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD without label supervision. Despite a long list of available OD algorithms with tunable hyperparameters, the lack of systematic approaches for unsupervised algorithm and hyperparameter selection limits their effective use in practice. In this paper, we present FoMo-0D, a pre-trained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether. Having been pre-trained on synthetic data, FoMo-0D can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of test samples without parameter fine-tuning -- requiring no labeled data, and no additional training or hyperparameter tuning when given a new task. Extensive experiments on 57 real-world datasets against 26 baselines show that FoMo-0D is highly competitive; outperforming the majority of the baselines with no statistically significant difference from the 2nd best method. Further, FoMo-0D is efficient in inference time requiring only 7.7 ms per sample on average, with at least 7x speed-up compared to previous methods. To facilitate future research, our implementations for data synthesis and pre-training as well as model checkpoints are openly available at https://github.com/A-Chicharito-S/FoMo-0D.

Abstract: Neural network certification methods heavily rely on convex relaxations to provide robustness guarantees. However, these relaxations are often imprecise: even the most accurate single-neuron relaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a limitation known as the \emph{single-neuron convex barrier}. While multi-neuron relaxations have been heuristically applied to address this issue, two central questions arise: (i) whether they overcome the convex barrier, and if not, (ii) whether they offer theoretical capabilities beyond those of single-neuron relaxations. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of the expressiveness of multi-neuron relaxations. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that they are inherently incomplete, even when allocated sufficient resources to capture finitely many neurons and layers optimally. This result extends the single-neuron barrier to a \textit{universal convex barrier} for neural network certification. On the positive side, we show that completeness can be achieved by either (i) augmenting the network with a polynomial number of carefully designed ReLU neurons or (ii) partitioning the input domain into convex sub-polytopes, thereby distinguishing multi-neuron relaxations from single-neuron ones which are unable to realize the former and have worse partition complexity for the latter. Our findings establish a foundation for multi-neuron relaxations and point to new directions for certified robustness, including training methods tailored to multi-neuron relaxations and verification methods with multi-neuron relaxations as the main subroutine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce social biases, yet prevailing evaluations score models in isolation, obscuring how biases persist across families and releases. We introduce Bias Similarity Measurement (BSM), which treats fairness as a relational property between models, unifying scalar, distributional, behavioral, and representational signals into a single similarity space. Evaluating 30 LLMs on 1M+ prompts, we find that instruction tuning primarily enforces abstention rather than altering internal representations; small models gain little accuracy and can become less fair under forced choice; and open-weight models can match or exceed proprietary systems. Family signatures diverge: Gemma favors refusal, LLaMA 3.1 approaches neutrality with fewer refusals, and converges toward abstention-heavy behavior overall. Counterintuitively, Gemma 3 Instruct matches GPT-4-level fairness at far lower cost, whereas Gemini's heavy abstention suppresses utility. Beyond these findings, BSM offers an auditing workflow for procurement, regression testing, and lineage screening, and extends naturally to code and multilingual settings. Our results reframe fairness not as isolated scores but as comparative bias similarity, enabling systematic auditing of LLM ecosystems. Code available at https://github.com/HyejunJeong/bias_llm.

Abstract: Traditional theories of optimization cannot describe the dynamics of optimization in deep learning, even in the simple setting of deterministic training. The challenge is that optimizers typically operate in a complex, oscillatory regime called the "edge of stability." In this paper, we develop theory that can describe the dynamics of optimization in this regime. Our key insight is that while the *exact* trajectory of an oscillatory optimizer may be challenging to analyze, the *time-averaged* (i.e. smoothed) trajectory is often much more tractable. To analyze an optimizer, we derive a differential equation called a "central flow" that characterizes this time-averaged trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these central flows, we are able to understand how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers "adapt" to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards regions where they can take larger steps. Our results suggest that central flows can be a valuable theoretical tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.

Abstract: We propose the first method to show theoretical limitations for one-layer softmax transformers with arbitrarily many precision bits (even infinite). We establish those limitations for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match 3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all possible token triplets in an input sequence. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: function composition (Peng et al., 2024) and binary relations composition, respectively. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that, equipped with this mechanism, a one-layer transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. Importantly, we show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023), and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.

Abstract: Human language encompasses a wide range of intricate and diverse implicit features, which attackers can exploit to launch adversarial or backdoor attacks, compromising DNN models for NLP tasks. Existing model-oriented defenses often require substantial computational resources as model size increases, whereas sample-oriented defenses typically focus on specific attack vectors or schemes, rendering them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We observe that the root cause of both adversarial and backdoor attacks lies in the encoding process of DNN models, where subtle textual features, negligible for human comprehension, are erroneously assigned significant weight by less robust or trojaned models. Based on it we propose a unified and adaptive defense framework that is effective against both adversarial and backdoor attacks. Our approach leverages reformulation modules to address potential malicious features in textual inputs while preserving the original semantic integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing sample-oriented defense baselines across a diverse range of malicious textual features.

Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

Abstract: Multi-source transfer learning provides an effective solution to data scarcity in real- world supervised learning scenarios by leveraging multiple source tasks. In this field, existing works typically use all available samples from sources in training, which constrains their training efficiency and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that answers the question: what is the optimal quantity of source samples needed from each source task to jointly train the target model? Specifically, we introduce a generalization error measure based on K-L divergence, and minimize it based on high-dimensional statistical analysis to determine the optimal transfer quantity for each source task. Additionally, we develop an architecture-agnostic and data-efficient algorithm OTQMS to implement our theoretical results for target model training in multi- source transfer learning. Experimental studies on diverse architectures and two real-world benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and data efficiency. The code and supplementary materials are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Materials.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that structured machine learning models such as tree ensembles are vulnerable to privacy attacks targeting their training data. To mitigate these risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted countermeasure, as it offers rigorous privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a reconstruction attack targeting state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-DP random forests. By leveraging a constraint programming model that incorporates knowledge of the forest's structure and DP mechanism characteristics, our approach formally reconstructs the most likely dataset that could have produced a given forest. Through extensive computational experiments, we examine the interplay between model utility, privacy guarantees and reconstruction accuracy across various configurations. Our results reveal that random forests trained with meaningful DP guarantees can still leak portions of their training data. Specifically, while DP reduces the success of reconstruction attacks, the only forests fully robust to our attack exhibit predictive performance no better than a constant classifier. Building on these insights, we also provide practical recommendations for the construction of DP random forests that are more resilient to reconstruction attacks while maintaining a non-trivial predictive performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity, stemming from local non-IID data and global long-tailed distributions, is a major challenge in federated learning (FL), leading to significant performance gaps compared to centralized learning. Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.

Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.

Abstract: Accurate crop-type classification from satellite time series is essential for agricultural monitoring. While various machine learning algorithms have been developed to enhance performance on data-scarce tasks, their evaluation often lacks real-world scenarios. Consequently, their efficacy in challenging practical applications has not yet been profoundly assessed. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating supervised and SSL methods for crop-type classification under real-world conditions. This benchmark study relies on the EuroCropsML time-series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to supervised transfer learning and SSL methods. However, compared to simpler transfer learning, the improvement of meta-learning comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, supervised methods benefit most when pre-trained and fine-tuned on geographically close regions. In addition, while SSL generally lags behind meta-learning, it demonstrates advantages over training from scratch, particularly in capturing fine-grained features essential for real-world crop-type classification, and also surpasses standard transfer learning. This highlights its practical value when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce. Our insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational demand in selecting supervised machine learning methods for real-world crop-type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of knowledge transfer across diverse geographic regions. Furthermore, they demonstrate the practical value of SSL approaches when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit. In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave among the functionalities of language models.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), but they still face major challenges in synthesizing fine-grained emotional speech in an interpretable manner. Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities. Code and demos are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/UDDETTS.

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework introducing two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions, equipping the method with a fallback mechanism guaranteeing a performance lower bound even on non-fractal graphs. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61\%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional and latest baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 4\%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511/).

Abstract: Time series forecasting faces two important but often overlooked challenges. Firstly, the inherent random noise in the time series labels sets a theoretical lower bound for the forecasting error, which is positively correlated with the entropy of the labels. Secondly, neural networks exhibit a frequency bias when modeling the state-space of time series, that is, the model performs well in learning certain frequency bands but poorly in others, thus restricting the overall forecasting performance. To address the first challenge, we prove a theorem that there exists a unitary transformation that can reduce the marginal entropy of multiple correlated Gaussian processes, thereby providing guidance for reducing the lower bound of forecasting error. Furthermore, experiments confirm that Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can reduce the entropy in the majority of scenarios. Correspondingly, to alleviate the frequency bias, we jointly introduce supervision in the frequency domain along the temporal dimension through DFT and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). This supervision-side strategy is highly general and can be seamlessly integrated into any supervised learning method. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function named OLMA, which utilizes the frequency domain transformation across both channel and temporal dimensions to enhance forecasting. Finally, the experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OLMA in addressing the above two challenges and the resulting improvement in forecasting accuracy. The results also indicate that the perspectives of entropy and frequency bias provide a new and feasible research direction for time series forecasting. The code is available at: https://github.com/Yuyun1011/OLMA-One-Loss-for-More-Accurate-Time-Series-Forecasting.

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although many advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3\dots$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks researchers' view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on the Schr\"odingerisation method in quantum simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution mechanism in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement a Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, the $d+1$ dimensional evolving designs in our SKNO consistently outperform other baselines across ten benchmarks of increasing difficulty, ranging from the simple 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We also validate the resolution-invariance of SKNO on mixing-resolution training and zero-shot super-resolution tasks. In addition, we show the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is essential for long-term decision-making, particularly when the environment may differ from its specification. However, a significant gap exists in understanding the finite-sample complexity of these methods, as most existing work provides only asymptotic guarantees. This limitation hinders their principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited scenarios. We close this gap by proposing \textbf{Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)}, a new algorithm designed for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with transition uncertainty characterized by $\ell_p$-norm and contamination models. Our approach offers three key advantages over previous methods: (1). Weaker Structural Assumptions: RHI only requires the underlying robust MDP to be communicating, a less restrictive condition than the commonly assumed ergodicity or irreducibility; (2). No Prior Knowledge: Our algorithm operates without requiring any prior knowledge of the robust MDP; (3). State-of-the-Art Sample Complexity: To learn an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy, RHI achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result represents the tightest known bound. Our work hence provides essential theoretical understanding of sample efficiency of robust average reward RL.

Abstract: Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. We frame the problem as minimising the KL divergence between original and quantised model outputs under a model size constraint, which can be approximated by minimising the squared quantisation error, a well-studied problem where entropy-constrained quantisers with variable-length codes are optimal. We develop non-linear quantisation curves for block-scaled data across multiple distribution families and observe that these formats, along with sparse outlier formats, consistently outperform fixed-length formats, indicating that they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when applied to large language models.

Abstract: Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with traditional time-domain saliency.

<title>Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy</title>

Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast>1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on multimodal datasets with up to 15 modalities demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of additional modalities for selected samples compared with methods relying solely on unimodal information, entropy-based guidance, or random selection. We showcase the real-world relevance and scalability of our method by demonstrating its ability to effectively guide the costly acquisition of proteomics data for disease prediction in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank (UKBB). Our work provides an effective approach for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling more effective use of resources in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

<title>Bridging Arbitrary and Tree Metrics via Differentiable Gromov Hyperbolicity</title>

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

Abstract: Competing risks are crucial considerations in survival modelling, particularly in healthcare domains where patients may experience multiple distinct event types. We propose CRISP-NAM (Competing Risks Interpretable Survival Prediction with Neural Additive Models), an interpretable neural additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving feature-level interpretability. Each feature contributes independently to risk estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However, building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not the "lazy" projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates, allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two when necessary.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning.
  We are interested in the so-called ``robust'' setting, where the convergence guarantee does not depend on the minimal curvature of the potential function.
  While prior work has established convergence guarantees in this setting, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set, a condition that is both artificial and does not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such an assumption and present a refined analysis of TD learning. For the first time, we show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources, weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs' efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training pruning/quantization framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based loss found in OBC with a spike train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to prune or quantize synapses and analytically rescale the rest. Our experiments on models trained with neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) and large static datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet) show state-of-the-art results for one-shot post-training compression methods on SNNs, with single-digit to double-digit accuracy gains compared to OBC. SBC also approaches the accuracy of costly iterative methods, while cutting compression time by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept. This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the training loss. As a result, MCBMs yield more interpretable representations, support principled concept-level interventions, and remain consistent with probability-theoretic foundations.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity and supports diverse applications in neuroscience. While EEG foundation models (EFMs) have emerged to address the scalability issues of task-specific models, current approaches still yield clinically uninterpretable and weakly discriminative representations, inefficiently capture global dependencies, and neglect important local neural events. We present CodeBrain, a two-stage EFM designed to fill this gap. In the first stage, we introduce the TFDual-Tokenizer, which decouples heterogeneous temporal and frequency EEG signals into discrete tokens, quadratically expanding the representation space to enhance discriminative power and offering domain-specific interpretability by suggesting potential links to neural events and spectral rhythms. In the second stage, we propose the multi-scale EEGSSM architecture, which combines structured global convolution with sliding window attention to efficiently capture both sparse long-range and local dependencies, reflecting the brain's small-world topology. Pretrained on the largest public EEG corpus, CodeBrain achieves strong generalization across 8 downstream tasks and 10 datasets under distribution shifts, supported by comprehensive ablations, scaling-law analyses, and interpretability evaluations. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data-stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation-further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains on challenging real-world datasets with substantial covariate shift, supported by t-SNE visualizations highlighting our interpolation method.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied five machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. Overall, our findings show that Random Forest with A2 copula oversampling (theta = 10) achieved the best performance, with improvements of 5.3% in accuracy, 9.5% in precision, 5.7% in recall, 7.6% in F1-score, and 1.1% in AUC compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar's test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability and the exact convex polytope representations. We show that it results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and cheaply-computable confidence/reliability measures for both the model inputs and the outputs. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a broad set of synthetic and real-world problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of important La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and necessitate a middleware layer that adapts FL to distributional shifts. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED produces curricula that improve zero-shot generalization over strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the transition-prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that Co-Learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition-prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based RCMDP setting. In addition to the RCMDP setting, the paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

<title>Blending Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Prefix Sampling</title>

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

<title>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</title>

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<title>Training-Free Stein Diffusion Guidance: Posterior Correction for Sampling Beyond High-Density Regions</title>

Abstract: Training free diffusion guidance provides a flexible way to leverage off-the-shelf classifiers without additional training. Yet, current approaches hinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield unreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal control (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is prohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the strengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a novel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We establish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the necessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true diffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between approximate and true posteriors. By incorporating a principled Stein correction mechanism and a novel running cost functional, SDG enables effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on molecular low-density sampling tasks suggest that SDG consistently surpasses standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader diffusion-based sampling beyond high-density regions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for black-box optimization, but its application to high-dimensional permutation spaces is severely limited by the challenge of defining scalable representations. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on an exhaustive $\Omega(n^2)$ pairwise comparison, inducing a dense representation that is impractical for large-scale permutations. To break this barrier, we introduce a novel framework for generating efficient permutation representations via kernel functions derived from sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from enumeration sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} , which leverages the divide-and-conquer structure of merge sort to produce a compact, $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity with no information loss and effectively capture permutation structure. Our central thesis is that the Merge Kernel performs competitively with the Mallows kernel in low-dimensional settings, but significantly outperforms it in both optimization performance and computational efficiency as the dimension $n$ grows. Extensive evaluations on various permutation optimization benchmarks confirm our hypothesis, demonstrating that the Merge Kernel provides a scalable and more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional permutation spaces, thereby unlocking the potential for tackling previously intractable problems such as large-scale feature ordering and combinatorial neural architecture search.

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The implementation is readily available at: \href{https://github.com/itay1551/ParallelTime}{GitHub}.

Abstract: We propose the State Space Neural Operator (SS-NO), a compact architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation extends structured state space models (SSMs) to joint spatiotemporal modeling, introducing two key mechanisms: adaptive damping, which stabilizes learning by localizing receptive fields, and learnable frequency modulation, which enables data-driven spectral selection. These components provide a unified framework for capturing long-range dependencies with parameter efficiency. Theoretically, we establish connections between SSMs and neural operators, proving a universality theorem for convolutional architectures with full field-of-view. Empirically, SS-NO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks-including 1D Burgers' and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows-while using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches. A factorized variant of SS-NO further demonstrates scalable performance on challenging 2D problems. Our results highlight the effectiveness of damping and frequency learning in operator modeling, while showing that lightweight factorization provides a complementary path toward efficient large-scale PDE learning.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables stable sample reuse over multiple epochs by employing a policy gradient clipping mechanism tailored for RPG. It is further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and remains fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time causal model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer $\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.

<title>Breaking the Exploration Bottleneck: Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning for General LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available at https://github.com/IANNXANG/RuscaRL.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization skills and reasoning skills. By training MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss from downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active FLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve higher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP): memorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit from optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither reinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute alters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be determined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of compute-optimal scaling. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long-horizon rollout of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories. Finally, with only 10 solver steps' worth of augmented stencil data, our approach outperforms traditional ML emulators trained on thousands of trajectories in long-horizon rollout accuracy and stability.

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

<title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs. Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: Developing accurate, data-efficient surrogate models is central to advancing AI for Science. Neural operators (NOs), which approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using conventional neural architectures, have gained popularity as surrogates for systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their reliance on large datasets and limited ability to generalize in low-data regimes hinder their practical utility. We argue that these limitations arise from their global processing of data, which fails to exploit the local, discretized structure of physical systems. To address this, we propose Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) as a principled surrogate modeling paradigm for time-dependent PDEs. GNS leverages message-passing combined with numerical time-stepping schemes to learn PDE dynamics by modeling the instantaneous time derivatives. This design mimics traditional numerical solvers, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts and strong inductive biases that enhance generalization. We rigorously evaluate GNS on four canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D scalar Burgers', (2) 2D coupled Burgers', (3) 2D Allen-Cahn, and (4) 2D nonlinear shallow-water equations, comparing against state-of-the-art NOs including Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Results demonstrate that GNS is markedly more data-efficient, achieving less than 1% relative L2 error using only 3% of available trajectories, and exhibits dramatically reduced error accumulation over time (82.5% lower autoregressive error than FNO, 99.9% lower than DeepONet). To choose the training data, we introduce a PCA combined with KMeans trajectory selection strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that GNS, with its graph-based locality and solver-inspired design, is the most suitable and scalable surrogate modeling framework for AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network reasoning and generalization; models must decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment), a simple encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction ($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit and probing experiments, we reveal how ALICE progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common human strategies -- early layers place greater emphasis on letter frequencies, while later layers form word-level structures. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods are applicable beyond cryptograms and offer new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task decision-making, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in their underlying complexities. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling a broad and diverse suite of tasks, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two complementary perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, to mitigate the gradient conflicts, we systematically investigate key architectural designs for extending UniZero. Our investigation identifies a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture as the most effective approach. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that this architecture alleviates gradient conflicts by routing task-specific representations to specialized sub-networks. This finding leads to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically allocate model capacity throughout the learning process, we introduce an online Dynamic Parameter Scaling (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Evaluations on a diverse set of standard benchmarks (Atari, DMC, Jericho) demonstrate that ScaleZero, utilizing solely online reinforcement learning with one model, performs on par with specialized single-task agents. With the DPS strategy, it remains competitive while using just 71.5% of the environment interactions. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective multi-task planning. Our code is available at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.

Abstract: The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations, the overall effect size across the entire population is small. Then, the focus naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. Our design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions. Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity and experiments in practical scenarios demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the approach.

Abstract: Large language models frequently generate confident but incorrect outputs, requiring formal uncertainty quantification with abstention guarantees. We develop information-lift certificates that compare model probabilities to a skeleton baseline, accumulating evidence into sub-gamma PAC-Bayes bounds valid under heavy-tailed distributions. Across eight datasets, our method achieves 77.2\% coverage at 2\% risk, outperforming recent 2023-2024 baselines by 8.6-15.1 percentage points, while blocking 96\% of critical errors in high-stakes scenarios vs 18-31\% for entropy methods. Limitations include skeleton dependence and frequency-only (not severity-aware) risk control, though performance degrades gracefully under corruption.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

This study presents a novel, data-driven analysis of male domestic violence (MDV) in Bangladesh, highlighting the factors that influence it and addressing the challenges posed by a significant categorical imbalance of 5:1 and limited data availability. We collected data from nine major cities in Bangladesh and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying dynamics. EDA revealed patterns such as the high prevalence of verbal abuse, the influence of financial dependency, and the role of familial and socio-economic factors in MDV. To predict and analyze MDV, we implemented 10 traditional machine learning (ML) models, three deep learning models, and two ensemble models, including stacking and hybrid approaches. We propose a stacking ensemble model with ANN and CatBoost as base classifiers and Logistic Regression as the meta-model, which demonstrated the best performance, achieving $95\%$ accuracy, a $99.29\%$ AUC, and balanced metrics across evaluation criteria. Model-specific feature importance analysis of the base classifiers identified key features influencing their decision-making. Model-agnostic explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, provided both local and global insights into the decision-making processes of the proposed model, thereby increasing transparency and interpretability. Statistical validation using paired $t$-tests with 10-fold cross-validation and Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.0036$) confirmed the superior performance of our proposed model over alternatives. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that domestic abuse primarily affects women, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions and support systems for male victims.

Abstract: Timely detection of problematic research is essential for safeguarding scientific integrity. To explore whether social media commentary can serve as an early indicator of potentially problematic articles, this study analysed 3,815 tweets referencing 604 retracted articles and 3,373 tweets referencing 668 comparable non-retracted articles. Tweets critical of the articles were identified through both human annotation and large language models (LLMs). Human annotation revealed that 8.3% of retracted articles were associated with at least one critical tweet prior to retraction, compared to only 1.5% of non-retracted articles, highlighting the potential of tweets as early warning signals of retraction. However, critical tweets identified by LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) only partially aligned with human annotation, suggesting that fully automated monitoring of post-publication discourse should be applied with caution. A human-AI collaborative approach may offer a more reliable and scalable alternative, with human expertise helping to filter out tweets critical of issues unrelated to the research integrity of the articles. Overall, this study provides insights into how social media signals, combined with generative AI technologies, may support efforts to strengthen research integrity.

Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507). These findings highlight DGSP-GCN's effectiveness in evaluating and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks, offering valuable insights for network evolution and anomaly detection research.

Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.

Abstract: Identifying reaction conditions that are broadly applicable across diverse substrates is a longstanding challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical research. While many methods are available to generate conditions with acceptable performance, a universal approach for reliably discovering effective conditions during reaction exploration is rare. Consequently, current reaction optimization processes are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, relying heavily on trial-and-error experimentation. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design and chemical reasoning tasks. Here, we report the design, implementation and application of Chemma-RC, a text-augmented multimodal LLM to identify effective conditions through task-specific dialogue and condition generation. Chemma-RC learns a unified representation of chemical reactions by aligning multiple modalities-including text corpus, reaction SMILES, and reaction graphs-within a shared embedding module. Performance benchmarking on datasets showed high precision in identifying optimal conditions, with up to 17% improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction was investigated experimentally to evaluate the functionalities of the Chemma-RC in practice. Our findings suggest that Chemma-RC holds significant potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) extends recognition beyond fixed taxonomies by aligning visual and textual features, as in MDETR, GLIP, or RegionCLIP. While effective, these models require updating all parameters of large vision--language backbones, leading to prohibitive training cost. Recent efficient OVD approaches, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or adapters, reduce trainable parameters but often face challenges in selecting which layers to adapt and in balancing efficiency with accuracy. We propose UniProj-Det, a lightweight modular framework for parameter-efficient OVD. UniProj-Det freezes pretrained backbones and introduces a Universal Projection module with a learnable modality token, enabling unified vision--language adaptation at minimal cost. Applied to MDETR, our framework trains only about ~2-5% of parameters while achieving competitive or superior performance on phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation. Comprehensive analysis of FLOPs, memory, latency, and ablations demonstrates UniProj-Det as a principled step toward scalable and efficient open-vocabulary detection.

Abstract: The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.

<title>Scaling Laws for Online Advertisement Retrieval</title>

Abstract: The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has significantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws hold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent research increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or Transformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation. However, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online advertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling law for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and training resources for industrial applications, and 2) varying settings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied across various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight paradigm to identify online scaling laws of retrieval models, incorporating a novel offline metric and an offline simulation algorithm. We prove that under mild assumptions, the correlation between the novel metric and online revenue asymptotically approaches 1 and empirically validates its effectiveness. The simulation algorithm can estimate the machine cost offline. Based on the lightweight paradigm, we can identify online scaling laws for retrieval models almost exclusively through offline experiments, and quickly estimate machine costs and revenues for given model configurations. We further validate the existence of scaling laws across mainstream model architectures (e.g., Transformer, MLP, and DSSM) in our real-world advertising system. With the identified scaling laws, we demonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and multi-scenario resource allocation in the online advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study identification and application of online scaling laws for online advertisement retrieval.

arXiv:2412.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multiple agents are increasingly combined to make decisions with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the decisions they make together outperform those made individually. However, knowing how to improve the performance of collaborating agents requires knowing what information and strategies each agent employs. With a focus on human-AI pairings, we contribute a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information. By defining complementary information, our approach identifies opportunities for agents to better exploit available information in AI-assisted decision workflows. We present a novel explanation technique (ILIV-SHAP) that adapts SHAP explanations to highlight human-complementing information. We validate the effectiveness of ACIV and ILIV-SHAP through a study of human-AI decision-making, and demonstrate the framework on examples from chest X-ray diagnosis and deepfake detection. We find that presenting ILIV-SHAP with AI predictions leads to reliably greater reductions in error over non-AI assisted decisions more than vanilla SHAP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may have an important role to play in mental health by facilitating the quantification of verbal expressions used to communicate emotions, feelings and thoughts. While there has been substantial and very promising work in this area, the fundamental limits are uncertain. Here, focusing on depressive symptoms, we outline and evaluate LLM performance on three critical tests. The first test evaluates LLM performance on a novel ground-truth dataset from a large human sample (n=770). This dataset is novel as it contains both standard clinically validated quantifications of depression symptoms and specific verbal descriptions of the thoughts related to each symptom by the same individual. The performance of LLMs on this richly informative data shows an upper bound on the performance in this domain, and allow us to examine the extent to which inference about symptoms generalises. Second, we test to what extent the latent structure in LLMs can capture the clinically observed patterns. We train supervised sparse auto-encoders (sSAE) to predict specific symptoms and symptom patterns within a syndrome. We find that sSAE weights can effectively modify the clinical pattern produced by the model, and thereby capture the latent structure of relevant clinical variation. Third, if LLMs correctly capture and quantify relevant mental states, then these states should respond to changes in emotional states induced by validated emotion induction interventions. We show that this holds in a third experiment with 190 participants. Overall, this work provides foundational insights into the quantification of pathological mental states with LLMs, highlighting hard limits on the requirements of the data underlying LLM-based quantification; but also suggesting LLMs show substantial conceptual alignment.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.

Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at https://github.com/ajd12342/paraspeechcaps .

Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand -- raising concerns about trust, oversight, safety, and human dignity when they are integrated into software products. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a large-scale experiment with 124 participants, we explored how developers approach providing end-user explanations, including what challenges they face, and to what extent specific policies can guide their actions. We investigated whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations and provide evidence for policy compliance for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations and comply with the provided policies. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the nature and specificity of policy guidance had little effect. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.

Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.

<title>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models are released at Hugging Face and ModelScope.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

<title>Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping</title>

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

<title>CONSIGN: Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.

<title>Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion/flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic multilayer networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

<title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by moving illicit funds into the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets (original image, instruction, edited image), yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approx. 2.6x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit, an open dataset of 720k high-quality triplets, curated at industrial scale via millions of guided generations and validator passes, and we analyze the pipeline's stage-wise survival rates, providing a framework for estimating computational effort across different model stacks. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned Bagel model with state-of-the-art metrics.

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent works have begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, abstract representations of motion between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Vision-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. We demonstrate that villa-X can generate latent action plans in a zero-shot fashion, even for unseen embodiments and open-vocabulary symbolic understanding. This capability enables villa-X to achieve superior performance across diverse simulation tasks in SIMPLER and on two real-world robotic setups involving both gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. These results establish villa-X as a principled and scalable paradigm for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. We believe it provides a strong foundation for future research.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify whether a given output truly originates from the certified model. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider itself may act adversarially, replacing the certified model with a cheaper or lower-quality substitute. To our knowledge, this is the first work to study fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. Our approach introduces a trusted verifier that, during a certification phase, extracts hidden fingerprints from the authentic model's output space and trains a detector to recognize them. During verification, this detector can determine whether new outputs are consistent with the certified model, without requiring specialized hardware or model modifications. In extensive experiments, our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR on both GANs and diffusion models, and remain effective even against subtle architectural or training changes. Furthermore, the approach is robust to adaptive adversaries that actively manipulate outputs in an attempt to evade detection.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ and trims the memory footprint to a few tenths of that required for the full context, but also delivers performance comparable to or superior to the full-context setup in long-context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Text-guided sound separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.

Abstract: We study whether 3D self-supervised pretraining with Point--JEPA enables label-efficient grasp joint-angle prediction. Meshes are sampled to point clouds and tokenized; a ShapeNet-pretrained Point--JEPA encoder feeds a $K{=}5$ multi-hypothesis head trained with winner-takes-all and evaluated by top--logit selection. On a multi-finger hand dataset with strict object-level splits, Point--JEPA improves top--logit RMSE and Coverage@15$^{\circ}$ in low-label regimes (e.g., 26% lower RMSE at 25% data) and reaches parity at full supervision, suggesting JEPA-style pretraining is a practical lever for data-efficient grasp learning.

Summary: 
SAM-BG is a two-stage framework designed to improve the accuracy and interpretability of psychiatric diagnoses by learning brain graph representations with preserved structural semantics. The framework consists of a pre-training stage where an edge masker captures key structural semantics from a small labeled subset, and a self-supervised learning stage where this knowledge guides a structure-aware augmentation process for more meaningful representations. Experiments on real-world psychiatric datasets show that SAM-BG outperforms existing methods, especially in settings with limited labeled data, and reveals clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

Summary:
In this study, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework for symbolic regression is proposed to address limitations in traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction. The key innovations include an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions and evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover. These enhancements lead to improved search efficiency, robustness, and performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions. A thorough numerical study evaluates the impact of these improvements and benchmarks the approach against existing methods on various datasets. The results demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries, achieving a favorable balance between accuracy and model complexity on the Pareto frontier. The code for the proposed approach is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

Summary:
This paper introduces Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel framework for offline reinforcement learning that incorporates frequency-domain features to address the issue of trajectory instability caused by shifts in low-frequency components. By employing Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories and Short-Time Fourier Transform with cross attention mechanisms to extract and facilitate cross-frequency interaction, WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift and improves decision-making performance. Experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser outperforms existing methods by producing smoother, more stable trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by refining their capabilities.

Summary: DeepACTIF is a lightweight feature attribution method designed for interpreting deep learning models in time-series domains, particularly suited for real-time applications such as healthcare and human-AI interaction. By leveraging internal activations of LSTM-based networks, DeepACTIF efficiently estimates feature importance using an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasizes stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Evaluation on three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction and outperforms established methods like SHAP and IG in terms of accuracy and robustness. Through experiments, DeepACTIF is shown to reduce computation time and memory usage significantly while maintaining model accuracy with only the top-ranked features. This makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models, particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently. Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top 10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods, including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors.

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial oversight and risk management.

Summary: The article critically evaluates the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in hallucination detection, particularly focusing on their performance on the RAGTruth dataset. It is found that the high performance of SOTA methods is primarily due to a spurious correlation with the data. When this effect is controlled for, SOTA methods do not outperform supervised linear probes, necessitating extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. The analysis also reveals that out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, as all methods studied perform close to random in this regard. The article proposes a set of guidelines for both hallucination detection and its evaluation, highlighting the need for improved methods that can overcome current limitations in detecting and addressing hallucinations effectively. <div>

Out-of-distribution generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods performing close to random.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in expressing uncertainty, particularly in high-stakes domains like clinical diagnostics. Traditional methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities often lead to overconfidence and poor calibration. In this study, the authors propose an approach using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to address these issues. By treating LLMs as stochastic simulators and inferring posterior distributions over predictive probabilities, the ABC approach significantly improves accuracy (up to 46.9%) and reduces Brier scores by 74.4%. The method also enhances calibration, as demonstrated by improvements in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy. Evaluation on synthetic oral lesion diagnosis and a symptom-to-diagnosis dataset further validates the effectiveness of the ABC approach in improving the reliability and performance of LLMs in clinical settings.

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference, based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors focus on addressing temporal failures in RAG systems using two different methods applied to cybersecurity data. The first method involved a simple recency prior, which successfully achieved a high accuracy of 1.00 on freshness tasks. This result indicates the effectiveness of using recency as a factor in addressing temporal failures. However, the second method, which utilized a clustering heuristic for topic evolution, did not perform as well, as it yielded a low F1-score of 0.08. This outcome suggests that detecting trends in cybersecurity data requires more advanced methods beyond simple heuristics. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering different approaches and strategies when dealing with temporal failures in RAG systems, especially in the context of cybersecurity data analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary:

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance, requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

<div> Low-Rank Adaptation, Transformers, TensLoRA, tensor-based adaptations, attention projections <br />
Summary: <br />
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is commonly used to enhance Transformers by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices into attention projections. However, existing methods treat these matrices as independent for each layer and projection, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, the authors propose TensLoRA, a unified framework that combines LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, allowing for a wide range of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. This approach offers mode-specific compression rates, enabling customization of parameter budgets based on modality and task. Experimental results on vision and language tasks demonstrate that the tensor construction significantly impacts performance, sometimes outperforming standard LoRA with similar parameter counts. TensLoRA provides a more versatile and efficient way to adapt Transformers, yielding improved results in various scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

<div> adaptive patch embedding, temporal heterogeneity, segment-wise decoding, multivariate time series forecasting, TimeMosaic

Summary:

The article introduces TimeMosaic, a novel framework for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses the issue of temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic utilizes adaptive patch embedding to adjust granularity based on local information density, balancing motif reuse and structural clarity while maintaining temporal continuity. It also implements segment-wise decoding, treating each prediction horizon as a separate subtask to adapt to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, TimeMosaic outperforms existing methods and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art TSFMs when trained on a large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations. The framework's innovative approach to capturing the diverse complexities of short-term and long-term forecasting horizons makes it a promising tool for various domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Summary:<br />
This study compares three techniques, SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, for credit default prediction, addressing the class imbalance issue. ML models were evaluated on imbalanced data to establish baseline performance before resampling. Ensemble boosting algorithms like XGBoost, AdaBoost, GBM, and Light GBM were tested with Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection. The Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier showed the best performance (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in credit default prediction. This study lays the groundwork for enhancing credit default systems adaptability in the rising global credit market. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques, namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

Summary:
- The study examines uncertainty quantification in statistical and deep learning models for electricity price forecasting in the German market.
- Models include deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) augmented with ensemble methods and conformal prediction, as well as LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) models with various techniques.
- LEAR-based models show strong performance in probabilistic forecasting regardless of the uncertainty quantification method used.
- DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, leading to improvements in point and probabilistic forecasting.
- Models using conformal prediction demonstrate the best capture of uncertainty.
Summary:<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

<div> sensitivity, distributional shifts, verification methodology, risk assessment, deep learning systems
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel methodology for evaluating and assessing the risks of deep learning systems, which are often sensitive to minor shifts in input data known as distributional shifts. These shifts, common in real-world scenarios, are not typically considered during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. The proposed approach estimates the probability of distributional shifts at runtime using out-of-distribution detectors and combines this with network correctness probabilities in a binary tree structure for accurate accuracy estimation. Tested on five datasets with varying distributional shift frequencies, the approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation methods with small estimation errors. In a medical segmentation benchmark, the approach demonstrates potential for risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses. This approach aims to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study introduces a novel approach, THINNs, for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems. By using a physically informed penalization strategy based on a large deviations principle, improbable deviations are penalized, leading to a thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems, we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established penalization strategies.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DELTAformer, a new method for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data to address scalability and performance issues. DELTAformer utilizes delegate tokens to constrain inter-variable mixing, improving signal focus and noise-resilience. The method scales linearly with variable count, outperforming standard transformers and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks. By strategically incorporating domain-specific challenges, DELTAformer demonstrates superior performance in noisy MTS environments, showcasing improved noise-resilience compared to standard transformers. The model's selective information propagation enhances signal relevance and overall effectiveness in MTS data analysis. Through effective constraint of inter-variable modeling, DELTAformer simultaneously improves scalability and performance, highlighting the potential for domain-specific design considerations to enhance transformer models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Summary:
The study introduces a frame-based diffusion paradigm for molecular generation that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance. Three variants are investigated: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD). By incorporating EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9 dataset. The results demonstrate high validity and uniqueness, with faster sampling compared to other methods. This approach maintains atom stability of 98.98% and molecular stability of 90.51%, outperforming equivariant baselines. The study highlights the importance of global structure preservation in molecular generation and establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm. <div>

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

<br />
Summary: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) introduces a new method for learning dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Unlike neural surrogates that can destabilize long-horizon rollouts, MCFM incorporates a conservative-dissipative split into the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. By training via conditional flow matching on short transitions, MCFM avoids the need for long rollout adjoints. During inference, a Strang-prox scheme ensures discrete energy decay through alternating symplectic updates and proximal metric steps. Additionally, an optional projection can enforce strict decay when trusted energy information is available. Continuous and discrete time guarantees connect MCFM's parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. In experiments on a mechanical benchmark, MCFM produces phase portraits closer to ground truth and exhibits fewer instances of energy increase and positive energy rate events compared to unconstrained neural flows, while maintaining a comparable fit to the terminal distribution. <div>

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

<div> Diffusion-based world models, offline reinforcement learning, TD learning, DAWM, inverse dynamics model
Summary:<br /><br />Diffusion-based world models have shown promise in generating realistic trajectories for offline RL but struggle with action generation. The proposed DAWM model addresses this limitation by incorporating actions into the trajectory generation process alongside states and rewards. This allows for compatibility with one-step TD-based offline RL algorithms. DAWM utilizes an inverse dynamics model for efficient action inference, leading to complete synthetic transitions that benefit conservative offline RL algorithms like TD3BC and IQL. Empirical results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of DAWM, with improved performance over existing diffusion-based baselines across various tasks. This modular design enhances training efficiency and enables better utilization of generated trajectories for offline RL algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Summary: This thesis delves into how deep learning models learn over time by incorporating ideas from force analysis. By examining the interactions between training examples akin to forces moving objects, the study breaks down the influence into the similarity of examples and the strength of the updating force. This framework helps elucidate various behaviors of the model in different systems, such as understanding complex learning paths, explaining the efficacy of certain finetuning methods, and recognizing the tendency for simpler patterns to be learned more readily. The application of this approach to diverse learning tasks uncovers novel strategies for enhancing model training, offering a systematic and evolving method for interpreting model behaviors. <div>

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work, and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

arXiv:2509.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules' input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

Summary:
Machine learning is used to predict the success of reformatting antibodies from one format to another. The framework considers sequence, structure, and realistic deployment scenarios. Surprisingly, large pretrained protein language models do not outperform simple, domain-tailored representations, especially in challenging scenarios with new antibodies. The best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, allowing for the prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple, domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario, our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new approach, von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss, for deep hashing in time series data indexing. The proposed method aims to reduce information loss by mapping data to a hyperspherical space and modeling each data class with distinct vMF distributions. This allows for better separation between semantically different data samples, improving search and retrieval efficiency. The vMF hashing loss outperforms existing baselines in experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating compact binary representations for time series data. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available to facilitate further research and application in time series data mining. <div>
arXiv:2509.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

<div> spectrum scaling, state-space models, attention mechanism, Transformer models, language modeling<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of the Mamba architecture in handling long-context inputs, attributing it to the out-of-distribution behavior of its state-space dynamics and the structure of its state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike previous explanations focusing on the accumulation of discretization time steps, the authors link the model's sensitivity to context length extension to the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. To address this issue, they propose a spectrum scaling approach to selectively modulate the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer of pre-trained Mamba models. This technique demonstrates significant improvements in long-context generalization performance, providing a new perspective on enhancing state-space models for better handling of extended context lengths.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.

Summary:<br />
Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a challenging task due to scarcity of real data and temporal dependencies. The proposed TIMED framework integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a supervisor network for autoregressive dependencies, and a Wasserstein critic for temporal smoothness. It also includes a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss for feature space alignment. All components are optimized for sequence modeling and trained jointly to capture unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results show that TIMED outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating realistic and coherent sequences across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Spatial Structured Attention Block for global station weather forecasting. This method addresses the limitation of existing time series forecasting methods by incorporating spatial correlation modeling. It partitions the spatial graph into subgraphs and utilizes both Intra-subgraph Attention and Inter-subgraph Attention to learn and represent local spatial correlation while considering global correlation. By expanding subgraph scales, a scalable and structured multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model is developed. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 16.8% improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, with low running costs. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of global weather forecasting for various sectors such as energy, aviation, and agriculture.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful patterns from noisy time series data in digital health using self-supervised learning. The proposed framework incorporates a bag-of-symbol representation to account for data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors. This representation is advantageous as it is insensitive to data warping, location shifts, and noise. By being aware of these factors, the deep learning model can better generalize across significant data shifts. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in scenarios where data shifting is substantial. The study highlights the importance of considering data distribution shift in deep learning models for time series data analysis in digital health applications. <div>
arXiv:2509.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel approach for distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) focusing on numerical data. The method utilizes wavelet expansions to express sample distributions, with a priority on estimating low-order coefficients for accurate macroscopic level estimation. By preventing probability mass from being misplaced far away from the true distribution, the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods under Wasserstein and KS distances. The theoretical guarantees of the method are also established. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet expansion method in accurately estimating distributions while preserving privacy under LDP. <div>

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein and KS distances.

Summary: 
Machine learning models for Chest X-Ray (CXR) diagnosis, evaluated using prior discharge summaries to assess contextual knowledge available to clinicians, show better performance on cases with low pre-test probabilities compared to higher ones. The use of pre-test probability also helps distinguish true diagnostic signal from shortcut inference abilities, as evidenced by performance drops in a balanced test set without the shortcut. This analysis method, utilizing clinical context from discharge summaries, offers a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation approach for evaluating clinical vision models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

<div> Keywords: Federated continual learning, prompt-based methods, class-wise knowledge coherence, C${}^2$Prompt, task data<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated continual learning (FCL) deals with learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients. Existing prompt-based FCL methods face challenges related to class-wise knowledge coherence, leading to intra-class distribution gaps and inter-prompt class-wise relevance issues. To tackle these issues, the Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method is proposed. It includes a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) to reduce intra-class distribution disparities and a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) to enhance class-relevant knowledge aggregation during prompt communication. By explicitly addressing class-wise coherence, C${}^2$Prompt outperforms existing methods in FCL benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The source code for C${}^2$Prompt is publicly available for further research and applications. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
The article investigates the issue of Loss of Trainability (LoT) in continual learning and analyzes it through an optimization perspective. Traditional indicators like Hessian rank, sharpness level, and gradient norms are found to be unreliable predictors of LoT in Adam optimization. Instead, the study introduces two new criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that together form a per-layer predictive threshold. By using this threshold, a simple per-layer scheduler is developed to maintain effective step sizes within safe limits, thereby stabilizing training and enhancing accuracy across various methods including CReLU and regularization techniques. The learned learning-rate trajectories generated by this approach mirror standard decay patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling the trainability issue in continual learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2509.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios, and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Summary: 
The study focuses on training a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks without providing the model with normal equations or handcrafted iterations. The model learns to predict missing blocks, including scalar targets and unseen kernel slices for Nyström extrapolation, through input-output pairs and mean-squared loss. Surprisingly, the model uncovers a parameter-free update rule through algebraic unrolling, demonstrating second-order convergence on full-batch problems and reducing complexity in distributed iterations. The model remains accurate even with rank-limited attention and adapts to different computational regimes.

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss; it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation). We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a powerful capability of in-context learning.

<div> Keywords: surgical decision-making, individualized treatment effects, spinal fusion, scoliosis correction, multi-task meta-learning

Summary:
Surgical decision-making in complex procedures like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction requires accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs). Traditional statistical methods struggle with heterogeneous data, leading to limited accuracy. In this study, a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, is developed to model surgical decisions as distinct tasks while learning shared representations. The framework incorporates inverse probability weighting (IPW) to enhance causal validity. Evaluation on spinal fusion and scoliosis datasets demonstrates superior performance in estimating treatment effects and predicting patient-reported outcomes. The model achieves high AUC values, outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation, and provides robust patient-specific causal estimates. X-MultiTask has the potential to advance personalized surgical care, improve patient outcomes, and is available for use on GitHub.

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs. posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset (368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs. non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains, with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902. By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes.

Summary:  
This research introduces a novel method for noninvasively predicting arterial blood pressure (ABP) using speech signals. The traditional cuff-based methods for ABP monitoring can yield inconsistent results, but by leveraging the acoustic characteristics of speech and employing advanced deep learning techniques, this study successfully captures voice features to establish correlations with blood pressure levels. The model, based on BERT regression, achieved impressive performance metrics with mean absolute errors of 1.36 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 1.24 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The robustness of the model was demonstrated by high R-scores of 0.99 and 0.94 for SBP and DBP, respectively.

<br />
Summary: Frictional Q-learning is introduced as a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control tasks. Drawing an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, the algorithm incorporates a constraint to prevent the policy from drifting towards unsupported actions. By constraining the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer while maintaining a distance from the orthonormal action space manifold, the algorithm effectively addresses extrapolation error. This constraint, inspired by the concept of friction, simplifies the batch-constrained reinforcement learning approach and offers a physical interpretation of the error. Empirically, Frictional Q-learning demonstrates robust training and competitive performance on standard continuous control benchmarks. <br /><br /> <div>

Our algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

Summary:  
Sobolev training, a technique incorporating target derivatives in loss functions, has been proven to speed up convergence and enhance generalization in comparison to standard $L^2$ training. However, the precise mechanisms behind this method were not fully understood. This study establishes a theoretical framework demonstrating that Sobolev training quickens convergence in Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Using a student-teacher setup with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, the research provides exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, illustrating improved conditioning of the loss landscape and faster convergence rates via gradient flow. Extensive experiments confirm these theoretical results and demonstrate that the advantages of Sobolev training are applicable to contemporary deep learning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep learning tasks.

arXiv:2509.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis. Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world cardiovascular screening.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Tanbr for efficient online inference in Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models. Tanbr addresses the challenges of large model size and complex expert routing by estimating task distribution from historical data. It utilizes a binary tree to generate candidate merging weights, applying neural bandit to determine optimal expert merging. Tanbr achieves a sublinear regret bound of O(sqrt(T) log(T)) over T rounds, matching existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate Tanbr's effectiveness in reducing inference latency by 45% and memory usage by up to 25%, while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Tanbr's task-aware expert merging capability enhances online inference efficiency and reliability, making it a promising solution for real-time applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing, especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that \texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$}, while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
- Human drivers focus on a few agents at a time, while autonomous systems handle complex scenes with multiple agents.
- Existing attention mechanisms for agent interactions are computationally expensive due to their quadratic nature.
- RDAR proposes a strategy to learn per-agent relevance by identifying which agents impact the controlled vehicle's behavior.
- RDAR formulates the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process, where actions determine agent exclusion.
- Evaluation on a large driving dataset shows RDAR's ability to accurately measure relevance while processing fewer agents than state-of-the-art models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.

<div> Keywords: Policy-based reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning tasks, rollout-based reinforcement learning, difficulty levels, curriculum reinforcement learning.

Summary: 
Policy-based reinforcement learning techniques are vital for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based methods do not consider LLMs' learning ability across samples of varying difficulty levels. A new framework called VCRL is proposed, which adjusts the sample difficulty based on the variance of group rewards in reinforcement learning. Samples with moderate difficulty exhibit higher variance, indicating their suitability for training. Experimental results on multiple mathematical benchmarks and models demonstrate the superiority of VCRL over current LLM RL approaches. This approach aligns with the human cognitive process of solving mathematical problems starting from easy to difficult ones, enhancing the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter (CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate $O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a structured alternative to existing methods.

Summary:<br />
1. The study focuses on boreal forests, which store a significant amount of terrestrial carbon and are crucial for climate mitigation due to their vulnerability to permafrost thaw.
2. The researchers introduce BoreaRL, a multi-objective reinforcement learning environment designed for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, incorporating a simulator of energy, carbon, and water fluxes.
3. Carbon objectives are found to be easier to optimize compared to thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, highlighting the complexity of balancing these competing goals.
4. Different management strategies emerge from the analysis, with carbon-focused policies favoring high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies prioritize species composition and density to protect permafrost while maximizing carbon gains.
5. The study underscores the challenges in developing robust climate-adaptive forest management strategies using current multi-objective reinforcement learning methods, underscoring the need for further research in this area.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

Summary: 
- Symbolic regression algorithms use Transformer-based models to search for mathematical expressions that fit given data, reducing the need for expensive combinatorial searches. 
- The success of these models depends heavily on their pre-training data, with their ability to generalize to new problems largely unexplored. 
- A systematic study was conducted to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained transformer-based symbolic regression models, showing a significant gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. 
- While these models perform well within their pre-training data, their performance degrades in scenarios outside this distribution, limiting their practical applications in real-world problems. 
- The findings suggest that addressing this generalization gap is crucial to enhance the usability of pre-trained approaches for broader applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a method to address the challenge of unbalanced classification tasks in machine learning by distinguishing critical instances near the decision boundary from redundant samples in the core of the data distribution. The proposed boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score significantly on benchmark datasets, while the core-aware reduction method compresses datasets without sacrificing accuracy. This has implications for efficient model training, especially in computationally demanding domains like Large Language Model (LLM) training. The approach prioritizes decision-relevant data, leading to faster convergence, improved generalization, and substantial computational savings. The method can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to intelligent sampling for data-efficient learning and driving advancements in AI technologies. The code for the method is available as a Python package for easy implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\% on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is available as a Python package at https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-resampling/ .

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

<title>MCGrad:: Multicalibration at Web Scale</title>

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm. Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry. We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets. In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.

<title>PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models. The implementation is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.

<title>Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19901</link>

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

<title>Latent Iterative Refinement Flow: A Geometric-Constrained Approach for Few-Shot Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19903</link>

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling. Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss} $L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle, candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem} demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

<title>On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20 examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii) Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

<title>TABFAIRGDT: A Fast Fair Tabular Data Generator using Autoregressive Decision Trees</title>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.

<title>Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2509.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}.

<title>From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.

<title>Faster Than SVD, Smarter Than SGD: The OPLoRA Alternating Update</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine (LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

<title>RAD: Towards Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Multi-modal Clinical Diagnosis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters, neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover, recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis.

<title>Pi-Transformer: A Physics-informed Attention Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

<title>Learning Robust Penetration-Testing Policies under Partial Observability: A systematic evaluation</title>

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size, aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go beyond quantitative results.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making. However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks. Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs) under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition, and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained} optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution. We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process, yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

<title>An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity</title>

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process. The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset, FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline models to a considerable extent.

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular, but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets, highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical experiments.

<title>Q-Palette: Fractional-Bit Quantizers Toward Optimal Bit Allocation for Efficient LLM Deployment</title>

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Q-Palette.

<title>Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGMamba-ncRNA-94D0.

arXiv:2509.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200 billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8 GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day, similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains during the internet and cloud build-up.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.

<title>Extended Low-Rank Approximation Accelerates Learning of Elastic Response in Heterogeneous Materials</title>

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.

<title>When Judgment Becomes Noise: How Design Failures in LLM Judge Benchmarks Silently Undermine Validity</title>

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/judgment-to-noise-947D/README.md

<title>Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels</title>

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks, where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered. Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.

<title>Feature Dynamics as Implicit Data Augmentation: A Depth-Decomposed View on Deep Neural Network Generalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones. This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability. Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization, which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly, highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet, fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art models, achieving R2>0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise. Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of next-generation biomedical signal processing.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.

Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness. The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height. Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047 spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.

Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored, these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition without additional motion sensors.

Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks.

Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/EonHao/Holographic-Transformers.

Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.

Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.

Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling. However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead, limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases, coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial parameter selection.

Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup, resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.

Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality. While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.

Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term, monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392 annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening in extended EEG recordings.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.

Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.

Our evaluation demonstrates solid performance on simple queries, as well as directions for improvement, and provides insights for selecting evaluation metrics that are better fit for IYP querying AI agents.

Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.

Abstract: We test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) in astronomy by measuring representational convergence across a range of foundation models trained on different data types. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations from JWST, HSC, Legacy Survey, and DESI, we compare representations from vision transformers, self-supervised models, and astronomy-specific architectures via mutual $k$-nearest neighbour analysis. We observe consistent scaling: representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our tested architectures, supporting convergence toward a shared representation of galaxy astrophysics. Our results suggest that astronomical foundation models can use pre-trained general-purpose architectures, allowing us to capitalise on the broader machine learning community's already-spent computational investment.

Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/SEIL.git.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

Abstract: In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space $M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric, semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities, and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its checkpoints and training code on our project page.

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval pipelines.

<title>Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

<title>AnySafe: Adapting Latent Safety Filters at Runtime via Safety Constraint Parameterization in the Latent Space</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.

Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3 semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Abstract: Time series analysis has emerged as an important tool for improving patient diagnosis and management in healthcare applications. However, these applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.

Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and additional information can be found at https://ego-bridge.github.io

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust, scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation hyperspectral missions.

Abstract: Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening" to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance. Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Copulas are a fundamental tool for modelling multivariate dependencies in data, forming the method of choice in diverse fields and applications. However, the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on larger scales and more challenging domains.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of AI-assisted software development tools deployed at enterprise scale. Over one year, 300 engineers across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8% reduction in PR review cycle time.
  Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61% increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30 to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an overall 28% increase in code shipment volume.
  Unlike controlled benchmark evaluations, our longitudinal analysis provides empirical evidence from production environments, revealing both the transformative potential and practical deployment challenges of integrating AI into enterprise software development workflows.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

<title>Convex Regression with a Penalty</title>

Abstract: A common way to estimate an unknown convex regression function $f_0: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from a set of $n$ noisy observations is to fit a convex function that minimizes the sum of squared errors. However, this estimator is known for its tendency to overfit near the boundary of $\Omega$, posing significant challenges in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator of $f_0$ that avoids this overfitting by minimizing a penalty on the subgradient while enforcing an upper bound $s_n$ on the sum of squared errors. The key advantage of this method is that $s_n$ can be directly estimated from the data. We establish the uniform almost sure consistency of the proposed estimator and its subgradient over $\Omega$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and derive convergence rates. The effectiveness of our estimator is illustrated through its application to estimating waiting times in a single-server queue.

Abstract: We address the Statistical Process Control (SPC) of high-dimensional, dynamic industrial processes from two complementary perspectives: manifold fitting and manifold learning, both of which assume data lies on an underlying nonlinear, lower dimensional space. We propose two distinct monitoring frameworks for online or 'phase II' Statistical Process Control (SPC). The first method leverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately approximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient high-dimensional space. It then monitors deviations from this manifold using a novel scalar distribution-free control chart. In contrast, the second method adopts a more traditional approach, akin to those used in linear dimensionality reduction SPC techniques, by first embedding the data into a lower-dimensional space before monitoring the embedded observations. We prove how both methods provide a controllable Type I error probability, after which they are contrasted for their corresponding fault detection ability. Extensive numerical experiments on a synthetic process and on a replicated Tennessee Eastman Process show that the conceptually simpler manifold-fitting approach achieves performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, the more classical lower-dimensional manifold monitoring methods. In addition, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed manifold-fitting approach by successfully detecting surface anomalies in a real image dataset of electrical commutators.

Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.

<title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.

Abstract: Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is available at https://github.com/NicoSchulthess/anomalydino-dpmm.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates, creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Secure monitoring and dynamic control in an IIoT environment are major requirements for current development goals. We believe that dynamic, secure monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.

Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hyperspectraladapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.

Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game. Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game. This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned above.

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models~(LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

<title>Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar pipelines.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

Abstract: This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.

<title>Feeding Two Birds or Favoring One? Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

<title>Ads that Stick: Near-Optimal Ad Optimization through Psychological Behavior Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20304</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital advertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling policies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps, that overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users' long-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several psychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).
  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on three key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and operant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave function of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is modeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user interest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask the following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads should be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the ads?
  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of displayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the operant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm that outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the performance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small. Our algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and shows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many natural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on the mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a simple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings with experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various baselines.

We present a multi-scale statistical model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric estimation.

Abstract: Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at: https://visualmimic.github.io .

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of high-quality synthetic data -- generated by advanced AI models or collected as auxiliary data from related tasks -- presents both opportunities and challenges for statistical inference. This paper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that wraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample efficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages high-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults to the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of low quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing large reasoning models on complex math problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a vector-valued objective function $\boldsymbol{f}$ sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) whose index set is a well-behaved, compact metric space $({\cal X},d)$ of designs. We assume that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is not known beforehand and that evaluating $\boldsymbol{f}$ at design $x$ results in a noisy observation of $\boldsymbol{f}(x)$. Since identifying the Pareto optimal designs via exhaustive search is infeasible when the cardinality of ${\cal X}$ is large, we propose an algorithm, called Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL, that exploits the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of $({\cal X},d)$ to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations as possible. We provide both information-type and metric dimension-type bounds on the sample complexity of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set identification. We also experimentally show that our algorithm outperforms other Pareto set identification methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are predominantly developed for stationary environments, and the limited literature that considers nonstationary environments often involves specific assumptions about changes that can occur in transition probability matrices and reward functions. Considering that real-world applications involve environments that continuously evolve due to various external events, and humans make decisions by discerning patterns in historical events, this study investigates Markov Decision Processes under the influence of an external temporal process. We establish the conditions under which the problem becomes tractable, allowing it to be addressed by considering only a finite history of events, based on the properties of the perturbations introduced by the exogenous process. We propose and theoretically analyze a policy iteration algorithm to tackle this problem, which learns policies contingent upon the current state of the environment, as well as a finite history of prior events of the exogenous process. We show that such an algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. However, we provide a guarantee for policy improvement in regions of the state space determined by the approximation error induced by considering tractable policies and value functions. We also establish the sample complexity of least-squares policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms that consider approximations due to the incorporation of only a finite history of temporal events. While our results are applicable to general discrete-time processes satisfying certain conditions on the rate of decay of the influence of their events, we further analyze the case of discrete-time Hawkes processes with Gaussian marks. We performed experiments to demonstrate our findings for policy evaluation and deployment in traditional control environments.

Abstract: On tabular data, a significant body of literature has shown that current deep learning (DL) models perform at best similarly to Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), while significantly underperforming them on outlier data. However, these works often study idealized problem settings which may fail to capture complexities of real-world scenarios. We identify a natural tabular data setting where DL models can outperform GBDTs: tabular Learning-to-Rank (LTR) under label scarcity. Tabular LTR applications, including search and recommendation, often have an abundance of unlabeled data, and scarce labeled data. We show that DL rankers can utilize unsupervised pretraining to exploit this unlabeled data. In extensive experiments over both public and proprietary datasets, we show that pretrained DL rankers consistently outperform GBDT rankers on ranking metrics -- sometimes by as much as 38% -- both overall and on outliers.

Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.

Abstract: Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF. The code is available at https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/STELLA.

Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.

Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.

Abstract: Computational wave imaging (CWI) extracts hidden structure and physical properties of a volume of material by analyzing wave signals that traverse that volume. Applications include seismic exploration of the Earth's subsurface, acoustic imaging and non-destructive testing in material science, and ultrasound computed tomography in medicine. Current approaches for solving CWI problems can be divided into two categories: those rooted in traditional physics, and those based on deep learning. Physics-based methods stand out for their ability to provide high-resolution and quantitatively accurate estimates of acoustic properties within the medium. However, they can be computationally intensive and are susceptible to ill-posedness and nonconvexity typical of CWI problems. Machine learning-based computational methods have recently emerged, offering a different perspective to address these challenges. Diverse scientific communities have independently pursued the integration of deep learning in CWI. This review discusses how contemporary scientific machine-learning (ML) techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, have been developed to enhance and integrate with traditional physics-based methods for solving CWI problems.
  We present a structured framework that consolidates existing research spanning multiple domains, including computational imaging, wave physics, and data science. This study concludes with important lessons learned from existing ML-based methods and identifies technical hurdles and emerging trends through a systematic analysis of the extensive literature on this topic.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.

Abstract: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers expose hundreds of parameters that have an outsized impact on performance but are difficult to configure for all but expert users. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches require training on thousands of related instances, generalize poorly and can be difficult to integrate into existing solver workflows. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework that configures cutting plane separators using problem descriptions and solver-specific separator summaries. To reduce variance in LLM outputs, we introduce an ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates candidate configurations into a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our method requires no custom solver interface, generates configurations in seconds via simple API calls, and requires solving only a small number of instances. Extensive experiments on standard synthetic and real-world MILPs show our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art configuration methods with a fraction of the data and computation.

<title>Representation Convergence: Mutual Distillation is Secretly a Form of Regularization</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that mutual distillation between reinforcement learning policies serves as an implicit regularization, preventing them from overfitting to irrelevant features. We highlight two separate contributions: (i) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (ii) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Ultimately, we do not claim to achieve state-of-the-art performance but rather focus on uncovering the underlying principles of generalization and deepening our understanding of its mechanisms.

<title>Increasing Batch Size Improves Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum</title>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), in which a momentum term is added to SGD, has been well studied in both theory and practice. The theoretical studies show that the settings of the learning rate and momentum weight affect the convergence of SGDM. Meanwhile, the practical studies have shown that the batch-size setting strongly affects the performance of SGDM. In this paper, we focus on mini-batch SGDM with a constant learning rate and constant momentum weight, which is frequently used to train deep neural networks. We show theoretically that using a constant batch size does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss in training a deep neural network, whereas using an increasing batch size definitely minimizes it; that is, an increasing batch size improves the convergence of mini-batch SGDM. We also provide numerical results supporting our analyses, indicating specifically that mini-batch SGDM with an increasing batch size converges to stationary points faster than with a constant batch size, while also reducing computational cost. Python implementations of the optimizers used in the numerical experiments are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/NSHB_increasing_batchsize_acml25/.

<title>Bias-variance decompositions: the exclusive privilege of Bregman divergences</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18581</link>

Abstract: Bias-variance decompositions are widely used to understand the generalization performance of machine learning models. While the squared error loss permits a straightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or $L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely on definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and variance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved for the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a special case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these decompositions remain an open question.
  In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative loss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles (zero loss if and only if the two arguments are identical), under mild regularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman divergences are the only such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A $g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence through an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis distance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss function with a clean bias-variance decomposition. Consequently, common metrics such as $0$-$1$ and $L_1$ losses cannot admit a clean bias-variance decomposition, explaining why previous attempts have failed. We also examine the impact of relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our results.

<title>Compact Rule-Based Classifier Learning via Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Rule-based models are essential for high-stakes decision-making due to their transparency and interpretability, but their discrete nature creates challenges for optimization and scalability. In this work, we present the Fuzzy Rule-based Reasoner (FRR), a novel gradient-based rule learning system that supports strict user constraints over rule-based complexity while achieving competitive performance. To maximize interpretability, the FRR uses semantically meaningful fuzzy logic partitions, unattainable with existing neuro-fuzzy approaches, and sufficient (single-rule) decision-making, which avoids the combinatorial complexity of additive rule ensembles. Through extensive evaluation across 40 datasets, FRR demonstrates: (1) superior performance to traditional rule-based methods (e.g., $5\%$ average accuracy over RIPPER); (2) comparable accuracy to tree-based models (e.g., CART) using rule bases $90\%$ more compact; and (3) achieves $96\%$ of the accuracy of state-of-the-art additive rule-based models while using only sufficient rules and requiring only $3\%$ of their rule base size.

<title>Enhanced uncertainty quantification variational autoencoders for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems</title>

Abstract: Among other uses, neural networks are a powerful tool for solving deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems in real-time, where variational autoencoders, a specialized type of neural network, enable the Bayesian estimation of model parameters and their distribution from observational data allowing real-time inverse uncertainty quantification. In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.

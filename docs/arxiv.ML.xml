Summary:
Granger causality analysis in time series can be challenging due to non-linear dependencies. The proposed Granger causal xLSTM (GC-xLSTM) model utilizes the extended Long Short-Term Memory architecture to capture long-range relations between variables. By enforcing sparsity through a dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection, the model identifies and improves sparsity candidates. Through joint optimization, Granger causal relations are robustly recovered. Experimental evaluation on six datasets showcases the effectiveness of the GC-xLSTM model, demonstrating its potential in analyzing and predicting causal relationships between time series variables.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Causality in time series can be difficult to determine, especially in the presence of non-linear dependencies. The concept of Granger causality helps analyze potential relationships between variables, thereby offering a method to determine whether one time series can predict - Granger cause - future values of another. Although successful, Granger causal methods still struggle with capturing long-range relations between variables. To this end, we leverage the recently successful Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture and propose Granger causal xLSTMs (GC-xLSTM). It first enforces sparsity between the time series components by using a novel dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection. Specifically, we adaptively improve the model and identify sparsity candidates. Our joint optimization procedure then ensures that the Granger causal relations are recovered robustly. Our experimental evaluation on six diverse datasets demonstrates the overall efficacy of our proposed GC-xLSTM model.

Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

Summary:  This study compares semi-supervised learning (SSL) and pre-trained models in scenarios with limited labeled data. The Few-shot SSL framework is introduced to enable a fair comparison between the two approaches by controlling the amount of labeled data. Extensive experiments show that pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generally outperform SSL methods, especially in high-resolution data with clear semantic structure. The study suggests that future SSL research should consider comparing with pre-trained models and exploring ways to integrate pre-trained knowledge for enhanced performance, such as using it to improve pseudo-labeling. To support further research, the authors have released a unified reproduction and evaluation framework, with codes available for access. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework.

ZenFlow is a novel offloading framework designed to fine-tune large language models efficiently.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often exceeds GPU memory limits, prompting systems to offload model states to CPU memory. However, existing offloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally and update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast, expensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe transfers. We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes important parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow performs in-place updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously offloading and accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU work with GPU computation. To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a lightweight gradient selection method that exploits a novel spatial and temporal locality property of important gradients, avoiding costly global synchronization. ZenFlow achieves up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe traffic, and reduces GPU stalls by over 85 percent, all while preserving accuracy.

<div> neural network operators, memory effects, randomness, fractional derivatives, stochastic perturbations
Summary: 
This work introduces a new class of neural network operators designed to address problems involving memory effects and randomness. These operators combine symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional derivatives, and stochastic perturbations through It\^o type noise, providing a powerful framework for approximating functions with long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. The mathematical foundations of these operators are developed, with key theorems proving their asymptotic behavior, convergence in the mean-square sense, and consistency under fractional regularity assumptions. The estimates explicitly consider the memory parameter alpha and noise level sigma. In an application to the fractional Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, commonly used to model turbulence in fluid flows with memory, the proposed theory offers theoretical guarantees on approximation quality. This research suggests that these neural operators can be valuable in analyzing and simulating complex systems, particularly in turbulent phenomena and multiscale processes where memory and randomness play crucial roles. By integrating concepts from neural networks, fractional calculus, and stochastic analysis, this work paves the way for hybrid learning-based methods supported by strong analytical foundations.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. These operators merge symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional derivatives, and stochastic perturbations introduced via It\^o type noise. The result is a powerful framework capable of approximating functions that evolve over time with both long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. We develop the mathematical foundations of these operators, proving three key theorems of Voronovskaya type. These results describe the asymptotic behavior of the operators, their convergence in the mean-square sense, and their consistency under fractional regularity assumptions. All estimates explicitly account for the influence of the memory parameter $\alpha$ and the noise level $\sigma$. As a practical application, we apply the proposed theory to the fractional Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, a model often used to describe turbulence in fluid flows with memory. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees for the approximation quality and suggests that these neural operators can serve as effective tools in the analysis and simulation of complex systems. By blending ideas from neural networks, fractional calculus, and stochastic analysis, this research opens new perspectives for modeling turbulent phenomena and other multiscale processes where memory and randomness are fundamental. The results lay the groundwork for hybrid learning-based methods with strong analytical backing.

Abstract: The pursuit of alpha returns that exceed market benchmarks has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from intuition-driven investing to autonomous, AI powered systems. This paper introduces a comprehensive five stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies, statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic architectures powered by large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior surveys focused narrowly on modeling techniques, this review adopts a system level lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion, and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.

Summary: 
This study introduces the concept of test-time compute (TTC) as a means to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs). By allocating additional computational resources during inference, TTC shows potential to achieve better accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. The research demonstrates that TTC outperforms traditional model scaling, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning. An important finding is the impact of TTC performance on output sequence length, highlighting the value of adjusting compute resources based on query complexity. This approach could lead to more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models without the need for additional pretraining costs. <div>

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional pretraining costs.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework, the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN, for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting. This framework addresses the limitation of current STGNNs in capturing long-term spatial-temporal dependencies and similarities across MTS data for accurate forecasting. It incorporates a Long-term History Encoder to encode long-term history, a Hierarchical Representation Retriever to include spatial information, and a Transformer-based Aggregator to selectively fuse contextual representations. Experimental results show that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on real-world datasets. It also improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on rapidly changing patterns in the datasets. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-term spatial-temporal correlations and improving prediction accuracy in MTS forecasting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting. Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator (TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the datasets.

<div> Keywords: denoising diffusion probabilistic models, synthetic sensor signals, similarity metrics, training optimization, generative models 

Summary: 
Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have the ability to generate synthetic sensor signals by training them using a loss function that measures the difference between added noise and predicted noise. However, the randomness in the process and the loss function itself make it challenging to assess the data quality. To address this, the study explores various similarity metrics and adapts an existing metric to monitor the training and data synthesis processes. This adapted metric can be fine-tuned on input data to align with classification task requirements. By using this approach, the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of training epochs without compromising classification performance, leading to resource savings and faster training of generative models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.

Summary:
Diffusion models are powerful in generating various types of data but suffer from slow inference due to sequential denoising processes. Traditional parallelization methods have high communication overhead. The ParaStep method proposed in this study utilizes a reuse-then-predict mechanism to parallelize diffusion inference by capitalizing on similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike existing approaches, ParaStep minimizes communication overhead by employing lightweight, step-wise communication. The results demonstrate significant speedups of up to 3.88x on SVD, 2.43x on CogVideoX-2b, and 6.56x on AudioLDM2-large while maintaining generation quality. ParaStep proves to be a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, especially in environments with limited bandwidth.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained personal devices due to high computational and memory demands for task-specific fine-tuning. In this paper, the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH) is introduced, suggesting that certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions during fine-tuning iterations. Building on OSSH, the Quaff framework is proposed, which optimizes low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers in invariant channels using lightweight operations, reducing quantization errors and memory usage. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that Quaff improves efficiency, performance, and deployability. On the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves latency reduction, memory savings, and accuracy enhancement over full-precision fine-tuning, allowing for personalized LLM deployment on consumer-grade GPUs like the RTX 2080 Super without compromising model utility.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment.

Summary: <br />
Composites are widely used materials, necessitating accurate assessment of their mechanical properties through Finite Element (FE) modelling. Current FE models are computationally expensive, leading to the use of AI models, but existing approaches lack accuracy and transparency. This study introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Explainable AI (XAI) methods to predict composite mechanical properties with high accuracy. Custom CNNs trained on transverse tension test data outperform a baseline model, ResNet-34, in estimating Young's modulus and yield strength. XAI methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients are employed to explain predictions, showcasing the critical geometrical features influencing composite behavior. This transparency allows engineers to validate model trustworthiness and aligns with the science of composites, enhancing understanding and application in various industries. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composites are amongst the most important materials manufactured today, as evidenced by their use in countless applications. In order to establish the suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE) modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits; and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem. Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites' behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by representing the science of composites.

Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE. However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships, which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by CoCa-sampling.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework for training Deep Neural Networks that addresses the challenge of balancing performance and generalization. The key innovation is the Iterative Constructive Perturbation (ICP) technique, which optimizes both the model and its input data concurrently. By iteratively perturbing the input based on the model's loss, enhanced representations are gradually constructed. These enhanced features are then used in a self-distillation framework to improve performance and generalization. The approach alternately adjusts the model's parameters and the input data, bridging the gap between fitting and generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes common performance bottlenecks in neural networks and achieves significant improvements across various training variations. Through this cyclic optimization strategy, the framework offers a new perspective on training deep neural networks for enhanced performance and generalization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.

<div> framework, data synthesis, Large Language Models, simulation, statistical alignment
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel framework, LLMSynthor, for data synthesis that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture the statistical structure of real-world distributions. LLMSynthor transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators by utilizing them as nonparametric copula simulators to model high-order dependencies. It introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to enhance sampling efficiency and alignment with real data, without rejection sampling. The iterative synthesis loop minimizes discrepancies in summary statistics space, gradually uncovering and refining generative structures. Evaluations in controlled and real-world settings demonstrate the high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability of the synthetic data generated. LLMSynthor proves valuable in various domains such as economics, social science, and urban studies by producing synthetic data that accurately represents real-world distributions. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling. Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient, constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment. Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce, population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian optimization, Large Language Models, contextual knowledge, surrogate modeling, exploration-exploitation trade-off 

Summary:
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular tool for optimizing costly black-box functions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in low-data scenarios, making them attractive for black-box optimization. However, using LLMs alone poses risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty. To address this, LLINBO combines LLMs with statistical surrogate models like Gaussian Processes to improve optimization reliability. This hybrid approach leverages LLMs for early exploration and statistical models for efficient exploitation. The paper introduces three mechanisms for collaboration and establishes theoretical guarantees for their effectiveness. A real-world application in 3D printing showcases the proposed framework's efficacy. The code for reproducing the results is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on developing deep learning models to forecast the number of patients in the emergency department boarding phase six hours in advance. Data from various sources were used to train the models, which included ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, TSiTPlus, and N-BEATSx. The best-performing model was N-BEATSx, achieving high accuracy metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination. The model showed stability even during high boarding count periods. The results demonstrate that accurate forecasts can be made without using patient-level clinical data, and the inclusion of additional features further improved prediction stability during extreme conditions. This framework provides a practical and generalizable approach for hospital systems to anticipate boarding levels and address ED overcrowding.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical, operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08, root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95. The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions. This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.

Summary: 
The paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel optimizer for neural networks inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation simulations. The optimizer reimagines the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, promoting parameter diversity during optimization. This helps mitigate parameter condensation, preventing the collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces. The approach is rooted in physics and models stochastic particle collisions using a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation. Mathematical proof and a physical interpretation of the property are established. Extensive experiments on image and text classification tasks show that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers like Adam and SGD, achieving accuracy improvements with comparable computation cost. <div>

Abstract: The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.

arXiv:2505.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science applications.

Summary:<br />
Survival analysis is crucial in various real-world applications, but the uncertainty of predictions from survival models remains a challenge. SurvUnc is introduced as a model-agnostic framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification in survival models. It leverages concordance knowledge and pairwise ranking performance to effectively estimate uncertainty without requiring modifications to the underlying survival model. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and various survival models, SurvUnc demonstrates superior performance in multiple evaluation scenarios, including selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. The results highlight SurvUnc's ability to enhance model interpretability and reliability, making survival predictions more trustworthy in high-stakes domains like healthcare and risk assessment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment. Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival predictions in real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: imitation learning, satisficing theory, deep reinforcement learning, policy, demonstrations

Summary:
Focused on satisficing theory, this study challenges the assumption in imitation learning that demonstrations are near-optimal. Instead, it proposes a focused satisficing approach that aims to surpass the demonstrator's personal levels of aspiration without explicitly learning them. By using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, the approach focuses the policy on imitating the highest quality parts of demonstrations. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing imitation learning techniques by providing higher rates of guaranteed acceptability to the demonstrator while achieving competitive true returns in various environments. This approach allows for the identification of acceptable behaviors that may not be optimal but still meet the demonstrator's aspiration levels, leading to more robust imitation learning outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving (near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of environments.

Summary:
In this work, a model-based continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) algorithm is proposed to achieve both sample and computational efficiency. The approach uses optimism-based confidence sets to establish the first sample complexity guarantee for CTRL with general function approximation. The algorithm can learn a near-optimal policy with a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{R}} + d_{\mathcal{F}}}N^{-1/2})$ using $N$ measurements, where $d_{\mathcal{R}}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ are the distributional Eluder dimensions of the reward and dynamic functions, respectively. Structured policy updates and an alternative measurement strategy are introduced to reduce the number of policy updates and rollouts while maintaining sample efficiency. Experimental results on continuous control tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

Moreover, we introduce structured policy updates and an alternative measurement strategy that significantly reduce the number of policy updates and rollouts while maintaining competitive sample efficiency. We implemented experiments to backup our proposed algorithms on continuous control tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning, demonstrating comparable performance with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new causal inference framework called assimilative causal inference (ACI) that determines cause-and-effect relationships in a dynamic system. Unlike traditional methods, ACI identifies instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of causal influence ranges by solving an inverse problem using Bayesian data assimilation techniques. ACI captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where roles as causes and effects can shift over time. It utilizes a mathematically justified criteria to determine causal influence ranges without empirical thresholds and is scalable to high-dimensional problems. ACI is effective for short time series and incomplete datasets, making it applicable to complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events. Moreover, ACI does not require observations of potential causes, providing an advantage when drivers are unknown or unmeasured. <div>
arXiv:2505.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference (ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods, ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables. ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets. Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events.

Summary:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains, but its statistical efficiency can be improved. This study introduces a method to increase efficiency by selecting an informative subset of training examples. By choosing examples that maximize information gain, measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM, the approach efficiently approximates the selection process. Using multinomial logistic regression models to linearize the LLM at the last layer aids in computational efficiency and analysis. Empirical testing on various problems confirms the method's effectiveness, supported by quantitative results and LLM evaluations. The proposed approach enhances SFT by optimizing the selection of training examples and demonstrates improved performance across different domains.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples. Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain, measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new causal discovery algorithm called Kausal, which utilizes a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism. This algorithm is designed to identify cause-effect mechanisms in complex systems with nonlinear dynamics. Traditional statistical approaches struggle with quantifying causal relationships in such systems due to feedback mechanisms and nonstationarity. Kausal leverages deep learning to infer optimal observables, which are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to determine causal estimates. The algorithm outperforms existing methods in discovering and characterizing causal signals. The study also applies Kausal to analyze the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The code for Kausal is openly available on GitHub for researchers to utilize. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making, and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing, and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning. Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we extend our analysis to observations of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. Our code is available at https://github.com/juannat7/kausal.

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, Attention computation, Subquadratic time complexity, Large head dimension, Fine-grained complexity assumptions

Summary:
Efficient attention computation methods have been a topic of interest, especially concerning the Transformer architecture. Current algorithms for computing attention have quadratic time complexity in context length, but recent research has shown subquadratic time is possible with certain conditions. This study explores when attention can be computed efficiently without constraints on temperature and aims to identify fast algorithms that scale appropriately with entry size B. The research presents a subquadratic time algorithm for attention even with large B and low-rank matrices, as well as for attention gradient computation in training processes. The study suggests that significant improvements beyond the proposed algorithm are unlikely and demonstrates that under specific conditions, the standard algorithm remains optimal. Overall, the research contributes to understanding the efficiency and limitations of attention computation in complex models like Transformers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$). Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d = 2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under $\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity assumptions.

Summary:<br />
Machine learning models have been successful in classifying variable stars, but they often encounter challenges with biases in the training data. This paper proposes a novel self-regulated training approach for variable star classification using synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced variational autoencoder. By incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3, the method facilitates a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model to address biases and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experimental results demonstrate that the self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional methods in classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements. This novel approach offers a promising solution to enhance the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.

Summary: 
The study focuses on learning the mean of multiple groups with unknown data distributions in a fair manner. It employs an active learning framework to sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, updating estimates of group means and variances. The objective is to minimize collective noise in estimators by selecting groups based on upper confidence bounds on variance estimates. The proposed Variance-UCB algorithm improves upon existing bounds on regret, providing efficient learning from various distributions. The research offers new insights for adaptive experimentation in online platforms and clinical trials, with promising results for minimizing noise in mean estimators. <div>
arXiv:2505.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fundamental learning problem over multiple groups with unknown data distributions, where an analyst would like to learn the mean of each group. Moreover, we want to ensure that this data is collected in a relatively fair manner such that the noise of the estimate of each group is reasonable. In particular, we focus on settings where data are collected dynamically, which is important in adaptive experimentation for online platforms or adaptive clinical trials for healthcare. In our model, we employ an active learning framework to sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, observing a sample in each period from the chosen group. After observing a sample, the analyst updates their estimate of the mean and variance of that group and chooses the next group accordingly. The analyst's objective is to dynamically collect samples to minimize the collective noise of the estimators, measured by the norm of the vector of variances of the mean estimators.
  We propose an algorithm, Variance-UCB, that sequentially selects groups according to an upper confidence bound on the variance estimate. We provide a general theoretical framework for providing efficient bounds on learning from any underlying distribution where the variances can be estimated reasonably. This framework yields upper bounds on regret that improve significantly upon all existing bounds, as well as a collection of new results for different objectives and distributions than those previously studied.

<div> Keywords: large language model, inference acceleration, contextual sparsity, Polar Sparsity, GPU kernels

Summary: 
Polar Sparsity introduces a new sparsity technique that focuses on Attention layers as batch size and sequence length scale, shifting importance from MLP layers. While batch efficiency improves for MLP layers, their sparsity decreases, whereas Attention layers maintain stable sparsity and become more computationally expensive at scale. The development of hardware-efficient GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations results in significant speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 & 3, without compromising accuracy. This work demonstrates that Polar Sparsity can effectively scale to large batch sizes, providing substantial inference acceleration and making it practical for high-throughput LLM deployment systems. The code for this project is accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.

<div> Keywords: power transformers, dissolved gas analysis, machine learning, domain adaptation, feature-weighted

Summary:
This study focuses on improving fault diagnosis for power transformers using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) through a machine learning-based approach. Traditional heuristic methods lack consistency, so a feature-weighted domain adaptation technique is proposed to address distribution shifts in diagnostic data among different transformers. By combining Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and feature-specific weighting (MCW), this method effectively aligns source and target domains. Experimental results show a 7.9% improvement over Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC), demonstrating robustness across various training sample sizes. The proposed technique outperforms existing methods and enhances diagnostic accuracy for power transformer fault detection, critical for ensuring grid stability and reliable operation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the reliable operation of power transformers is critical to grid stability. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is widely used for fault diagnosis, but traditional methods rely on heuristic rules, which may lead to inconsistent results. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have improved diagnostic accuracy; however, power transformers operate under varying conditions, and differences in transformer type, environmental factors, and operational settings create distribution shifts in diagnostic data. Consequently, direct model transfer between transformers often fails, making techniques for domain adaptation a necessity. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a feature-weighted domain adaptation technique that combines Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Correlation Alignment (CORAL) with feature-specific weighting (MCW). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics are used to assign adaptable weights, prioritizing features with larger distributional discrepancies and thereby improving source and target domain alignment. Experimental evaluations on datasets for power transformers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves a 7.9% improvement over Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC). Furthermore, it outperforms both techniques across various training sample sizes, confirming its robustness for domain adaptation.

<div> framework, wavelet-based denoising, multi-channel Swin Transformer model, customized loss function, predictive maintenance

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel framework for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings in industrial systems. The framework combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model (MCSFormer) to address degradation trends and noise presence. The model utilizes attention mechanisms for feature fusion to learn global and local degradation patterns, enhancing predictive performance. A customized loss function is developed to prioritize accurate early detection and minimize operation risks of late predictions. Evaluation with the PRONOSTIA dataset showed that MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models in intra-condition experiments, achieved superior generalization in cross-condition testing, and effectively reduced late predictions with a custom loss function. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability, and focus on safety make MCSFormer a reliable predictive maintenance tool for industrial applications.

Abstract: Precise estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings is an important consideration to avoid unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and promote safety and efficiency in industrial systems. Complications in degradation trends, noise presence, and the necessity to detect faults in advance make estimation of RUL a challenging task. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model (MCSFormer) to address these problems. With attention mechanisms incorporated for feature fusion, the model is designed to learn global and local degradation patterns utilizing hierarchical representations for enhancing predictive performance. Additionally, a customized loss function is developed as a key distinction of this work to differentiate between early and late predictions, prioritizing accurate early detection and minimizing the high operation risks of late predictions. The proposed model was evaluated with the PRONOSTIA dataset using three experiments. Intra-condition experiments demonstrated that MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models, including the Adaptive Transformer, MDAN, and CNN-SRU, achieving 41%, 64%, and 69% lower MAE on average across different operating conditions, respectively. In terms of cross-condition testing, it achieved superior generalization under varying operating conditions compared to the adapted ViT and Swin Transformer. Lastly, the custom loss function effectively reduced late predictions, as evidenced in a 6.3% improvement in the scoring metric while maintaining competitive overall performance. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability, and focus on safety make MCSFormer a trustworthy and effective predictive maintenance tool in industrial applications.

<div> evolution of data, retraining, machine learning model, distribution shift detection, uncertainty-based method <br />
Summary: 
A new method is proposed to address the challenge of determining when to retrain machine learning models in response to evolving data. The problem is complicated by limited information, unknown distribution shifts, and the need to balance the cost of retraining with performance. Existing approaches are limited in different ways, prompting the development of a new uncertainty-based method. This method continually forecasts the model performance evolution using a bounded metric to make decisions on retraining. Experimental results on classification tasks across 7 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, consistently outperforming existing baselines. The method offers a comprehensive solution to the retraining problem by considering practical constraints, data scarcity, and cost trade-offs. <div>
arXiv:2505.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in maintaining real-world machine learning models is responding to the continuous and unpredictable evolution of data. Most practitioners are faced with the difficult question: when should I retrain or update my machine learning model? This seemingly straightforward problem is particularly challenging for three reasons: 1) decisions must be made based on very limited information - we usually have access to only a few examples, 2) the nature, extent, and impact of the distribution shift are unknown, and 3) it involves specifying a cost ratio between retraining and poor performance, which can be hard to characterize. Existing works address certain aspects of this problem, but none offer a comprehensive solution. Distribution shift detection falls short as it cannot account for the cost trade-off; the scarcity of the data, paired with its unusual structure, makes it a poor fit for existing offline reinforcement learning methods, and the online learning formulation overlooks key practical considerations. To address this, we present a principled formulation of the retraining problem and propose an uncertainty-based method that makes decisions by continually forecasting the evolution of model performance evaluated with a bounded metric. Our experiments addressing classification tasks show that the method consistently outperforms existing baselines on 7 datasets.

Through an in-depth analysis, the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on prediction performance is demonstrated.

Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and designing effective therapies. Yet exhaustively exploring the space of possible perturbations (e.g., multi-gene perturbations or across tissues and cell types) is prohibitively expensive, motivating methods that can generalize to unseen conditions. In this work, we explore how knowledge graphs of gene-gene relationships can improve out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction across three challenging settings: unseen single perturbations; unseen double perturbations; and unseen cell lines. In particular, we present: (i) TxPert, a new state-of-the-art method that leverages multiple biological knowledge networks to predict transcriptional responses under OOD scenarios; (ii) an in-depth analysis demonstrating the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on performance; and (iii) an expanded benchmarking framework that strengthens evaluation standards for perturbation modeling.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM), assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle novel inputs without labeled OOD data.
  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal reliability guarantees.
  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.
  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal human efforts.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to bias mitigation in machine learning models trained on graph data. The researchers propose a training-free unlearning procedure that uses a single-step Newton update on the model weights to certify bias mitigation. By selectively unlearning nodal features and structurally important elements in the graph, the proposed method aims to reduce algorithmic bias while maintaining high utility in tasks such as node classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the unlearning strategies in mitigating bias, with favorable trade-offs between utility and complexity compared to retraining from scratch with augmented data. The development of fairness-aware unlearning strategies and refined bounds for certified unlearning further contribute to the field of graph unlearning and bias mitigation in machine learning models. <div>
arXiv:2505.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing enforcement of the right to be forgotten regulations has propelled recent advances in certified (graph) unlearning strategies to comply with data removal requests from deployed machine learning (ML) models. Motivated by the well-documented bias amplification predicament inherent to graph data, here we take a fresh look at graph unlearning and leverage it as a bias mitigation tool. Given a pre-trained graph ML model, we develop a training-free unlearning procedure that offers certifiable bias mitigation via a single-step Newton update on the model weights. This way, we contribute a computationally lightweight alternative to the prevalent training- and optimization-based fairness enhancement approaches, with quantifiable performance guarantees. We first develop a novel fairness-aware nodal feature unlearning strategy along with refined certified unlearning bounds for this setting, whose impact extends beyond the realm of graph unlearning. We then design structural unlearning methods endowed with principled selection mechanisms over nodes and edges informed by rigorous bias analyses. Unlearning these judiciously selected elements can mitigate algorithmic biases with minimal impact on downstream utility (e.g., node classification accuracy). Experimental results over real networks corroborate the bias mitigation efficacy of our unlearning strategies, and delineate markedly favorable utility-complexity trade-offs relative to retraining from scratch using augmented graph data obtained via removals.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel framework for privacy-preserving conversion rate prediction in online advertising. It addresses the challenge of predicting conversion rates while respecting user privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. The proposed method enables collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients, using batch-level aggregated gradients to minimize privacy risks. It incorporates adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce communication costs. Additionally, de-biasing techniques are employed to train the model under label differential privacy, maintaining accuracy despite privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Experimental results on industrial datasets show competitive performance in terms of ROCAUC, reduced communication overhead, and compliance with privacy requirements. This framework sets a new standard for high-performance CVR prediction while ensuring privacy in the digital advertising landscape. <div>

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate (CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction. This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components: (1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.

Abstract: AI systems in high-consequence domains such as defense, intelligence, and disaster response must detect rare, high-impact events while operating under tight resource constraints. Traditional annotation strategies that prioritize label volume over informational value introduce redundancy and noise, limiting model generalization. This paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data strategy that emphasizes label diversity, model-guided selection, and marginal utility-based stopping. We implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization (ALO), combining pre-labeling triage, annotator disagreement analysis, and iterative feedback to prioritize labels that meaningfully improve model performance. Experiments show that models trained on 20 to 40 percent of curated data can match or exceed full-data baselines, particularly in rare-class recall and edge-case generalization. We also demonstrate how latent labeling errors embedded in training and validation sets can distort evaluation, underscoring the need for embedded audit tools and performance-aware governance. Smart-sizing reframes annotation as a feedback-driven process aligned with mission outcomes, enabling more robust models with fewer labels and supporting efficient AI development pipelines for frontier models and operational systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind, this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task, based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution) inputs.
  In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad range of anomaly types with high accuracy.

<br />
Summary: Speculative decoding is a technique that utilizes hardware concurrency to enhance the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive Transformer models. State-space models (SSMs) already offer better efficiency than AR Transformers as their state summarizes past data without token caching. However, existing approaches to speculative decoding in SSMs do not leverage tree-based verification methods. This paper introduces a scalable algorithm for tree-based speculative decoding in SSMs and hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures. By exploiting the structure of state transition matrices, the algorithm minimizes overhead and improves inference speed. The proposed hardware-aware implementation outperforms vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs on multiple benchmarks, paving the way for further speed enhancements with SSM and hybrid models. Code availability will follow paper acceptance. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass. State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers, since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently. We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<br />Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to training flat goal-conditioned policies by utilizing subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. By eliminating the need for a generative model over the goal space, the proposed method overcomes the challenges of scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. The algorithm outperforms existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches in a variety of locomotion and manipulation benchmarks. The method achieves strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks where previous approaches struggle, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in complex environments. <div>
arXiv:2505.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

Summary:
The Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM) is introduced as a lightweight verifier for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve mathematical reasoning. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to assign energy scores to Chain of Thought solutions, ranking candidates based on coherence and correctness. Without detailed annotations, EORM improves final answer accuracy on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8k and MATH. It enhances LLM reasoning reliability by efficiently verifying solutions, matching or exceeding brute force sampling performance. EORM's streamlined post hoc verification process ensures robust multi step logical consistency in mathematical reasoning tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach to selective classification, aiming to enhance the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. Through the application of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, the optimal rejection rule is characterized as a likelihood ratio test. This perspective unifies various post-hoc selection baselines and inspires new methods for selective classification. A key focus is on covariate shift, where the input distribution differs between training and testing. The proposed Neyman--Pearson-based methods outperform existing baselines across a range of vision and language tasks, including supervised learning and vision-language models. Through experiments, it is shown that likelihood ratio-based selection provides a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts. The code for these methods is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines, indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts.

Summary:
This study investigates the approximation capabilities and convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers in noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning for next-token prediction. The research fills gaps in existing knowledge by proving the Bayes optimality of a class of one-layer transformers using linear and ReLU attention. Through finite-sample analysis, the study demonstrates that the expected loss of these transformers converges at a linear rate to the Bayes risk when trained with gradient descent. Additionally, the trained models exhibit generalization abilities to unseen samples and display observed learning behaviors. The theoretical findings are supported by extensive empirical validations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the performance of one-layer transformers in in-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

Summary:<br />
MSH-GNN is a novel Graph Neural Network architecture that incorporates feature-wise adaptive message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. It dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive directions determined by the node's own representation and modulates them using sinusoidal encodings at multiple frequencies to capture structural patterns.

Abstract: Conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighbor embeddings as holistic vectors, lacking the ability to identify fine-grained, direction-specific feature relevance. We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node, MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive directions determined by the target node's own representation. These projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks. Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate graph discrimination.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices, driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques. To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to 14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Tango, a novel framework that uses reinforcement learning to concurrently train a large language model (LLM) generator and a process-level verifier in an interleaved manner. Unlike traditional approaches, Tango's verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards, leading to improved robustness and generalization. The generator within Tango achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple math benchmarks and reasoning tasks, while the verifier excels on the ProcessBench dataset. Both components exhibit substantial improvements on challenging mathematical reasoning problems, showcasing the effectiveness of the Tango framework in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The code for Tango is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

arXiv:2505.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research.

Summary:
The paper introduces a unified framework for deep learning in any pseudo-metric space, decoupling the architecture from implementation. It presents a generalization bound that isolates the depth contribution in the growth of hidden layers, revealing a geometric dichotomy between sublinear and depth-independent rates. By linking polynomial growth to virtually nilpotent dynamics and exponential growth to expanding dynamics, the paper offers insights into the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Additionally, it provides covering-number estimates that show an exponential parameter saving for models with expanding dynamics, enhancing compositional expressivity. The results have implications for test-time inference and diffusion models, offering architecture-agnostic guarantees with a focus on dynamical systems awareness.

arXiv:2505.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps \(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$ isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial (resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding) dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$ (sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms such as test-time inference and diffusion models.

This article introduces MoTime, a set of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that combine temporal signals with external modalities like text, metadata, and images. The datasets cover various domains and enable the evaluation of modality usefulness in two scenarios. Firstly, in the common forecasting task where variable-length history is accessible, and secondly, in cold-start forecasting where no historical data is present. Experiments demonstrate that external modalities can enhance forecasting performance in both scenarios, especially benefiting short series in some datasets, though the impact varies based on data characteristics.

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.

<div> Keywords: feature engineering, agentic feature augmentation, Multi-Agent System, feature selection, feature generation

Summary:
Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of AI model performance improvement, where raw data is transformed into discriminative features. Existing methods often separate feature selection and generation, leading to a lack of balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions. To address this, a new approach called agentic feature augmentation is proposed, which unifies feature generation and selection through a Multi-Agent System with Long and Short-Term Memory (MAGS). This system includes a selector agent, a generator agent, and a router agent working together to optimize the feature space with immediate and long-term memory feedback. The router agent is trained using offline Proximal Policy Optimization to make effective decisions. Experimental results show that this unified agentic framework consistently outperforms traditional methods by intelligently coordinating feature selection and generation.

Abstract: As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions. To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating feature selection and generation.

<div> attention mechanism, transformer architecture, gradient estimator, backpropagation, computational graph

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a method to optimize the backpropagation process in transformer models by cutting backpropagation through attention weights. By probabilistically selecting a parameter *c* to limit the number of interactions each token has per attention head, the compute requirements for attention backpropagation can be reduced from quadratic to linear complexity. Empirical results show that cutting 99% of attention gradient flow with an appropriate choice of *c* results in minimal increase in gradient variance, making the approach promising for training transformer models on long sequences efficiently. This method allows for a more efficient sparse matrix implementation, reducing the backward pass cost significantly compared to the forward pass cost. <div>

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing $c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about $1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in healthcare, where accurate predictions of future health trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends and properties of predicted time series using static features. In this work, we extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our approach remains predictive while preserving interpretability and robustness. This work represents a step towards developing robust, and generalized time series forecasting models. The code is available at https://github.com/jeremy-qin/TIMEVIEW

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

<title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Entropy Minimization in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any labeled data or even any parameter updates.

Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-horizon average reward Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general parametrization. We propose a Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves global convergence and constraint violation rates of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.

<title>EC-LDA : Label Distribution Inference Attack against Federated Graph Learning with Embedding Compression</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.

arXiv:2505.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a popular method to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining their superior text generation performance. Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms, UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity, the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.

Abstract: Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which, however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD, DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning histories.

Abstract: In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains, making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention, enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use; and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes, often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization (reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness, with significantly lower training and inference times.

Abstract: Lipschitz neural networks are well-known for providing certified robustness in deep learning. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient Block Reflector Orthogonal (BRO) layer that enhances the capability of orthogonal layers on constructing more expressive Lipschitz neural architectures. In addition, by theoretically analyzing the nature of Lipschitz neural networks, we introduce a new loss function that employs an annealing mechanism to increase margin for most data points. This enables Lipschitz models to provide better certified robustness. By employing our BRO layer and loss function, we design BRONet - a simple yet effective Lipschitz neural network that achieves state-of-the-art certified robustness. Extensive experiments and empirical analysis on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet validate that our method outperforms existing baselines.

arXiv:2505.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps (the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right) \mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional training or model modification.

<title>A Unified Gradient-based Framework for Task-agnostic Continual Learning-Unlearning</title>

arXiv:2505.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep models have highlighted the need for intelligent systems that combine continual learning (CL) for knowledge acquisition with machine unlearning (MU) for data removal, forming the Continual Learning-Unlearning (CLU) paradigm. While existing work treats CL and MU as separate processes, we reveal their intrinsic connection through a unified optimization framework based on Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. This framework decomposes gradient updates for approximate CLU into four components: learning new knowledge, unlearning targeted data, preserving existing knowledge, and modulation via weight saliency. A critical challenge lies in balancing knowledge update and retention during sequential learning-unlearning cycles. To resolve this stability-plasticity dilemma, we introduce a remain-preserved manifold constraint to induce a remaining Hessian compensation for CLU iterations. A fast-slow weight adaptation mechanism is designed to efficiently approximate the second-order optimization direction, combined with adaptive weighting coefficients and a balanced weight saliency mask, proposing a unified implementation framework for gradient-based CLU. Furthermore, we pioneer task-agnostic CLU scenarios that support fine-grained unlearning at the cross-task category and random sample levels beyond the traditional task-aware setups. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UG-CLU framework effectively coordinates incremental learning, precise unlearning, and knowledge stability across multiple datasets and model architectures, providing a theoretical foundation and methodological support for dynamic, compliant intelligent systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM (Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced feature representations throughout the network.

Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original, potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise regime.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.

Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically. To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice (PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm, constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader. Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t \frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$. This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log (m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary and real-world multi-class datasets.

Abstract: Efficient task scheduling is paramount in the Linux kernel, where the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) meticulously manages CPU resources to balance high utilization with interactive responsiveness. This research pioneers the use of deep learning techniques to predict the sequence of tasks selected by CFS, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of a more generalized and potentially more adaptive task scheduler for diverse workloads. Our core contributions are twofold: first, the systematic generation and curation of a novel scheduling dataset from a running Linux kernel, capturing real-world CFS behavior; and second, the development, training, and evaluation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network designed to accurately forecast the next task to be scheduled. This paper further discusses the practical pathways and implications of integrating such a predictive model into the kernel's scheduling framework. The findings and methodologies presented herein open avenues for data-driven advancements in kernel scheduling, with the full source code provided for reproducibility and further exploration.

arXiv:2505.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.

arXiv:2505.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making, can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

<title>Neural Collapse is Globally Optimal in Deep Regularized ResNets and Transformers</title>

Abstract: The empirical emergence of neural collapse -- a surprising symmetry in the feature representations of the training data in the penultimate layer of deep neural networks -- has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at its understanding. However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that, as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.

<title>Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture</title>

arXiv:2505.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

<title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations with Causal Logit Perturbation</title>

arXiv:2505.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has seen widespread success in various domains such as science, industry, and society. However, it is acknowledged that certain approaches suffer from non-robustness, relying on spurious correlations for predictions. Addressing these limitations is of paramount importance, necessitating the development of methods that can disentangle spurious correlations. {This study attempts to implement causal models via logit perturbations and introduces a novel Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP) framework to train classifiers with generated causal logit perturbations for individual samples, thereby mitigating the spurious associations between non-causal attributes (i.e., image backgrounds) and classes.} {Our framework employs a} perturbation network to generate sample-wise logit perturbations using a series of training characteristics of samples as inputs. The whole framework is optimized by an online meta-learning-based learning algorithm and leverages human causal knowledge by augmenting metadata in both counterfactual and factual manners. Empirical evaluations on four typical biased learning scenarios, including long-tail learning, noisy label learning, generalized long-tail learning, and subpopulation shift learning, demonstrate that CLP consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, visualization results support the effectiveness of the generated causal perturbations in redirecting model attention towards causal image attributes and dismantling spurious associations.

<title>Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection: Bridging Uncertainty Characterization and Pattern Classification</title>

arXiv:2505.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS) is an effective means of addressing the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. By removing redundant and irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures. Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately 99\%.

arXiv:2505.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations. In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations, yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and efficiency.

arXiv:2505.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Explorer-19BE for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection, which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI) measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes and transfers well to the training of large models.

Abstract: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility, our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4RLensemble-F7EE.

arXiv:2505.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains. Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of $47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of $1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$ on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.

This challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Neural network architectures have a large impact in machine learning. In reinforcement learning, network architectures have remained notably simple, as changes often lead to small gains in performance. This work introduces a novel encoder architecture for pixel-based model-free reinforcement learning. The Hadamax (\textbf{Hada}mard \textbf{max}-pooling) encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance by max-pooling Hadamard products between GELU-activated parallel hidden layers. Based on the recent PQN algorithm, the Hadamax encoder achieves state-of-the-art model-free performance in the Atari-57 benchmark. Specifically, without applying any algorithmic hyperparameter modifications, Hadamax-PQN achieves an 80\% performance gain over vanilla PQN and significantly surpasses Rainbow-DQN. For reproducibility, the full code is available on \href{https://github.com/Jacobkooi/Hadamax}{GitHub}.

<title>Human in the Loop Adaptive Optimization for Improved Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting models often produce systematic, predictable errors even in critical domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare. We introduce a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model. Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.

<title>Distributionally Robust Federated Learning with Client Drift Minimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

Abstract: Integer quantization has emerged as a critical technique to facilitate deployment on resource-constrained devices. Although they do reduce the complexity of the learning models, their inference performance is often prone to quantization-induced errors. To this end, we introduce InTreeger: an end-to-end framework that takes a training dataset as input, and outputs an architecture-agnostic integer-only C implementation of tree-based machine learning model, without loss of precision. This framework enables anyone, even those without prior experience in machine learning, to generate a highly optimized integer-only classification model that can run on any hardware simply by providing an input dataset and target variable. We evaluated our generated implementations across three different architectures (ARM, x86, and RISC-V), resulting in significant improvements in inference latency. In addition, we show the energy efficiency compared to typical decision tree implementations that rely on floating-point arithmetic. The results underscore the advantages of integer-only inference, making it particularly suitable for energy- and area-constrained devices such as embedded systems and edge computing platforms, while also enabling the execution of decision trees on existing ultra-low power devices.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.

<title>Efficient Differentiable Approximation of Generalized Low-rank Regularization</title>

Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps. In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks, which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/naiqili/EDLRR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable environments poses significant challenges due to the complexity of learning under uncertainty. While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can enhance training, effectively leveraging it remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Guided Policy Optimization (GPO), a framework that co-trains a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme achieves optimality comparable to direct RL, thereby overcoming key limitations inherent in existing approaches. Empirical evaluations show strong performance of GPO across various tasks, including continuous control with partial observability and noise, and memory-based challenges, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Capturing nonlinear relationships without sacrificing interpretability remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise, a novel framework that enhances stepwise regression. It adaptively transforms numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision trees, but only when such transformations improve model fit, as assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly capturing nonlinear effects. Implemented as a user-friendly R package, SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.

arXiv:2505.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

<title>Fast Rate Bounds for Multi-Task and Meta-Learning with Different Sample Sizes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new fast-rate generalization bounds for multi-task and meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training sets of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios. Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable, and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves, we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk, depending on whether if all tasks should be considered equally important or if sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators, both yielding compelling results.

<title>Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures for Compositional Embeddings in Machine Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to future work, which we plan to undertake.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has driven an explosion in the size of datasets consumed and produced by AI models. Traditional methods for unstructured data visualization, such as t-SNE and UMAP, have not kept up with the pace of dataset scaling. This presents a significant challenge for AI explainability, which relies on methods such as t-SNE and UMAP for exploratory data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Negative Or Mean Affinity Discrimination (NOMAD) Projection, the first method for unstructured data visualization via nonlinear dimensionality reduction that can run on multiple GPUs at train time. We provide theory that situates NOMAD Projection as an approximate upper bound on the InfoNC-t-SNE loss, and empirical results that demonstrate NOMAD Projection's superior performance and speed profile compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the scalability of NOMAD Projection by computing the first complete data map of Multilingual Wikipedia.

<title>AM-PPO: (Advantage) Alpha-Modulation with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO (AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

arXiv:2505.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs, Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation, the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.

<title>Short-Range Dependency Effects on Transformer Instability and a Decomposed Attention Solution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer language models have driven significant progress across various fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. A central component of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns rich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with others in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers continue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or divergence in the training loss during a run.
  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited ability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language modeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This limitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing training. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local (short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed attention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit explosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative training stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation perplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar perplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up to 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.

<title>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</title>

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts. Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor, consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting neural network behavior.

Abstract: The data-to-equation (Data2Eqn) task aims to discover interpretable mathematical equations that map observed values to labels, offering physical insights and broad applicability across academic and industrial domains. Genetic programming and traditional deep learning-based approaches suffer from search inefficiency and poor generalization on small task-specific datasets. Foundation models showed promise in this area, but existing approaches suffer from: 1) They are pretrained on general-purpose data distributions, making them less effective for domain-specific tasks; and 2) their training objectives focus on token-level alignment, overlooking mathematical semantics, which can lead to inaccurate equations. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the domain adaptability of foundation models for Data2Eqn tasks. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based finetuning framework that directly optimizes the generation policy of a pretrained model through reward signals derived from downstream numerical fitness. Our method allows the model to adapt to specific and complex data distributions and generate mathematically meaningful equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves both the accuracy and robustness of equation generation under complex distributions.

<title>Federated Learning with Unlabeled Clients: Personalization Can Happen in Low Dimensions</title>

Abstract: Personalized federated learning has emerged as a popular approach to training on devices holding statistically heterogeneous data, known as clients. However, most existing approaches require a client to have labeled data for training or finetuning in order to obtain their own personalized model. In this paper we address this by proposing FLowDUP, a novel method that is able to generate a personalized model using only a forward pass with unlabeled data. The generated model parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient communication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically motivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, that provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients. The objective is structured in such a way that it allows both clients with labeled data and clients with only unlabeled data to contribute to the training process. To supplement our theoretical results we carry out a thorough experimental evaluation of FLowDUP, demonstrating strong empirical performance on a range of datasets with differing sorts of statistically heterogeneous clients. Through numerous ablation studies, we test the efficacy of the individual components of the method.

<title>World Models as Reference Trajectories for Rapid Motor Adaptation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.

<title>Beyond Classification: Evaluating Diffusion Denoised Smoothing for Security-Utility Trade off</title>

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to be addressed.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.

<title>Benchmarking Energy and Latency in TinyML: A Novel Method for Resource-Constrained AI</title>

Abstract: The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested 1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

<title>Mechanistic Insights into Grokking from the Embedding Layer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately. Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics, where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and (2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization. To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio, \(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot \frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions hinder efficient training.

arXiv:2505.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks, demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates our explanations increase communicative utility.

<title>Guidelines for the Quality Assessment of Energy-Aware NAS Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2505.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is increasingly large energy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online, continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection, bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA and provide principled guidance on when practitioners should prefer one approach over the other.

<title>Optimal Best-Arm Identification under Fixed Confidence with Multiple Optima</title>

arXiv:2505.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal, its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP) in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and (ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with arbitrarily heterogeneous data, providing the first formal guarantees for finding DP-SOSP in such settings. Our analysis also highlights the detrimental impacts of private selection procedures in distributed learning under high-dimensional models, underscoring the practical benefits of our design. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our approach.

<title>Learning Small Decision Trees with Few Outliers: A Parameterized Perspective</title>

Abstract: Decision trees are a fundamental tool in machine learning for representing, classifying, and generalizing data. It is desirable to construct ``small'' decision trees, by minimizing either the \textit{size} ($s$) or the \textit{depth} $(d)$ of the \textit{decision tree} (\textsc{DT}). Recently, the parameterized complexity of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} has attracted a lot of attention. We consider a generalization of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} where given a \textit{classification instance} $E$ and an integer $t$, the task is to find a ``small'' \textsc{DT} that disagrees with $E$ in at most $t$ examples. We consider two problems: \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}, where the goal is to construct a \textsc{DT} minimizing $s$ and $d$, respectively. We first establish that both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO} are W[1]-hard when parameterized by $s+\delta_{max}$ and $d+\delta_{max}$, respectively, where $\delta_{max}$ is the maximum number of features in which two differently labeled examples can differ. We complement this result by showing that these problems become \textsc{FPT} if we include the parameter $t$. We also consider the kernelization complexity of these problems and establish several positive and negative results for both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}.

<title>LCDB 1.1: A Database Illustrating Learning Curves Are More Ill-Behaved Than Previously Thought</title>

Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a challenging benchmark for future research.

arXiv:2505.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

arXiv:2505.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

arXiv:2505.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$) $k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to high-arity.

arXiv:2505.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries, regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network, which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions. Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%). The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review (Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching, offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

<title>Improving planning and MBRL with temporally-extended actions</title>

Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.

<title>Projection-Based Correction for Enhancing Deep Inverse Networks</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in solving illposed inverse problems; however, many fail to strictly adhere to the physical constraints imposed by the measurement process. In this work, we introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically, given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.

arXiv:2505.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we contribute the first approach to solve infinite-horizon discounted general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) in the single-trial regime, i.e., when the agent's performance is evaluated based on a single trajectory. First, we provide some fundamental results regarding policy optimization in the single-trial regime, investigating which class of policies suffices for optimality, casting our problem as a particular MDP that is equivalent to our original problem, as well as studying the computational hardness of policy optimization in the single-trial regime. Second, we show how we can leverage online planning techniques, in particular a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, to solve GUMDPs in the single-trial regime. Third, we provide experimental results showcasing the superior performance of our approach in comparison to relevant baselines.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable insights for future model development.

<title>Fair Supervised Learning Through Constraints on Smooth Nonconvex Unfairness-Measure Surrogates</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15788</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time. Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.

<title>Model Merging is Secretly Certifiable: Non-Vacuous Generalisation Bounds for Low-Shot Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying the IID generalisation ability of deep networks is the first of many requirements for trusting AI in high-stakes applications from medicine to security. However, when instantiating generalisation bounds for deep networks it remains challenging to obtain non-vacuous guarantees, especially when applying contemporary large models on the small scale data prevalent in such high-stakes fields. In this paper, we draw a novel connection between a family of learning methods based on model fusion and generalisation certificates, and surprisingly show that with minor adjustment several existing learning strategies already provide non-trivial generalisation guarantees. Essentially, by focusing on data-driven learning of downstream tasks by fusion rather than fine-tuning, the certified generalisation gap becomes tiny and independent of the base network size, facilitating its certification. Our results show for the first time non-trivial generalisation guarantees for learning with as low as 100 examples, while using vision models such as VIT-B and language models such as mistral-7B. This observation is significant as it has immediate implications for facilitating the certification of existing systems as trustworthy, and opens up new directions for research at the intersection of practice and theory.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms for such task.

Abstract: We present a neural framework for learning conditional optimal transport (OT) maps between probability distributions. Our approach introduces a conditioning mechanism capable of processing both categorical and continuous conditioning variables simultaneously. At the core of our method lies a hypernetwork that generates transport layer parameters based on these inputs, creating adaptive mappings that outperform simpler conditioning methods. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our method over baseline configurations. Furthermore, we showcase an application to global sensitivity analysis, offering high performance in computing OT-based sensitivity indices. This work advances the state-of-the-art in conditional optimal transport, enabling broader application of optimal transport principles to complex, high-dimensional domains such as generative modeling and black-box model explainability.

arXiv:2505.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of creating strong, yet narrow, AI systems. While recent AI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation models, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be valuable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two challenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic properties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations. The first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from scratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes necessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain narrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend on each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a curriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge regards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small specialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized to a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based on pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a regularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while unlearning unnecessary skills.

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form (KBF) model. To address the limitations of linear parametric dependence in the KBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter system.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling, where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations. Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity, pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data limitations characteristic of industrial applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce \textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails. However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails, controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.

Abstract: Bone fractures are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Traditional X ray interpretation is time consuming and error prone, while existing machine learning and deep learning solutions often demand extensive feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and high computational resources. To address these challenges, a distributed hybrid quantum classical pipeline is proposed that first applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then leverages a 4 qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. By fusing eight PCA derived features with eight quantum enhanced features into a 16 dimensional vector and then classifying with different machine learning models achieving 99% accuracy using a public multi region X ray dataset on par with state of the art transfer learning models while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive, hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications. To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized 10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input. Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and clinical risk assessment.

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability. However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS, a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

Abstract: Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.

<title>Effective climate policies for major emission reductions of ozone precursors: Global evidence from two decades</title>

Abstract: Despite policymakers deploying various tools to mitigate emissions of ozone (O\textsubscript{3}) precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the effectiveness of policy combinations remains uncertain. We employ an integrated framework that couples structural break detection with machine learning to pinpoint effective interventions across the building, electricity, industrial, and transport sectors, identifying treatment effects as abrupt changes without prior assumptions about policy treatment assignment and timing. Applied to two decades of global O\textsubscript{3} precursor emissions data, we detect 78, 77, and 78 structural breaks for NO\textsubscript{x}, CO, and VOCs, corresponding to cumulative emission reductions of 0.96-0.97 Gt, 2.84-2.88 Gt, and 0.47-0.48 Gt, respectively. Sector-level analysis shows that electricity sector structural policies cut NO\textsubscript{x} by up to 32.4\%, while in buildings, developed countries combined adoption subsidies with carbon taxes to achieve 42.7\% CO reductions and developing countries used financing plus fuel taxes to secure 52.3\%. VOCs abatement peaked at 38.5\% when fossil-fuel subsidy reforms were paired with financial incentives. Finally, hybrid strategies merging non-price measures (subsidies, bans, mandates) with pricing instruments delivered up to an additional 10\% co-benefit. These findings guide the sequencing and complementarity of context-specific policy portfolios for O\textsubscript{3} precursor mitigation.

Abstract: Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves. Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and broader applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method, utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.Our evaluation shows LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively.

Abstract: The 5W1H questions -- who, what, when, where, why and how -- are commonly used in journalism to ensure that an article describes events clearly and systematically. Answering them is a crucial prerequisites for tasks such as summarization, clustering, and news aggregation. In this paper, we design the first automated extraction pipeline to get 5W1H information from French news articles. To evaluate the performance of our algo- rithm, we also create a corpus of 250 Quebec news articles with 5W1H answers marked by four human annotators. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline performs as well in this task as the large language model GPT-4o.

<title>Place Cells as Position Embeddings of Multi-Time Random Walk Transition Kernels for Path Planning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x, t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution $\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x, y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} = P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning. This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping -- while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Generalization of In-Context Learning: A Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective</title>

Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle, illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to capture distribution shifts.

arXiv:2505.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in conjunction with unsupervised learning techniques to learn powerful node representations, but their deployment is hindered by their high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and the absence of established methodologies for selecting the optimal models. To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a) adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in various settings. \footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}{github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}.}

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training) remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks (Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles, we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses, and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on 90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels, models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning, and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for classification tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units (ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here, initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, < 1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents JARVIS, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain expertise to generate high-quality scripts for specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks. By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains. We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future innovations in this field.

Abstract: Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to unseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold across different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current limitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how architectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design. SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.

<title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics. Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax, showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives. Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types, partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.

Abstract: First-order adaptive optimization methods like Adam are the default choices for training modern deep neural networks. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of these methods in non-smooth settings, particularly in Deep ReLU networks, remains limited. ReLU activations create exponentially many region boundaries where standard smoothness assumptions break down. \textbf{We derive the first \(\tilde{O}\!\bigl(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{eff}}/n}\bigr)\) generalization bound for Adam in Deep ReLU networks and the first global-optimal convergence for Adam in the non smooth, non convex relu landscape without a global PL or convexity assumption.} Our analysis is based on stratified Morse theory and novel results in Kakeya sets. We develop a multi-layer refinement framework that progressively tightens bounds on region crossings. We prove that the number of region crossings collapses from exponential to near-linear in the effective dimension. Using a Kakeya based method, we give a tighter generalization bound than PAC-Bayes approaches and showcase convergence using a mild uniform low barrier assumption.

Abstract: Daily environments have profound influence on our health and behavior. Recent work has shown that digital envirotyping, where computer vision is applied to images of daily environments taken during ecological momentary assessment (EMA), can be used to identify meaningful relationships between environmental features and health outcomes of interest. To systematically study such effects on an individual level, it is helpful to group images into distinct environments encountered in an individual's daily life; these may then be analyzed, further grouped into related environments with similar features, and linked to health outcomes. Here we introduce infinite hierarchical contrastive clustering to address this challenge. Building on the established contrastive clustering framework, our method a) allows an arbitrary number of clusters without requiring the full Dirichlet Process machinery by placing a stick-breaking prior on predicted cluster probabilities; and b) encourages distinct environments to form well-defined sub-clusters within each cluster of related environments by incorporating a participant-specific prediction loss. Our experiments show that our model effectively identifies distinct personal environments and groups these environments into meaningful environment types. We then illustrate how the resulting clusters can be linked to various health outcomes, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the envirotyping paradigm.

Abstract: This work demonstrates an airflow inertial based odometry system with multi-sensor data fusion, including thermal anemometer, IMU, ESC, and barometer. This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data, including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for 203s manual random flight. The open source is available on https://github.com/SyRoCo-ISIR/Flight-Speed-Estimation-Airflow.

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges, their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images, highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages. Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned. These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning. In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach. However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses, following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/DeepKD.

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Abstract: Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require further training.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.

Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.

Abstract: Data fusion, the process of combining observational and experimental data, can enable the identification of causal effects that would otherwise remain non-identifiable. Although identification algorithms have been developed for specific scenarios, do-calculus remains the only general-purpose tool for causal data fusion, particularly when variables are present in some data sources but not others. However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects. Examples from epidemiology and social science demonstrate the use of the results.

<title>BountyBench: Dollar Impact of AI Agent Attackers and Defenders on Real-World Cybersecurity Systems</title>

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.

Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is proposed for sustaining the dynamics of heterogeneous complex networks. We show that a single, small-scale reservoir computer trained on time series from a subset of elements is able to replicate the dynamics of any element in a large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic oscillators.

Abstract: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering, significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce. While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Abstract: The wide deployment of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has raised privacy concerns for both clients and servers. While cryptographic primitives can be employed for secure GPT inference to protect the privacy of both parties, they introduce considerable performance overhead.To accelerate secure inference, this study proposes a public decoding and secure verification approach that utilizes public GPT models, motivated by the observation that securely decoding one and multiple tokens takes a similar latency. The client uses the public model to generate a set of tokens, which are then securely verified by the private model for acceptance. The efficiency of our approach depends on the acceptance ratio of tokens proposed by the public model, which we improve from two aspects: (1) a private sampling protocol optimized for cryptographic primitives and (2) model alignment using knowledge distillation. Our approach improves the efficiency of secure decoding while maintaining the same level of privacy and generation quality as standard secure decoding. Experiments demonstrate a $2.1\times \sim 6.0\times$ speedup compared to standard decoding across three pairs of public-private models and different network conditions.

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.

<title>Learning-based Autonomous Oversteer Control and Collision Avoidance</title>

Abstract: Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer control with obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Despite the wide-scale usage and development of emotion classification datasets in NLP, the field lacks a standardized, large-scale resource that follows a psychologically grounded taxonomy. Existing datasets either use inconsistent emotion categories, suffer from limited sample size, or focus on specific domains. The Super Emotion Dataset addresses this gap by harmonizing diverse text sources into a unified framework based on Shaver's empirically validated emotion taxonomy, enabling more consistent cross-domain emotion recognition research.

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.

Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal systems routinely face missing-input scenarios, and in reality, robots lose audio in a factory or a clinical record omits lab tests at inference time. Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.

Abstract: This paper explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in SVM predictions, particularly for regression and forecasting tasks. Unlike the Neural Network, the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable. However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.

Abstract: Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction sets for any pre-trained model, guaranteeing that the true label lies within the set with a specified probability. However, these sets do not provide probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set. Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level. Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing expected calibration error.

Abstract: Recent efforts at scaling computer vision models have established Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the leading architecture. ViTs incorporate weight sharing over image patches as an important inductive bias. In this work, we show that ViTs benefit from incorporating equivariance under the octic group, i.e., reflections and 90-degree rotations, as a further inductive bias. We develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and segmentation results.

Abstract: The paper presents a decision support system for the long-term preservation of aeronautical heritage exhibited/stored in sheltered sites. The aeronautical heritage is characterized by diverse materials of which this heritage is constituted. Heritage aircraft are made of ancient aluminum alloys, (ply)wood, and particularly fabrics. The decision support system (DSS) designed, starting from a conceptual model, is knowledge-based on degradation/corrosion mechanisms of prevailing materials of aeronautical heritage. In the case of historical aircraft wooden parts, this knowledge base is filled in by the damage function models developed within former European projects. Model-based corrosion prediction is implemented within the new DSS for ancient aluminum alloys. The novelty of this DSS consists of supporting multi-material heritage protection and tailoring to peculiarities of aircraft exhibition/storage hangars and the needs of aviation museums. The novel DSS is tested on WWII aircraft heritage exhibited in the Aviation Museum Kbely, Military History Institute Prague, Czech Republic.

Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function (IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2 representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Abstract: Generalist robots must personalize in-the-wild to meet the diverse needs and preferences of long-term users. How can we enable flexible personalization without sacrificing safety or competency? This paper proposes Coloring Between the Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible, active, and safe robot personalization. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/cbtl/

<title>Prompt Tuning Vision Language Models with Margin Regularizer for Few-Shot Learning under Distribution Shifts</title>

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer. Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets, with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) furnish accurate nonlinear predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty. However, the typical GP setup has a built-in stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent "level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a) learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of (a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the recent literature.

Abstract: Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations can be used to train transformer-based models that have the potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating, distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x (lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer. Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer reduction in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance. AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/nynu-BDAI/AHNPL.

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving. However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval, premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/Laser.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable potential in various natural language tasks but face significant challenges in mathematical reasoning, particularly in executing precise, multi-step logic. However, current evaluation frameworks judge their performance solely based on accuracy, which only accounts for the final answer. This study explores these pitfalls by employing a novel evaluation framework. We propose an evaluation metric called the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible. While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our automatic metric.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information retrieval, and databases. For high-dimensional datasets, graph-based methods such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way to improve the performance of popular methods.

Abstract: Optimal decision tree (\odt) is a fundamental problem arising in applications such as active learning, entity identification, and medical diagnosis. An instance of \odt is given by $m$ hypotheses, out of which an unknown ``true'' hypothesis is drawn according to some probability distribution. An algorithm needs to identify the true hypothesis by making queries: each query incurs a cost and has a known response for each hypothesis. The goal is to minimize the expected query cost to identify the true hypothesis. We consider the most general setting with arbitrary costs, probabilities and responses. \odt is NP-hard to approximate better than $\ln m$ and there are $O(\ln m)$ approximation algorithms known for it. However, these algorithms and/or their analyses are quite complex. Moreover, the leading constant factors are large. We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for \odt, proving an approximation ratio of $8 \ln m$.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{F}$uture $\textbf{LA}$tent $\textbf{RE}$presentation Alignment ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel framework that integrates predictive latent world modeling into robot policy learning. By aligning features from a diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future observations, $\textbf{FLARE}$ enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term consequences while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, $\textbf{FLARE}$ requires only minimal architectural modifications -- adding a few tokens to standard vision-language-action (VLA) models -- yet delivers substantial performance gains. Across two challenging multitask simulation imitation learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid tabletop manipulation, $\textbf{FLARE}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, $\textbf{FLARE}$ unlocks the ability to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations without action labels, significantly boosting policy generalization to a novel object with unseen geometry with as few as a single robot demonstration. Our results establish $\textbf{FLARE}$ as a general and scalable approach for combining implicit world modeling with high-frequency robotic control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance ("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500 prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance on the standard BERT-base model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view. HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally, to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are available at https://github.com/Nick-Zheng-Q/HDLxGraph.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses, overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR), a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon publication.

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, there is a growing emphasis placed on making them interpretable to improve trust in these systems. In response, a range of interpretable machine learning (IML) methods have been developed to generate human-understandable insights into otherwise black box models. With these methods, a fundamental question arises: Are these interpretations reliable? Unlike with prediction accuracy or other evaluation metrics for supervised models, the proximity to the true interpretation is difficult to define. Instead, we ask a closely related question that we argue is a prerequisite for reliability: Are these interpretations stable? We define stability as findings that are consistent or reliable under small random perturbations to the data or algorithms. In this study, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale empirical stability study on popular machine learning global interpretations for both supervised and unsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our findings reveal that popular interpretation methods are frequently unstable, notably less stable than the predictions themselves, and that there is no association between the accuracy of machine learning predictions and the stability of their associated interpretations. Moreover, we show that no single method consistently provides the most stable interpretations across a range of benchmark datasets. Overall, these results suggest that interpretability alone does not warrant trust, and underscores the need for rigorous evaluation of interpretation stability in future work. To support these principles, we have developed and released an open source IML dashboard and Python package to enable researchers to assess the stability and reliability of their own data-driven interpretations and discoveries.

However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities.

<title>Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Gradual Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (Gradual AA-CBR), a data-driven, neurosymbolic classification model in which the outcome is determined by an argumentation debate structure that is learned simultaneously with neural-based feature extractors. Each argument in the debate is an observed case from the training data, favouring their labelling. Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning, improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs). Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance, assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and does not require binary features. We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming existing AA-CBR formulations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics, contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon publication.

Abstract: This work explores transfer learning from several synthetic languages to English. We investigate the structure of the embeddings in the fine-tuned models, the information they contain, and the capabilities of the fine-tuned models on simple linguistic tasks. We also introduce a new synthetic language that leads to better transfer to English than the languages used in previous research. Finally, we introduce Tiny-Cloze Benchmark - a new synthetic benchmark for natural language understanding that is more informative for less powerful models. We use Tiny-Cloze Benchmark to evaluate fine-tuned models in several domains demonstrating that fine-tuning on a new synthetic language allows for better performance on a variety of tasks.

<title>Beyond Hard and Soft: Hybrid Context Compression for Balancing Local and Global Information Retention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15774</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or encode context into latent representations for soft global compression. However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover, HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token consumption by 88.8\%.

<title>VARD: Efficient and Dense Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Models with Value-based RL</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.

Abstract: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack, with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%, providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

<title>HCRMP: A LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However, current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance. Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space. Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3% under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation. While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process. Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language models.

Abstract: When an agent, person, vehicle or robot is moving through an unknown environment without GNSS signals, online mapping of nonlinear terrains can be used to improve position estimates when the agent returns to a previously mapped area. Mapping algorithms using online Gaussian process (GP) regression are commonly integrated in algorithms for simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). However, GP mapping algorithms have increasing computational demands as the mapped area expands relative to spatial field variations. This is due to the need for estimating an increasing amount of map parameters as the area of the map grows. Contrary to this, we propose a recursive GP mapping estimation algorithm which uses local basis functions in an information filter to achieve spatial scalability. Our proposed approximation employs a global grid of finite support basis functions but restricts computations to a localized subset around each prediction point. As our proposed algorithm is recursive, it can naturally be incorporated into existing algorithms that uses Gaussian process maps for SLAM. Incorporating our proposed algorithm into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for magnetic field SLAM reduces the overall computational complexity of the algorithm. We show experimentally that our algorithm is faster than existing methods when the mapped area is large and the map is based on many measurements, both for recursive mapping tasks and for magnetic field SLAM.

Abstract: Linear trajectory models provide mathematical advantages to autonomous driving applications such as motion prediction. However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.

Abstract: Many Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) leverage the OWASP CRS to block incoming malicious requests. The CRS consists of different sets of rules designed by domain experts to detect well-known web attack patterns. Both the set of rules and the weights used to combine them are manually defined, yielding four different default configurations of the CRS. In this work, we focus on the detection of SQLi attacks, and show that the manual configurations of the CRS typically yield a suboptimal trade-off between detection and false alarm rates. Furthermore, we show that these configurations are not robust to adversarial SQLi attacks, i.e., carefully-crafted attacks that iteratively refine the malicious SQLi payload by querying the target WAF to bypass detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose (i) using machine learning to automate the selection of the set of rules to be combined along with their weights, i.e., customizing the CRS configuration based on the monitored web services; and (ii) leveraging adversarial training to significantly improve its robustness to adversarial SQLi manipulations. Our experiments, conducted using the well-known open-source ModSecurity WAF equipped with the CRS rules, show that our approach, named ModSec-AdvLearn, can (i) increase the detection rate up to 30%, while retaining negligible false alarm rates and discarding up to 50% of the CRS rules; and (ii) improve robustness against adversarial SQLi attacks up to 85%, marking a significant stride toward designing more effective and robust WAFs. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/pralab/modsec-advlearn.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic tropical cyclone(TC) tracks for risk assessment is a critical application of preparedness for the impacts of climate change and disaster relief, particularly in North America. Insurance companies use these synthetic tracks to estimate the potential risks and financial impacts of future TCs. For governments and policymakers, understanding the potential impacts of TCs helps in developing effective emergency response strategies, updating building codes, and prioritizing investments in resilience and mitigation projects. In this study, many hypothetical but plausible TC scenarios are created based on historical TC data HURDAT2 (HURricane DATA 2nd generation). A hybrid methodology, combining the ARIMA and K-MEANS methods with Autoencoder, is employed to capture better historical TC behaviors and project future trajectories and intensities. It demonstrates an efficient and reliable in the field of climate modeling and risk assessment. By effectively capturing past hurricane patterns and providing detailed future projections, this approach not only validates the reliability of this method but also offers crucial insights for a range of applications, from disaster preparedness and emergency management to insurance risk analysis and policy formulation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models can improve task specific performance, although a general understanding of what the fine-tuned model has learned, forgotten and how to trust its predictions is still missing. We derive principled uncertainty quantification for fine-tuned LLMs with posterior approximations using computationally efficient low-rank adaptation ensembles. We analyze three common multiple-choice datasets using low-rank adaptation ensembles based on Mistral-7b, and draw quantitative and qualitative conclusions on their perceived complexity and balance between retained prior knowledge and domain specific adaptation during and after fine-tuning. We identify unexpected retention of acquired knowledge during fine-tuning in the overfitting regime.

Abstract: Given time series data, how can we answer questions like "what will happen in the future?" and "how did we get here?" These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.

Abstract: Planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. Metaheuristic algorithms search through the space of possible transit networks by applying heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning to train a graph neural net to provide heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm. These neural heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state-action spaces remains challenging in scientific computing due to poor sample efficiency and lack of pathwise physical consistency. We introduce Differential Reinforcement Learning (Differential RL), a novel framework that reformulates RL from a continuous-time control perspective via a differential dual formulation. This induces a Hamiltonian structure that embeds physics priors and ensures consistent trajectories without requiring explicit constraints. To implement Differential RL, we develop Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise, stage-wise algorithm that refines local movement operators along the trajectory for improved sample efficiency and dynamic alignment. We establish pointwise convergence guarantees, a property not available in standard RL, and derive a competitive theoretical regret bound of $O(K^{5/6})$. Empirically, DPO outperforms standard RL baselines on representative scientific computing tasks, including surface modeling, grid control, and molecular dynamics, under low-data and physics-constrained conditions.

Abstract: In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.

Abstract: The backpropagation algorithm remains the dominant and most successful method for training deep neural networks (DNNs). At the same time, training DNNs at scale comes at a significant computational cost and therefore a high carbon footprint. Converging evidence suggests that input decorrelation may speed up deep learning. However, to date, this has not yet translated into substantial improvements in training efficiency in large-scale DNNs. This is mainly caused by the challenge of enforcing fast and stable network-wide decorrelation. Here, we show for the first time that much more efficient training of deep convolutional neural networks is feasible by embracing decorrelated backpropagation as a mechanism for learning. To achieve this goal we made use of a novel algorithm which induces network-wide input decorrelation using minimal computational overhead. By combining this algorithm with careful optimizations, we achieve a more than two-fold speed-up and higher test accuracy compared to backpropagation when training several deep networks up to a 50-layer ResNet model. This demonstrates that decorrelation provides exciting prospects for efficient deep learning at scale.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. While numerous approaches have been developed, they can be broadly categorized into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and decentralized training and execution (DTE). CTE methods assume centralization during training and execution (e.g., with fast, free, and perfect communication) and have the most information during execution. CTDE methods are the most common, as they leverage centralized information during training while enabling decentralized execution -- using only information available to that agent during execution. Decentralized training and execution methods make the fewest assumptions and are often simple to implement.
  This text is an introduction to cooperative MARL -- MARL in which all agents share a single, joint reward. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods for the CTE, CTDE, and DTE settings. It does not cover all work in cooperative MARL as the area is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the area and apologize to those that I have omitted. Topics include simple applications of single-agent methods to CTE as well as some more scalable methods that exploit the multi-agent structure, independent Q-learning and policy gradient methods and their extensions, as well as value function factorization methods including the well-known VDN, QMIX, and QPLEX approaches, and centralized critic methods including MADDPG, COMA, and MAPPO. I also discuss common misconceptions, the relationship between different approaches, and some open questions.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures consisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 87% for $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of MOFs.

Abstract: Spurious correlations in training data significantly hinder the generalization capability of machine learning models when faced with distribution shifts, leading to the proposition of numberous debiasing methods. However, it remains to be asked: \textit{Do existing benchmarks for debiasing really represent biases in the real world?} Recent works attempt to address such concerns by sampling from real-world data (instead of synthesizing) according to some predefined biased distributions to ensure the realism of individual samples. However, the realism of the biased distribution is more critical yet challenging and underexplored due to the complexity of real-world bias distributions. To tackle the problem, we propose a fine-grained framework for analyzing biased distributions, based on which we empirically and theoretically identify key characteristics of biased distributions in the real world that are poorly represented by existing benchmarks. Towards applicable debiasing in the real world, we further introduce two novel real-world-inspired biases to bridge this gap and build a systematic evaluation framework for real-world debiasing, RDBench\footnote{RDBench: Code to be released. Preliminary version in supplementary material for anonimized review.}. Furthermore, focusing on the practical setting of debiasing w/o bias label, we find real-world biases pose a novel \textit{Sparse bias capturing} challenge to the existing paradigm. We propose a simple yet effective approach named Debias in Destruction (DiD), to address the challenge, whose effectiveness is validated with extensive experiments on 8 datasets of various biased distributions.

<title>A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs</title>

Abstract: Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.

<title>DEFT: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models by Learning the Generalised $h$-transform</title>

Abstract: Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.

<title>Flexible Heteroscedastic Count Regression with Deep Double Poisson Networks</title>

Abstract: Neural networks that can produce accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representations are critical for real-world applications. Recent progress on heteroscedastic continuous regression has shown great promise for calibrated uncertainty quantification on complex tasks, like image regression. However, when these methods are applied to discrete regression tasks, such as crowd counting, ratings prediction, or inventory estimation, they tend to produce predictive distributions with numerous pathologies. Moreover, discrete models based on the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework either cannot process complex input or are not fully heterosedastic. To address these issues we propose the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN). In contrast to networks trained to minimize Gaussian negative log likelihood (NLL), discrete network parameterizations (i.e., Poisson, Negative binomial), and GLMs, DDPN can produce discrete predictive distributions of arbitrary flexibility. Additionally, we propose a technique to tune the prioritization of mean fit and probabilistic calibration during training. We show DDPN 1) vastly outperforms existing discrete models; 2) meets or exceeds the accuracy and flexibility of networks trained with Gaussian NLL; 3) produces proper predictive distributions over discrete counts; and 4) exhibits superior out-of-distribution detection. DDPN can easily be applied to a variety of count regression datasets including tabular, image, point cloud, and text data.

Abstract: The synthesis of product design concepts stands at the crux of early-phase development processes for technical products, traditionally posing an intricate interdisciplinary challenge. The application of deep learning methods, particularly Deep Generative Models (DGMs), holds the promise of automating and streamlining manual iterations and therefore introducing heightened levels of innovation and efficiency. However, DGMs have yet to be widely adopted into the synthesis of product design concepts. This paper aims to explore the reasons behind this limited application and derive the requirements for successful integration of these technologies. We systematically analyze DGM-families (VAE, GAN, Diffusion, Transformer, Radiance Field), assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and general applicability for product design conception. Our objective is to provide insights that simplify the decision-making process for engineers, helping them determine which method might be most effective for their specific challenges. Recognizing the rapid evolution of this field, we hope that our analysis contributes to a fundamental understanding and guides practitioners towards the most promising approaches. This work seeks not only to illuminate current challenges but also to propose potential solutions, thereby offering a clear roadmap for leveraging DGMs in the realm of product design conception.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large foundation models, leveraging low-rank matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to represent weight changes (i.e., $\Delta \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$). This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially multiplying $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with the activation. Despite its success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance. Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C$^3$A), which not only achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^3$A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various fine-tuning tasks.

Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data. To address this, we present a pilot study on using reinforcement learning (RL) for time series data augmentation. Our method, ReAugment, tackles three critical questions: which parts of the training set should be augmented, how the augmentation should be performed, and what advantages RL brings to the process. Specifically, our approach maintains a forecasting model zoo, and by measuring prediction diversity across the models, we identify samples with higher probabilities for overfitting and use them as the anchor points for augmentation. Leveraging RL, our method adaptively transforms the overfit-prone samples into new data that not only enhances training set diversity but also directs the augmented data to target regions where the forecasting models are prone to overfitting. We validate the effectiveness of ReAugment across a wide range of base models, showing its advantages in both standard time series forecasting and few-shot learning tasks.

Abstract: Models initialized from self-supervised pretraining may suffer from poor alignment with downstream tasks, reducing the extent to which subsequent fine-tuning can adapt pretrained features toward downstream objectives. To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.

Abstract: Federated graph learning is an emerging field with significant practical challenges. While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark different FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.

Abstract: The Universality Hypothesis in large language models (LLMs) claims that different models converge towards similar concept representations in their latent spaces. Providing evidence for this hypothesis would enable researchers to exploit universal properties, facilitating the generalization of mechanistic interpretability techniques across models. Previous works studied if LLMs learned the same features, which are internal representations that activate on specific concepts. Since comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which LLM neurons often correspond to multiple unrelated features rather than to distinct concepts, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been employed to disentangle LLM neurons into SAE features corresponding to distinct concepts. In this paper, we introduce a new variation of the universality hypothesis called Analogous Feature Universality: we hypothesize that even if SAEs across different models learn different feature representations, the spaces spanned by SAE features are similar, such that one SAE space is similar to another SAE space under rotation-invariant transformations. Evidence for this hypothesis would imply that interpretability techniques related to latent spaces, such as steering vectors, may be transferred across models via certain transformations. To investigate this hypothesis, we first pair SAE features across different models via activation correlation, and then measure spatial relation similarities between paired features via representational similarity measures, which transform spaces into representations that reveal hidden relational similarities. Our experiments demonstrate high similarities for SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing evidence for feature space universality.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters, while maintaining or improving downstream performance. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.

Abstract: Local learning, which trains a network through layer-wise local targets and losses, has been studied as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) in neural computation. However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.

Abstract: In real-world data, information is stored in extremely large feature vectors. These variables are typically correlated due to complex interactions involving many features simultaneously. Such correlations qualitatively correspond to semantic roles and are naturally recognized by both the human brain and artificial neural networks. This recognition enables, for instance, the prediction of missing parts of an image or text based on their context. We present a method to detect these correlations in high-dimensional data represented as binary numbers. We estimate the binary intrinsic dimension of a dataset, which quantifies the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to describe the data, and is therefore a proxy of semantic complexity. The proposed algorithm is largely insensitive to the so-called curse of dimensionality, and can therefore be used in big data analysis. We test this approach identifying phase transitions in model magnetic systems and we then apply it to the detection of semantic correlations of images and text inside deep neural networks.

Abstract: Modern deep policy gradient methods achieve effective performance on simulated robotic tasks, but they all require large replay buffers or expensive batch updates, or both, making them incompatible for real systems with resource-limited computers. We show that these methods fail catastrophically when limited to small replay buffers or during incremental learning, where updates only use the most recent sample without batch updates or a replay buffer. We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method -- Action Value Gradient (AVG) and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods. This advancement enabled us to show for the first time effective deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, employing a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot.

Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.

Abstract: Satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification is crucial for space safety and satellite monitoring, involving the analysis of typical satellite behaviors such as station-keeping, drift, etc. However, existing PoL identification methods remain underdeveloped due to the complexity of aerospace systems, variability in satellite behaviors, and fluctuating observation sampling rates. In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.

Abstract: Data corruption, including missing and noisy data, poses significant challenges in real-world machine learning. This study investigates the effects of data corruption on model performance and explores strategies to mitigate these effects through two experimental setups: supervised learning with NLP tasks (NLP-SL) and deep reinforcement learning for traffic signal optimization (Signal-RL). We analyze the relationship between data corruption levels and model performance, evaluate the effectiveness of data imputation methods, and assess the utility of enlarging datasets to address data corruption.
  Our results show that model performance under data corruption follows a diminishing return curve, modeled by the exponential function. Missing data, while detrimental, is less harmful than noisy data, which causes severe performance degradation and training instability, particularly in sequential decision-making tasks like Signal-RL. Imputation strategies involve a trade-off: they recover missing information but may introduce noise. Their effectiveness depends on imputation accuracy and corruption ratio. We identify distinct regions in the imputation advantage heatmap, including an "imputation advantageous corner" and an "imputation disadvantageous edge" and classify tasks as "noise-sensitive" or "noise-insensitive" based on their decision boundaries.
  Furthermore, we find that increasing dataset size mitigates but cannot fully overcome the effects of data corruption. The marginal utility of additional data diminishes as corruption increases. An empirical rule emerges: approximately 30% of the data is critical for determining performance, while the remaining 70% has minimal impact.
  These findings provide actionable insights into data preprocessing, imputation strategies, and data collection practices, guiding the development of robust machine learning systems in noisy environments.

Abstract: Background: Radiation pneumonitis is a side effect of thoracic radiation therapy. Recently, machine learning models with radiomic features have improved radiation pneumonitis prediction by capturing spatial information. To further support clinical decision-making, this study explores the role of post hoc uncertainty quantification methods in enhancing model uncertainty estimate. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 101 esophageal cancer patients. This study evaluated four machine learning models: logistic regression, support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest, using 15 dosimetric, 79 dosiomic, and 237 radiomic features to predict radiation pneumonitis. We applied uncertainty quantification methods, including Platt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and conformal prediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and adaptive calibration error using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Highest AUROC is achieved by the logistic regression model with the conformal prediction method (AUROC 0.75+-0.01, AUPRC 0.74+-0.01) at a certainty cut point of 0.8. Highest AUPRC of 0.82+-0.02 (with AUROC of 0.67+-0.04) achieved by The extreme gradient boosting model with conformal prediction at the 0.9 certainty threshold. Radiomic and dosiomic features improve both discriminative and calibration performance. Conclusions: Integrating uncertainty quantification into machine learning models with radiomic and dosiomic features may improve both predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the value of uncertainty quantification methods in enhancing applicability of predictive models for radiation pneumonitis in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Monotone learning describes learning processes in which expected performance consistently improves as the amount of training data increases. However, recent studies challenge this conventional wisdom, revealing significant gaps in the understanding of generalization in machine learning. Addressing these gaps is crucial for advancing the theoretical foundations of the field. In this work, we utilize Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory to construct a theoretical risk distribution that approximates a learning algorithm's actual performance. We rigorously prove that this theoretical distribution exhibits monotonicity as sample sizes increase. We identify two scenarios under which deterministic algorithms based on Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are monotone: (1) the hypothesis space is finite, or (2) the hypothesis space has finite VC-dimension. Experiments on two classical learning problems validate our findings by demonstrating that the monotonicity of the algorithms' generalization error is guaranteed, as its theoretical risk upper bound monotonically converges to 0.

Abstract: Predictive models are highly advanced in understanding the mechanisms of brain function. Recent advances in machine learning further underscore the power of prediction for optimal representation in learning. However, there remains a gap in creating a biologically plausible model that explains how the neural system achieves prediction. In this paper, we introduce a framework that employs an energy-based model (EBM) to capture the nuanced processes of predicting observation after action within the neural system, encompassing prediction, learning, and inference. We implement the EBM with a hierarchical structure and integrate a continuous attractor neural network for memory, constructing a biologically plausible model. In experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates efficacy across diverse scenarios. The range of actions includes eye movement, motion in environments, head turning, and static observation while the environment changes. Our model not only makes accurate predictions for environments it was trained on, but also provides reasonable predictions for unseen environments, matching the performances of machine learning methods in multiple tasks. We hope that this study contributes to a deep understanding of how the neural system performs prediction.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration of pre-trained models is critical for ensuring reliable inference, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a robust post-hoc calibration framework, providing distribution-free statistical coverage guarantees for prediction sets by leveraging held-out datasets. In this work, we address a decentralized setting where each device has limited calibration data and can communicate only with its neighbors over an arbitrary graph topology. We propose two message-passing-based approaches for achieving reliable inference via CP: quantile-based distributed conformal prediction (Q-DCP) and histogram-based distributed conformal prediction (H-DCP). Q-DCP employs distributed quantile regression enhanced with tailored smoothing and regularization terms to accelerate convergence, while H-DCP uses a consensus-based histogram estimation approach. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the trade-offs between hyperparameter tuning requirements, communication overhead, coverage guarantees, and prediction set sizes across different network topologies. The code of our work is released on: https://github.com/HaifengWen/Distributed-Conformal-Prediction.

Abstract: Recently, optimal transport-based approaches have gained attention for deriving counterfactuals, e.g., to quantify algorithmic discrimination. However, in the general multivariate setting, these methods are often opaque and difficult to interpret. To address this, alternative methodologies have been proposed, using causal graphs combined with iterative quantile regressions (Ple\v{c}ko and Meinshausen (2020)) or sequential transport (Fernandes Machado et al. (2025)) to examine fairness at the individual level, often referred to as ``counterfactual fairness.'' Despite these advancements, transporting categorical variables remains a significant challenge in practical applications with real datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this issue. Our method involves (1) converting categorical variables into compositional data and (2) transporting these compositions within the probabilistic simplex of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of this approach through an illustration on real-world data, and discuss limitations.

Abstract: For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to select the width of neural networks' layers. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, text, sequences, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. The method imposes a soft ordering of importance among neurons, by which it also is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to humongous training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.

<title>From Low Intrinsic Dimensionality to Non-Vacuous Generalization Bounds in Deep Multi-Task Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep learning methods are known to generalize well from training to future data, even in an overparametrized regime, where they could easily overfit. One explanation for this phenomenon is that even when their *ambient dimensionality*, (i.e. the number of parameters) is large, the models' *intrinsic dimensionality* is small; specifically, their learning takes place in a small subspace of all possible weight configurations. In this work, we confirm this phenomenon in the setting of *deep multi-task learning*. We introduce a method to parametrize multi-task network directly in the low-dimensional space, facilitated by the use of *random expansions* techniques. We then show that high-accuracy multi-task solutions can be found with much smaller intrinsic dimensionality (fewer free parameters) than what single-task learning requires. Subsequently, we show that the low-dimensional representations in combination with *weight compression* and *PAC-Bayesian* reasoning lead to the *first non-vacuous generalization bounds* for deep multi-task networks.

Abstract: Dataset contamination, where evaluation datasets overlap with pre-training corpora, inflates performance metrics and undermines the reliability of model evaluations. Measuring dataset contamination thus becomes essential to ensure that performance evaluations genuinely reflect a model's ability to generalize to unseen data, rather than relying on memorized examples. To address this problem, we propose Kernel Divergence Score (KDS), a novel method that evaluates dataset contamination by computing the divergence between the kernel similarity matrix of sample embeddings, before and after fine-tuning on the benchmark dataset. Leveraging the insight that fine-tuning affects unseen samples more significantly than seen ones, KDS provides a reliable measure of contamination. Through extensive experiments on controlled contamination scenarios, KDS demonstrates a near-perfect correlation with contamination levels and outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of key design choices, providing deeper insights into the components and effectiveness of KDS. These ablations highlight the importance of leveraging fine-grained kernel-based information and confirm the reliability of the proposed framework across diverse datasets and settings. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/kernel-divergence-score.

<title>FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression method designed to reduce latency for long-context inference. FastKV improves processing speed while preserving accuracy by adopting Token-Selective Propagation (TSP). This approach preserves full-context information in early layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only a portion of this information in later layers. This design enables FastKV to minimize redundant computation without sacrificing contextual fidelity. Our experimental results show that FastKV achieves up to 1.97$\times$ and 4.82$\times$ improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to baseline without KV cache compression. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy within 1\% of the baseline on long-context benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

Abstract: Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel framework for privately optimizing objectives that rely on Wasserstein distances between data-dependent empirical measures. Our main theoretical contribution is, based on an explicit formulation of the Wasserstein gradient in a fully discrete setting, a control on the sensitivity of this gradient to individual data points, allowing strong privacy guarantees at minimal utility cost. Building on these insights, we develop a deep learning approach that incorporates gradient and activations clipping, originally designed for DP training of problems with a finite-sum structure. We further demonstrate that privacy accounting methods extend to Wasserstein-based objectives, facilitating large-scale private training. Empirical results confirm that our framework effectively balances accuracy and privacy, offering a theoretically sound solution for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks relying on optimal transport distances such as Wasserstein distance or sliced-Wasserstein distance.

SDD extends continuous state-space diffusion models with an explicit representation of exact zeros by modeling sparsity through the introduction of Sparsity Bits. Empirical validation in various domains, including two scientific applications in physics and biology, demonstrates that SDD achieves high fidelity in representing data sparsity while preserving the quality of the generated data.

Abstract: Many deep architectures and self-supervised pre-training techniques have been proposed for human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable multimodal sensors. Scaling laws have the potential to help move towards more principled design by linking model capacity with pre-training data volume. Yet, scaling laws have not been established for HAR to the same extent as in language and vision. By conducting an exhaustive grid search on both amount of pre-training data and Transformer architectures, we establish the first known scaling laws for HAR. We show that pre-training loss scales with a power law relationship to amount of data and parameter count and that increasing the number of users in a dataset results in a steeper improvement in performance than increasing data per user, indicating that diversity of pre-training data is important, which contrasts to some previously reported findings in self-supervised HAR. We show that these scaling laws translate to downstream performance improvements on three HAR benchmark datasets of postures, modes of locomotion and activities of daily living: UCI HAR and WISDM Phone and WISDM Watch. Finally, we suggest some previously published works should be revisited in light of these scaling laws with more adequate model capacities.

We introduce a modified transformer architecture that incorporates learned normalization and simultaneous set-wise attention to user history and ranked items. This architecture enables several breakthrough achievements, including: (1) the deprecation of most manually designed feature engineering, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art system using only few features (compared to hundreds in the baseline), (2) validation of the scaling law for ranking systems, showing improved performance with larger models, more training data, and longer context sequences, and (3) simultaneous joint scoring of items in a set-wise manner, leading to automated improvements in diversity. To enable efficient serving of large ranking models, we describe techniques to scale inference effectively using single-pass processing of user history and set-wise attention. We also summarize key insights from various ablation studies and A/B tests, highlighting the most impactful technical approaches.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.

Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing in the nonlinear setting without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.

Abstract: Link prediction for directed graphs is a crucial task with diverse real-world applications. Recent advances in embedding methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising improvements. However, these methods often lack a thorough analysis of their expressiveness and suffer from effective benchmarks for a fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to assess the expressiveness of existing methods, highlighting the impact of dual embeddings and decoder design on directed link prediction performance. To address limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a robust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and modular extensibility. The results on DirLinkBench show that current methods struggle to achieve strong performance, while DiGAE outperforms other baselines overall. We further revisit DiGAE theoretically, showing its graph convolution aligns with GCN on an undirected bipartite graph. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel Spectral Directed Graph Auto-Encoder SDGAE that achieves state-of-the-art average performance on DirLinkBench. Finally, we analyze key factors influencing directed link prediction and highlight open challenges in this field.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their trustworthiness and utility. Prior work has primarily focused on mapping individual neurons to discrete semantic concepts. However, such mappings struggle to handle the inherent polysemanticity in LLMs, where individual neurons encode multiple, distinct concepts. Through a comprehensive analysis of both encoder and decoder-based LLMs across diverse datasets, we observe that even highly salient neurons, identified via various attribution techniques for specific semantic concepts, consistently exhibit polysemantic behavior. Importantly, activation magnitudes for fine-grained concepts follow distinct, often Gaussian-like distributions with minimal overlap. This observation motivates a shift from neuron attribution to range-based interpretation. We hypothesize that interpreting and manipulating neuron activation ranges would enable more precise interpretability and targeted interventions in LLMs. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce NeuronLens, a novel range-based interpretation and manipulation framework that provides a finer view of neuron activation distributions to localize concept attribution within a neuron. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuronLens significantly reduces unintended interference, while maintaining precise manipulation of targeted concepts, outperforming neuron attribution.

Abstract: Medication adherence is critical for the recovery of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, maintaining adherence is challenging for AYAs after hospital discharge, who experience both individual (e.g. physical and emotional symptoms) and interpersonal barriers (e.g., relational difficulties with their care partner, who is often involved in medication management). To optimize the effectiveness of a three-component digital intervention targeting both members of the dyad as well as their relationship, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach to personalize the delivery of interventions. By incorporating the domain knowledge, the MARL framework, where each agent is responsible for the delivery of one intervention component, allows for faster learning compared with a flattened agent. Evaluation using a dyadic simulator environment, based on real clinical data, shows a significant improvement in medication adherence (approximately 3%) compared to purely random intervention delivery. The effectiveness of this approach will be further evaluated in an upcoming trial.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has traditionally emphasized minimizing exemplar memory usage, assuming that memory is the primary bottleneck. However, in modern computing environments-particularly those involving large foundation models-memory is inexpensive and abundant, while GPU time constitutes the main cost. This paper re-examines CL under a more realistic setting with sufficient exemplar memory, where the system can retain a representative portion of past data. We find that, under this regime, stability improves due to reduced forgetting, but plasticity diminishes as the model becomes biased toward prior tasks and struggles to adapt to new ones. Notably, even simple baselines like naive replay can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Building on this insight, we propose a lightweight yet effective method called Weight Space Consolidation, which directly operates in the model's weight space via two core mechanisms: (1) rank-based parameter resets to recover plasticity, and (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Our approach outperforms strong baselines across class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, while requiring only one-third to one-fourth of the training cost. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world continual learning systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) methods have enabled vision-language model (VLM) agents to learn from interaction with online environments without human supervision. However, these methods often struggle with learning inefficiencies when applied to complex, real-world decision-making tasks with sparse rewards and long-horizon dependencies. We propose a novel framework, Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (VSC-RL), advancing the VLM agents in resolving challenging decision-making tasks. Fundamentally distinct from existing methods, VSC-RL reformulates the decision-making problem as a variational subgoal-conditioned RL problem with the newly derived optimization objective, Subgoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which comprises two key components: (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return, and (b) minimizing the divergence from a reference goal-conditioned policy. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the VSC-RL can efficiently improve the learning efficiency without compromising performance guarantees. Across a diverse set of challenging benchmarks, including mobile device and web control tasks, VSC-RL consistently outperforms existing SOTA methods, achieving superior learning efficiency and performance.

<title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>

Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.

Abstract: In the past year, large (>100B parameter) mixture-of-expert (MoE) models have become increasingly common in the open domain. While their advantages are often framed in terms of efficiency, prior work has also explored functional differentiation through routing behavior. We investigate whether expert routing in large MoE models is influenced by the semantics of the inputs. To test this, we design two controlled experiments. First, we compare activations on sentence pairs with a shared target word used in the same or different senses. Second, we fix context and substitute the target word with semantically similar or dissimilar alternatives. Comparing expert overlap across these conditions reveals clear, statistically significant evidence of semantic routing in large MoE models.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data is a prevalent practice in code generation. A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks. Source code is available at https://github.com/Alex-HaochenLi/GiFT.

Abstract: Generative models are spearheading recent progress in deep learning, showcasing strong promise for trajectory sampling in dynamical systems as well. However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/LaM-SLidE .

Abstract: Post-training Quantization (PTQ) technique has been extensively adopted for large language models (LLMs) compression owing to its efficiency and low resource requirement. However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.

Abstract: The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. Our study presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP utilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In addition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in multimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome the limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the InfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with InfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing distributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and by inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into markdown-formatted plain text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, a population distinct from that used to train CLMBR-T-Base. Notably, one of the tested LLM-based models achieves superior performance for disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality prediction, highlighting robustness to shifts in patient populations. Our findings suggest that repurposed general-purpose LLMs for EHR encoding provide a scalable and generalizable alternative to domain-specific models for clinical prediction.

Abstract: As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.

Abstract: We propose an efficient fine-tuning method for time series foundation models, termed TRACE: Time Series Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning. While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics.
  To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts.
  Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting, anomaly detection and natural language tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We find that the Thinking Intervention paradigm enhances the capabilities of reasoning models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction following on IFEval and Overthinking, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SorryBench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its outstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the practical effectiveness of PPGT.

Abstract: We develop a linear response framework for interpretability that treats a neural network as a Bayesian statistical mechanical system. A small perturbation of the data distribution, for example shifting the Pile toward GitHub or legal text, induces a first-order change in the posterior expectation of an observable localized on a chosen component of the network. The resulting susceptibility can be estimated efficiently with local SGLD samples and factorizes into signed, per-token contributions that serve as attribution scores. We combine these susceptibilities into a response matrix whose low-rank structure separates functional modules such as multigram and induction heads in a 3M-parameter transformer.

Abstract: Existing protein-ligand docking studies typically focus on the self-docking scenario, which is less practical in real applications. Moreover, some studies involve heavy frameworks requiring extensive training, posing challenges for convenient and efficient assessment of docking methods. To fill these gaps, we design PoseX, an open-source benchmark to evaluate both self-docking and cross-docking, enabling a practical and comprehensive assessment of algorithmic advances. Specifically, we curated a novel dataset comprising 718 entries for self-docking and 1,312 entries for cross-docking; second, we incorporated 23 docking methods in three methodological categories, including physics-based methods (e.g., Schr\"odinger Glide), AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock) and AI co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we developed a relaxation method for post-processing to minimize conformational energy and refine binding poses; fourth, we built a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real-time. We derived some key insights and conclusions from extensive experiments: (1) AI approaches have consistently outperformed physics-based methods in overall docking success rate. (2) Most intra- and intermolecular clashes of AI approaches can be greatly alleviated with relaxation, which means combining AI modeling with physics-based post-processing could achieve excellent performance. (3) AI co-folding methods exhibit ligand chirality issues, except for Boltz-1x, which introduced physics-inspired potentials to fix hallucinations, suggesting modeling on stereochemistry improves the structural plausibility markedly. (4) Specifying binding pockets significantly promotes docking performance, indicating that pocket information can be leveraged adequately, particularly for AI co-folding methods, in future modeling efforts. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are released at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.

Abstract: The integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology in 6G Internet of Things (IoT) networks faces significant challenges in remote areas and disaster scenarios where ground infrastructure is unavailable. This paper proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system enhanced by directional antennas to provide both computational resources and energy support for ground IoT terminals. However, such systems require multiple trade-off policies to balance UAV energy consumption, terminal battery levels, and computational resource allocation under various constraints, including limited UAV battery capacity, non-linear energy harvesting characteristics, and dynamic task arrivals. To address these challenges comprehensively, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers system energy efficiency and terminal battery sustainability. We then reformulate this non-convex problem with a hybrid solution space as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose an improved soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with an action simplification mechanism to enhance its convergence and generalization capabilities. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms various baselines in different scenarios, achieving efficient energy management while maintaining high computational performance. Furthermore, our method shows strong generalization ability across different scenarios, particularly in complex environments, validating the effectiveness of our designed boundary penalty and charging reward mechanisms.

<title>Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning Against View Adversarial Attacks</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view learning has attracted extensive attention because evidence learning can provide reliable uncertainty estimation to enhance the credibility of multi-view predictions. Existing trusted multi-view learning methods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. However, in safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security monitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations, thereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view models. This inevitably leads to the adversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To overcome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we first propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into clean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences, which is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the feature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial perturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to further ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level evidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view classification tasks with adversarial attacks show that RDML outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relatively large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/Willy1005/2025-IJCAI-RDML.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritizes the completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/Elastic-Reasoning.

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a specific part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efficiency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) have emerged as promising solutions for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning infinite-dimensional function mappings through frequency domain transformations. However, the sparsity of high-frequency signals limits computational efficiency for high-dimensional inputs, and fixed-pattern truncation often causes high-frequency signal loss, reducing performance in scenarios such as high-resolution inputs or long-term predictions. To address these challenges, we propose FreqMoE, an efficient and progressive training framework that exploits the dependency of high-frequency signals on low-frequency components. The model first learns low-frequency weights and then applies a sparse upward-cycling strategy to construct a mixture of experts (MoE) in the frequency domain, effectively extending the learned weights to high-frequency regions. Experiments on both regular and irregular grid PDEs demonstrate that FreqMoE achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement while using merely 2.1% parameters (47.32x reduction) compared to dense FNO. Furthermore, the approach demonstrates remarkable stability in long-term predictions and generalizes seamlessly to various FNO variants and grid structures, establishing a new ``Low frequency Pretraining, High frequency Fine-tuning'' paradigm for solving PDEs.

Abstract: Reward baseline is important for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through accuracy and rewards obtained from math question answering and reasoning, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL.

<title>Feasibility-Aware Pessimistic Estimation: Toward Long-Horizon Safety in Offline RL</title>

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning(OSRL) derives constraint-satisfying policies from pre-collected datasets, offers a promising avenue for deploying RL in safety-critical real-world domains such as robotics. However, the majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost, which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors. Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation. Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks, particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.

<title>Training NTK to Generalize with KARE</title>

Abstract: The performance of the data-dependent neural tangent kernel (NTK; Jacot et al. (2018)) associated with a trained deep neural network (DNN) often matches or exceeds that of the full network. This implies that DNN training via gradient descent implicitly performs kernel learning by optimizing the NTK. In this paper, we propose instead to optimize the NTK explicitly. Rather than minimizing empirical risk, we train the NTK to minimize its generalization error using the recently developed Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE; Jacot et al. (2020)). Our simulations and real data experiments show that NTKs trained with KARE consistently match or significantly outperform the original DNN and the DNN- induced NTK (the after-kernel). These results suggest that explicitly trained kernels can outperform traditional end-to-end DNN optimization in certain settings, challenging the conventional dominance of DNNs. We argue that explicit training of NTK is a form of over-parametrized feature learning.

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

Abstract: Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of methodological standards causes large variations being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic framework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed quaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their adoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands through the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data samples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different datasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction, segmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination with both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves network performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios and robust to domain shifts.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.

Abstract: A novel approach to approximate solutions of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) by Deep Neural Networks is derived and analysed. The architecture is inspired by the notion of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which is based on operator learning in function spaces in terms of a reduced basis also represented in the network. In our setting, we make use of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) of stochastic processes and call the corresponding architecture SDEONet. The PCE has been used extensively in the area of uncertainty quantification (UQ) with parametric partial differential equations. This however is not the case with SDE, where classical sampling methods dominate and functional approaches are seen rarely. A main challenge with truncated PCEs occurs due to the drastic growth of the number of components with respect to the maximum polynomial degree and the number of basis elements. The proposed SDEONet architecture aims to alleviate the issue of exponential complexity by learning an optimal sparse truncation of the Wiener chaos expansion. A complete convergence and complexity analysis is presented, making use of recent Neural Network approximation results. Numerical experiments illustrate the promising performance of the suggested approach in 1D and higher dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for learning memory kernels in Generalized Langevin Equations. This approach initially utilizes a regularized Prony method to estimate correlation functions from trajectory data, followed by regression over a Sobolev norm-based loss function with RKHS regularization. Our method guarantees improved performance within an exponentially weighted L^2 space, with the kernel estimation error controlled by the error in estimated correlation functions. We demonstrate the superiority of our estimator compared to other regression estimators that rely on L^2 loss functions and also an estimator derived from the inverse Laplace transform, using numerical examples that highlight its consistent advantage across various weight parameter selections. Additionally, we provide examples that include the application of force and drift terms in the equation.

arXiv:2403.16855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the \emph{semantics of information} and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term \textit{state-dependent} costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated as a \emph{constrained Markov decision process} (CMDP). We show that the optimal Lagrangian cost follows a piece-wise linear and concave (PWLC) function, and the optimal policy is, at most, a randomized mixture of two simple deterministic policies. By exploiting the structural results, we develop a new \textit{intersection search} algorithm that finds the optimal policy using only a few iterations. We further propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to compute the optimal policy without knowing \textit{a priori} the channel and source statistics. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality" in MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) algorithm. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.

arXiv:2404.13349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ProFL, a new framework that effectively addresses the memory constraints in FL. Rather than updating the full model during local training, ProFL partitions the model into blocks based on its original architecture and trains each block in a progressive fashion. It first trains the front blocks and safely freezes them after convergence. Training of the next block is then triggered. This process progressively grows the model to be trained until the training of the full model is completed. In this way, the peak memory footprint is effectively reduced for feasible deployment on heterogeneous devices. In order to preserve the feature representation of each block, the training process is divided into two stages: model shrinking and model growing. During the model shrinking stage, we meticulously design corresponding output modules to assist each block in learning the expected feature representation and obtain the initialization model parameters. Subsequently, the obtained output modules and initialization model parameters are utilized in the corresponding model growing stage, which progressively trains the full model. Additionally, a novel metric from the scalar perspective is proposed to assess the learning status of each block, enabling us to securely freeze it after convergence and initiate the training of the next one. Finally, we theoretically prove the convergence of ProFL and conduct extensive experiments on representative models and datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that ProFL effectively reduces the peak memory footprint by up to 57.4% and improves model accuracy by up to 82.4%.

arXiv:2407.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to use a local clustering approach based on the sparse solution technique to study the medical image, especially the lung cancer image classification task. We view images as the vertices in a weighted graph and the similarity between a pair of images as the edges in the graph. The vertices within the same cluster can be assumed to share similar features and properties, thus making the applications of graph clustering techniques very useful for image classification. Recently, the approach based on the sparse solutions of linear systems for graph clustering has been found to identify clusters more efficiently than traditional clustering methods such as spectral clustering. We propose to use the two newly developed local clustering methods based on sparse solution of linear system for image classification. In addition, we employ a box spline-based tight-wavelet-framelet method to clean these images and help build a better adjacency matrix before clustering. The performance of our methods is shown to be very effective in classifying images. Our approach is significantly more efficient and either favorable or equally effective compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we shall make a remark by pointing out two image deformation methods to build up more artificial image data to increase the number of labeled images.

Abstract: Recommender systems have played a critical role in diverse digital services such as e-commerce, streaming media, social networks, etc. If we know what a user's intent is in a given session (e.g. do they want to watch short videos or a movie or play games; are they shopping for a camping trip), it becomes easier to provide high-quality recommendations. In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of IntentRec.

Abstract: LLM app (tool) ecosystems are rapidly evolving to support sophisticated use cases that often require extensive user data collection. Given that LLM apps are developed by third parties and anecdotal evidence indicating inconsistent enforcement of policies by LLM platforms, sharing user data with these apps presents significant privacy risks. In this paper, we aim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM app ecosystems. We examine OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem as a case study. We propose an LLM-based framework to analyze the natural language specifications of GPT Actions (custom tools) and assess their data collection practices. Our analysis reveals that Actions collect excessive data across 24 categories and 145 data types, with third-party Actions collecting 6.03% more data on average. We find that several Actions violate OpenAI's policies by collecting sensitive information, such as passwords, which is explicitly prohibited by OpenAI. Lastly, we develop an LLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the consistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy policies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the collected data types are omitted, with only 5.8% of Actions clearly disclosing their data collection practices.

Abstract: We present a novel three-stage framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a risk-aware multi-agent system for automate strategy finding in quantitative finance. Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) the representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the models ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods, only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o-mini.

Abstract: Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving for periodic soft real-time applications on edge devices. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series data in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to interpret for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization, and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.

Abstract: Orientation estimation is a fundamental task in 3D shape analysis which consists of estimating a shape's orientation axes: its side-, up-, and front-axes. Using this data, one can rotate a shape into canonical orientation, where its orientation axes are aligned with the coordinate axes. Developing an orientation algorithm that reliably estimates complete orientations of general shapes remains an open problem. We introduce a two-stage orientation pipeline that achieves state of the art performance on up-axis estimation and further demonstrate its efficacy on full-orientation estimation, where one seeks all three orientation axes. Unlike previous work, we train and evaluate our method on all of Shapenet rather than a subset of classes. We motivate our engineering contributions by theory describing fundamental obstacles to orientation estimation for rotationally-symmetric shapes, and show how our method avoids these obstacles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/closer-look-LLM-unlearning.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection without additional annotations. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct a multimodal LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.

<title>Bilinear Sequence Regression: A Model for Learning from Long Sequences of High-dimensional Tokens</title>

Abstract: Current progress in artificial intelligence is centered around so-called large language models that consist of neural networks processing long sequences of high-dimensional vectors called tokens. Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (aka generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens, and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.

Abstract: Many common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels can be formulated using a deterministic involutive proposal with a step size parameter. Selecting an appropriate step size is often a challenging task in practice; and for complex multiscale targets, there may not be one choice of step size that works well globally. In this work, we address this problem with a novel class of involutive MCMC methods -- AutoStep MCMC -- that selects an appropriate step size at each iteration adapted to the local geometry of the target distribution. We prove that under mild conditions AutoStep MCMC is $\pi$-invariant, irreducible, and aperiodic, and obtain bounds on expected energy jump distance and cost per iteration. Empirical results examine the robustness and efficacy of our proposed step size selection procedure, and show that AutoStep MCMC is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of effective sample size per unit cost on a range of challenging target distributions.

<title>A Generative Diffusion Model to Solve Inverse Problems for Robust in-NICU Neonatal MRI</title>

Abstract: We present the first acquisition-agnostic diffusion generative model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to solve a range of inverse problems for shortening scan time and improving motion robustness. In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.

Abstract: Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN) demonstrated combining multiple independent enhancements could significantly boost a reinforcement learning (RL) agent's performance. In this paper, we present "Beyond The Rainbow" (BTR), a novel algorithm that integrates six improvements from across the RL literature to Rainbow DQN, establishing a new state-of-the-art for RL using a desktop PC, with a human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) of 7.4 on Atari-60. Beyond Atari, we demonstrate BTR's capability to handle complex 3D games, successfully training agents to play Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart, and Mortal Kombat with minimal algorithmic changes. Designing BTR with computational efficiency in mind, agents can be trained using a high-end desktop PC on 200 million Atari frames within 12 hours. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies of each component, analyzing the performance and impact using numerous measures. Code is available at https://github.com/VIPTankz/BTR.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged as a promising direction to integrate neural and symbolic reasoning. Unfortunately, little effort has been given to developing NeSy systems tailored to sequential/temporal problems. We identify symbolic automata (which combine the power of automata for temporal reasoning with that of propositional logic for static reasoning) as a suitable formalism for expressing knowledge in temporal domains. Focusing on the task of sequence classification and tagging we show that symbolic automata can be integrated with neural-based perception, under probabilistic semantics towards an end-to-end differentiable model. Our proposed hybrid model, termed NeSyA (Neuro Symbolic Automata) is shown to either scale or perform more accurately than previous NeSy systems in a synthetic benchmark and to provide benefits in terms of generalization compared to purely neural systems in a real-world event recognition task.

Abstract: Discovering customer intentions in dialogue conversations is crucial for automated service agents. However, existing intent clustering methods often fail to align with human perceptions due to a heavy reliance on embedding distance metrics and a tendency to overlook underlying semantic structures. This paper proposes an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) proposes context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. As existing English benchmarks offer limited semantic diversity and intent groups, we introduce a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset, comprising over 100k real customer service calls and 1,507 human-annotated intent clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable enhancements in clustering quality and lower computational cost. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the potential of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable and human-aligned intent clustering.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly deployed across diverse domains to tackle tasks requiring novel skills. However, current robot learning algorithms for acquiring novel skills often rely on demonstration datasets or environment interactions, resulting in high labor costs and potential safety risks. To address these challenges, this study proposes DemoGen, a skill-learning framework that enables robots to acquire novel skills from natural language instructions. DemoGen leverages the vision-language model and the video diffusion model to generate demonstration videos of novel skills, which enabling robots to learn new skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on novel tasks. These results highlight a novel approach to robot learning, offering a foundation for the intuitive and intelligent acquisition of novel robotic skills.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement (SE) usually uses conventional activation functions, which lack the expressiveness to capture complex multiscale structures needed for high-fidelity SE. Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), retains KAN's expressiveness while improving scalability on complex tasks. We adapt GR-KAN to existing DNN-based SE by replacing dense layers with GR-KAN layers in the time-frequency (T-F) domain MP-SENet and adapting GR-KAN's activations into the 1D CNN layers in the time-domain Demucs. Results on Voicebank-DEMAND show that GR-KAN requires up to 4x fewer parameters while improving PESQ by up to 0.1. In contrast, KAN, facing scalability issues, outperforms MLP on a small-scale signal modeling task but fails to improve MP-SENet. We demonstrate the first successful use of KAN-based methods for consistent improvement in both time- and SoTA TF-domain SE, establishing GR-KAN as a promising alternative for SE.

arXiv:2501.02298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) aim to sample from a target distribution by learning score functions using samples perturbed by Gaussian noise. Existing convergence bounds for SGMs in the $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance rely on stringent assumptions about the data distribution. In this work, we present a novel framework for analyzing $\mathcal{W}_2$-convergence in SGMs, significantly relaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity. Leveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a PDE-based analysis of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation governing the log-density of the forward process. Moreover, we establish that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the need for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit computations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and potential for broader classes of data distributions.

Abstract: Quadrotor control policies can be trained with high performance using the exact gradients of the rewards to directly optimize policy parameters via backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). However, designing a fully differentiable reward architecture is often challenging. Partially differentiable rewards will result in biased gradient propagation that degrades training performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose Amended Backpropagation-through-Time (ABPT), a novel approach that mitigates gradient bias while preserving the training efficiency of BPTT. ABPT combines 0-step and N-step returns, effectively reducing the bias by leveraging value gradients from the learned Q-value function. Additionally, it adopts entropy regularization and state initialization mechanisms to encourage exploration during training. We evaluate ABPT on four representative quadrotor flight tasks \li{in both real world and simulation}. Experimental results demonstrate that ABPT converges significantly faster and achieves higher ultimate rewards than existing learning algorithms, particularly in tasks involving partially differentiable rewards. The code will be released at http://github.com/Fanxing-LI/ABPT.

Abstract: Benchmarking and establishing proper statistical validation metrics for reinforcement learning (RL) remain ongoing challenges, where no consensus has been established yet. The emergence of quantum computing and its potential applications in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) further complicate benchmarking efforts. To enable valid performance comparisons and to streamline current research in this area, we propose a novel benchmarking methodology, which is based on a statistical estimator for sample complexity and a definition of statistical outperformance. Furthermore, considering QRL, our methodology casts doubt on some previous claims regarding its superiority. We conducted experiments on a novel benchmarking environment with flexible levels of complexity. While we still identify possible advantages, our findings are more nuanced overall. We discuss the potential limitations of these results and explore their implications for empirical research on quantum advantage in QRL.

Abstract: Knowledge editing is a promising way to improve factuality in large language models, but recent studies have shown significant model degradation during sequential editing. In this paper, we formalize the popular locate-then-edit methods as a two-step fine-tuning process, allowing us to precisely identify the root cause of this degradation. We show that model degradation occurs due to (1) over-optimization of internal activations and (2) continuous norm-growth of edited matrices. To mitigate these issues, we introduce two regularization techniques: (1) Most-Probable Early Stopping (MPES) and (2) explicit Frobenius norm-constraint. We demonstrate that applying these simple yet effective regularization techniques at key points in the editing process can substantially mitigate model degradation. Combining these regularization methods enables scaling locate-then-edit methods to 10,000 edits while reducing editing time by 42-61%. These results show that targeted regularization is essential for lifelong knowledge editing.

Abstract: As the demand for high-quality data in model training grows, researchers and developers are increasingly generating synthetic data to tune and train LLMs. However, current data generation methods rely on seed sets containing tens of thousands of examples to prompt instruction-tuned models. This reliance can be especially problematic when the curation of high-quality examples is expensive or difficult. In this paper we explore the novel few-shot synthetic data generation setting -- generating a high-quality dataset from a few examples. We show that when working with only a few seed examples, instruction-tuned models used in current synthetic data methods produce insufficient diversity for downstream tasks. In contrast, we show that base models without post-training, largely untapped for synthetic data generation, offer substantially greater output diversity, albeit with lower instruction following abilities. Leveraging this insight, we propose Base-Refine (BARE), a novel two-stage method that combines the diversity of base models with the quality assurance of instruction-tuned models. BARE excels in few-shot synthetic data generation: using only 3 seed examples it generates diverse, high-quality datasets that significantly improve downstream task performance. We show that fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with 1,000 BARE-generated samples achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art similarly sized models on LiveCodeBench tasks. Furthermore, data generated with BARE enables a 101% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B on GSM8K over data generated by only instruction-models, and an 18.4% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B over the state-of-the-art RAFT method for RAG data generation.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing by demonstrating exceptional performance across diverse tasks. This study investigates the impact of the parameter initialization scale on the training behavior and task preferences of LLMs. We discover that smaller initialization scales encourage models to favor reasoning tasks, whereas larger initialization scales lead to a preference for memorization tasks. We validate this reasoning bias via real datasets and meticulously designed anchor functions. Further analysis of initial training dynamics suggests that specific model components, particularly the embedding space and self-attention mechanisms, play pivotal roles in shaping these learning biases. We provide a theoretical framework from the perspective of model training dynamics to explain these phenomena. Additionally, experiments on real-world language tasks corroborate our theoretical insights. This work enhances our understanding of how initialization strategies influence LLM performance on reasoning tasks and offers valuable guidelines for training models.

Abstract: As platforms increasingly rely on learning algorithms, collectives may form and seek ways to influence these platforms to align with their own interests. This can be achieved by coordinated submission of altered data. To evaluate the potential impact of such behavior, it is essential to understand the computations that collectives must perform to impact platforms in this way. In particular, collectives need to make a priori assessments of the effect of the collective before taking action, as they may face potential risks when modifying their data. Moreover they need to develop implementable coordination algorithms based on quantities that can be inferred from observed data. We develop a framework that provides a theoretical and algorithmic treatment of these issues and present experimental results in a product evaluation domain.

<title>Convergence of TD(0) under Polynomial Mixing with Nonlinear Function Approximation</title>

Abstract: Temporal Difference Learning (TD(0)) is fundamental in reinforcement learning, yet its finite-sample behavior under non-i.i.d. data and nonlinear approximation remains unknown. We provide the first high-probability, finite-sample analysis of vanilla TD(0) on polynomially mixing Markov data, assuming only Holder continuity and bounded generalized gradients. This breaks with previous work, which often requires subsampling, projections, or instance-dependent step-sizes. Concretely, for mixing exponent $\beta > 1$, Holder continuity exponent $\gamma$, and step-size decay rate $\eta \in (1/2, 1]$, we show that, with high probability, \[ \| \theta_t - \theta^* \| \leq C(\beta, \gamma, \eta)\, t^{-\beta/2} + C'(\gamma, \eta)\, t^{-\eta\gamma} \] after $t = \mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. These bounds match the known i.i.d. rates and hold even when initialization is nonstationary. Central to our proof is a novel discrete-time coupling that bypasses geometric ergodicity, yielding the first such guarantee for nonlinear TD(0) under realistic mixing.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) has become critical for enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments by integrating both auditory and visual modalities. However, existing AVSR systems struggle to scale up without compromising computational efficiency. In this study, we introduce MoHAVE (Mixture of Hierarchical Audio-Visual Experts), a novel robust AVSR framework designed to address these scalability constraints. By leveraging a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MoHAVE activates modality-specific expert groups, ensuring dynamic adaptation to various audio-visual inputs with minimal computational overhead. Key contributions of MoHAVE include: (1) a sparse MoE framework that efficiently scales AVSR model capacity, (2) a hierarchical gating mechanism that dynamically utilizes the expert groups based on input context, enhancing adaptability and robustness, and (3) remarkable performance across robust AVSR benchmarks, including LRS3 and MuAViC transcription and translation tasks, setting a new standard for scalable speech recognition systems.

<title>Antimatter Annihilation Vertex Reconstruction with Deep Learning for ALPHA-g Radial Time Projection Chamber</title>

arXiv:2502.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ALPHA-g experiment at CERN aims to precisely measure the terrestrial gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen atoms. A radial Time Projection Chamber (rTPC), that surrounds the ALPHA-g magnetic trap, is employed to determine the annihilation location, called the vertex. The standard approach requires identifying the trajectories of the ionizing particles in the rTPC from the location of their interaction in the gas (spacepoints), and inferring the vertex positions by finding the point where those trajectories (helices) pass closest to one another. In this work, we present a novel approach to vertex reconstruction using an ensemble of models based on the PointNet deep learning architecture. The newly developed model, PointNet Ensemble for Annihilation Reconstruction (PEAR), directly learns the relation between the location of the vertices and the rTPC spacepoints, thus eliminating the need to identify and fit the particle tracks. PEAR shows strong performance in reconstructing vertical vertex positions from simulated data, that is superior to the standard approach for all metrics considered. Furthermore, the deep learning approach can reconstruct the vertical vertex position when the standard approach fails.

Abstract: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.

arXiv:2502.20727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.

<title>Investigating and Enhancing Vision-Audio Capability in Omnimodal Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2503.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Omnimodal Large Language Models (OLLMs) have shown significant progress in integrating vision and text, but still struggle with integrating vision and audio, often exhibiting suboptimal performance when processing audio queries compared to text queries. This disparity is primarily due to insufficient alignment between vision and audio modalities during training, leading to inadequate attention to visual information when using audio queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Self-Knowledge Distillation (Self-KD) training method where the vision-text component of the OLLM serves as the teacher and the vision-audio component as the student. This enables the model to process audio in a manner analogous to its text processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Self-KD is an effective method for enhancing the vision-audio capabilities of OLLMs by learning from the vision-text components, which subsequently improves the interaction between audio and images and results in improved performance on multimodal tasks.

arXiv:2503.01495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vovk (2015) introduced cross-conformal prediction, a modification of split conformal designed to improve the width of prediction sets. The method, when trained with a miscoverage rate equal to $\alpha$ and $n \gg K$, ensures a marginal coverage of at least $1 - 2\alpha - 2(1-\alpha)(K-1)/(n+K)$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $K$ denotes the number of folds. A simple modification of the method achieves coverage of at least $1-2\alpha$. In this work, we propose new variants of both methods that yield smaller prediction sets without compromising the latter theoretical guarantees. The proposed methods are based on recent results deriving more statistically efficient combination of p-values that leverage exchangeability and randomization. Simulations confirm the theoretical findings and bring out some important tradeoffs.

Abstract: Language model evaluations often fail to characterize consequential failure modes, forcing experts to inspect outputs and build new benchmarks. We introduce task elicitation, a method that automatically builds new evaluations to profile model behavior. Task elicitation finds hundreds of natural-language tasks -- an order of magnitude more than prior work -- where frontier models exhibit systematic failures, in domains ranging from forecasting to online harassment. For example, we find that Sonnet 3.5 over-associates quantum computing and AGI and that o3-mini is prone to hallucination when fabrications are repeated in-context.

arXiv:2503.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high cost of obtaining high-quality annotated data for in-context learning (ICL) has motivated the development of methods that use self-generated annotations in place of ground-truth labels. While these approaches have shown promising results in few-shot settings, they generally do not scale to many-shot scenarios. In this work, we study ICL with self-generated examples using a framework analogous to traditional semi-supervised learning, consisting of annotation generation, demonstration selection, and in-context inference. Within this framework, we propose a simple baseline that outperforms ground-truth ICL in zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot settings. Notably, we observe a scaling law with this baseline, where optimal performance is achieved with more than 1,000 demonstrations. To fully exploit the many-shot capabilities of semi-supervised ICL, we introduce IterPSD, an iterative annotation approach that integrates iterative refinement and curriculum pseudo-labeling techniques from semi-supervised learning, yielding up to 6.8% additional gains on classification tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step problem solving, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in intermediate outputs, leading to increased computational overhead. We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 15 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 78% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.

<title>Resource Heterogeneity-Aware and Utilization-Enhanced Scheduling for Deep Learning Clusters</title>

arXiv:2503.10918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scheduling deep learning (DL) models to train on powerful clusters with accelerators like GPUs and TPUs, presently falls short, either lacking fine-grained heterogeneity awareness or leaving resources substantially under-utilized. To fill this gap, we propose a novel design of a task-level heterogeneity-aware scheduler, Hadar, based on an optimization framework that can boost resource utilization. Hadar leverages the performance traits of DL jobs on a heterogeneous DL cluster, characterizes the task-level performance heterogeneity in the optimization problem, and makes scheduling decisions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. It involves the primal-dual framework employing a dual subroutine, to solve the optimization problem and guide the scheduling design. Our trace-driven simulation with representative DL model training workloads demonstrates that Hadar accelerates the total time duration by 1.20x when compared with its state-of-the-art heterogeneity-aware counterpart, Gavel. Further, our Hadar scheduler is enhanced to HadarE by forking each job into multiple copies to let a job train concurrently on heterogeneous GPUs resided on separate available nodes (i.e., machines or servers) for resource utilization enhancement. HadarE is evaluated extensively on physical DL clusters for comparison with Hadar and Gavel. With substantial enhancement in cluster resource utilization (by 1.45x), HadarE exhibits considerable speed-ups in DL model training, reducing the total time duration by 50% (or 80%) on an Amazon's AWS (or our lab) cluster, while producing trained DL models with consistently better inference quality than those trained by Hadar.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the amortized optimal transport filter (A-OTF) designed to mitigate the computational burden associated with the real-time training of optimal transport filters (OTFs). OTFs can perform accurate non-Gaussian Bayesian updates in the filtering procedure, but they require training at every time step, which makes them expensive. The proposed A-OTF framework exploits the similarity between OTF maps during an initial/offline training stage in order to reduce the cost of inference during online calculations. More precisely, we use clustering algorithms to select relevant subsets of pre-trained maps whose weighted average is used to compute the A-OTF model akin to a mixture of experts. A series of numerical experiments validate that A-OTF achieves substantial computational savings during online inference while preserving the inherent flexibility and accuracy of OTF.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is an effective, interpretable method for analyzing structure in data. It reveals insights at multiple scales without requiring a predefined number of clusters and captures nested patterns and subtle relationships, which are often missed by flat clustering approaches. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional data, especially when there are no clear density gaps between modes. In this work, we introduce t-NEB, a probabilistically grounded hierarchical clustering method, which yields state-of-the-art clustering performance on naturalistic high-dimensional data. t-NEB consists of three steps: (1) density estimation via overclustering; (2) finding maximum density paths between clusters; (3) creating a hierarchical structure via bottom-up cluster merging. t-NEB uses a probabilistic parametric density model for both overclustering and cluster merging, which yields both high clustering performance and a meaningful hierarchy, making it a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on intensive matrix multiplications for attention and feed-forward layers, with the Q, K, and V linear projections in the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) module constituting a decisive performance bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a highly optimized tiled matrix multiplication accelerator on a resource-constrained Xilinx KV260 FPGA that not only addresses this challenge but sets a new standard for efficiency and performance. Our design exploits persistent on-chip storage, a robust two-level tiling strategy for maximal data reuse, and a systolic-like unrolled compute engine that together deliver unparalleled speed and energy efficiency. Integrated with DistilBERT for Q, K, and V projections, our accelerator achieves an unequivocal 7x speedup over ARM CPU implementations (PyTorch) and an extraordinary 200x improvement over naive NumPy, reaching a throughput of up to 3.1~GFLOPs for matrix multiplications on (64,768) x (768,3072) matrices while operating at a conservative 100 MHz. These results decisively demonstrate the transformative potential of FPGA-based acceleration for critical Transformer operations, paving the way for scalable and energy-efficient deep learning inference on edge devices.

Abstract: The relationship between RNA structure and function has recently attracted interest within the deep learning community, a trend expected to intensify as nucleic acid structure models advance. Despite this momentum, a lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.

Abstract: Low-rank optimization problems with sparse simplex constraints involve variables that must satisfy nonnegativity, sparsity, and sum-to-one conditions, making their optimization particularly challenging due to the interplay between low-rank structures and constraints. These problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, environmental fields, and computational biology. In this paper, we propose a novel manifold optimization approach to tackle these problems efficiently. Our method leverages the geometry of oblique rotation manifolds to reformulate the problem and introduces a new Riemannian optimization method based on Riemannian gradient descent that strictly maintains the simplex constraints. By exploiting the underlying manifold structure, our approach improves optimization efficiency. Experiments on synthetic datasets compared to standard Euclidean and Riemannian methods show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances language models' performance but often leads to inefficient "overthinking" on simple problems. We identify that existing approaches directly penalizing reasoning length fail to account for varying problem complexity. Our approach constructs rewards through length and quality comparisons, guided by theoretical assumptions that jointly enhance solution correctness with conciseness. Moreover, we further demonstrate our method to fuzzy tasks where ground truth is unavailable. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy while generating significantly more concise explanations, effectively teaching models to "think when needed."

Abstract: Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

Abstract: Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health crisis, demanding new therapeutic strategies that target novel bacterial mechanisms. Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) for contextual bandit policies leverage historical data to evaluate and optimize a target policy. Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or imputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When this assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable extrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside the common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in settings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is required. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy evaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that leverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards into lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present contexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support assumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two assumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments demonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL, particularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support assumption increases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LC LLMs) combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained windows, and fragmented information from suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical RAG framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through real-time chunk- and document-level expansions. By initiating with finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating broader, higher-level context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines in single- and multi-step generation using Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.

Summary:<br />
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) but face accuracy and convergence challenges. The Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN) proposed in this paper integrates inter-balancing and intra-balancing to address these issues. Inter-balancing mitigates gradient imbalances between PDE residual and condition-fitting losses, while intra-balancing allocates weights based on fitting difficulty. A robust weight update strategy prevents abrupt spikes. Extensive experiments show that DB-PINN outperforms popular weighting methods in both convergence speed and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies. Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its fitting difficulty level. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy.

<div> complexity, diversity-aware clustering, approximation algorithm, parameterized approximation, NP-hardness

Summary:
This work investigates diversity-aware clustering problems where data points have multiple attributes and intersecting groups. The objective is to form clusters while adhering to lower and upper bound thresholds for each group and minimizing the clustering objective (e.g., $k$-median, $k$-means, $k$-supplier). The computational complexity of these problems is analyzed, revealing NP-hardness, polynomial-time inapproximability, and fixed-parameter intractability. The study presents parameterized approximation algorithms with approximation ratios approximately 1.736, 3.943, and 5 for diversity-aware $k$-median, diversity-aware $k$-means, and diversity-aware $k$-supplier, respectively. These approximation ratios are shown to be tight under Gap-ETH assumptions. The results also extend to fair variants of the problems with disjoint groups, such as fair $k$-median, fair $k$-means, and fair $k$-supplier, with lower bound requirements. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we study diversity-aware clustering problems where the data points are associated with multiple attributes resulting in intersecting groups. A clustering solution needs to ensure that the number of chosen cluster centers from each group should be within the range defined by a lower and upper bound threshold for each group, while simultaneously minimizing the clustering objective, which can be either $k$-median, $k$-means or $k$-supplier. We study the computational complexity of the proposed problems, offering insights into their NP-hardness, polynomial-time inapproximability, and fixed-parameter intractability. We present parameterized approximation algorithms with approximation ratios $1+ \frac{2}{e} + \epsilon \approx 1.736$, $1+\frac{8}{e} + \epsilon \approx 3.943$, and $5$ for diversity-aware $k$-median, diversity-aware $k$-means and diversity-aware $k$-supplier, respectively. Assuming Gap-ETH, the approximation ratios are tight for the diversity-aware $k$-median and diversity-aware $k$-means problems. Our results imply the same approximation factors for their respective fair variants with disjoint groups -- fair $k$-median, fair $k$-means, and fair $k$-supplier -- with lower bound requirements.

Summary:<br />
- The paper addresses the challenge of generating a polygon from a given visibility graph, focusing on structures without well-defined features and distance metrics.
- The VisDiff approach is proposed, which utilizes a diffusion-based method to estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon before extracting vertex locations.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the VisDiff approach to tackle the visibility reconstruction problem for polygons, emphasizing structures lacking well-defined features and distance metrics. By leveraging a diffusion-based method to estimate the signed distance function (SDF) before extracting vertex locations, VisDiff surpasses existing techniques with a 26% enhancement in F1-Score. The use of a meticulously curated dataset for training enables thorough benchmarking against standard and state-of-the-art methods. The innovative incorporation of the SDF in the generation process significantly enhances the capacity to capture visibility relationships in complex combinatorial structures. <div>
arXiv:2410.05530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to capture rich representations of combinatorial structures has enabled the application of machine learning to tasks such as analysis and generation of floorplans, terrains, images, and animations. Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$.
  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.

Summary:

The study explores the impact of distractors on latent action learning, particularly addressing challenges that arise when real-world videos contain action-correlated distractions. The research introduces LAOM, a modified version of LAPO that significantly enhances the quality of latent actions. By using the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) for empirical analysis, the study reveals that LAPO struggles in the presence of distractors, emphasizing the importance of supervision with ground-truth actions during training. Surprisingly, providing supervision with as little as 2.5% of the full dataset improves downstream performance by 4.2 times on average. These results challenge the traditional approach of solely focusing on learning Latent Action Models (LAM) before decoding from latent to ground-truth actions, highlighting the critical role of incorporating supervision in the training phase. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2502.00379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.

Summary: 
AI coding assistants used for tasks like code generation now gather automatic context from various sources, making them vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO). This attack manipulates coding assistants into generating incorrect outputs by subtly poisoning input with semantically equivalent adversarial code modifications. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to detect these manipulations, allowing attackers to shift blame to victim developers. A novel black-box attack algorithm, GCGS, systematically explores the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% success rate across multiple tasks and models. Defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against this attack, highlighting the need for new security measures in AI coding tools.

Abstract: AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-Loco, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors. Crucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across diverse robots and terrains.

arXiv:2505.10991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for attaining trust in the operation of AI systems. A key question of an AI system is ``why was this decision made this way''. Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI system to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be applicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more general explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated abductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input whose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same prediction. Inflated explanations cover a larger portion of the input space, and hence are deemed more general explanations. But there can be many (inflated) abductive explanations for an instance. Which is the best? In this paper, we show how to find a most general abductive explanation for an AI decision. This explanation covers as much of the input space as possible, while still being a correct formal explanation of the model's behaviour. Given that we only want to give a human one explanation for a decision, the most general explanation gives us the explanation with the broadest applicability, and hence the one most likely to seem sensible.

The study demonstrates that GLT enhances the versatility of BNNs by performing global tone mapping, leading to significant accuracy improvements on datasets like STL-10 and VWW. By combining GLT with block pruning, the researchers successfully develop lightweight, fully-binarized models under 1Mb in size that are suitable for in-sensor always-on inference applications. <div>

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping, enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb), fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable for in-sensor always-on inference use cases.

<div> Keywords: AI, neural operators, partial differential equations, multi-phase flows, computational fluid dynamics

Summary: 
This article discusses the use of neural operators in predicting the evolution of partial differential equations, particularly in complex problems like liquid-vapour multiphase flows. The traditional computational fluid dynamics models have limitations in forecasting abilities for fast industrial processes due to their inability to handle strong discontinuities in the computational domain. Neural operators show promise in bridging this gap by demonstrating a comparable time scale for predictions as required by multi-phase applications. These operators can be trained using various methods, including experimental data and simulations. In this study, neural operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, resulting in highly accurate predictions, especially in forecasting the liquid-vapour interface evolution crucial for multi-phase process control. This research paves the way for the application of neural operators in controlling processes that demand quick responses. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in AI has established neural operators as powerful tools that can predict the evolution of partial differential equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Some complex problems rely on sophisticated algorithms to deal with strong discontinuities in the computational domain. For example, liquid-vapour multiphase flows are a challenging problem in many configurations, particularly those involving large density gradients or phase change. The complexity mentioned above has not allowed for fine control of fast industrial processes or applications because computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models do not have a quick enough forecasting ability. This work demonstrates that the time scale of neural operators-based predictions is comparable to the time scale of multi-phase applications, thus proving they can be used to control processes that require fast response. Neural Operators can be trained using experimental data, simulations or a combination. In the following, neural operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, and the resulting predictions showed very high accuracy, particularly in predicting the evolution of the liquid-vapour interface, one of the most critical tasks in a multi-phase process controller.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel visualisation tool for understanding how deep learning models represent data by determining the axis alignment of embedded data at any layer. The tool evaluates the distribution around planes defined by the network's privileged basis vectors, providing a comprehensive metric for interpreting activation distribution. It shows that representations tend to align with the privileged basis vectors, which are influenced by activation functions.

Abstract: Understanding how deep learning models represent data is currently difficult due to the limited number of methodologies available. This paper demonstrates a versatile and novel visualisation tool for determining the axis alignment of embedded data at any layer in any deep learning model. In particular, it evaluates the distribution around planes defined by the network's privileged basis vectors. This method provides both an atomistic and a holistic, intuitive metric for interpreting the distribution of activations across all planes. It ensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the activation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations of this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to probe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are provided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with the privileged basis. This is not necessarily the standard basis, and it is found that activation functions directly result in privileged bases. Hence, it provides a direct causal link between functional form symmetry breaking and representational alignment, explaining why representations have a tendency to align with the neuron basis. Therefore, using this method, we begin to answer the fundamental question of what causes the observed tendency of representations to align with neurons. Finally, examples of so-called grandmother neurons are found in a variety of networks.

Abstract: We study Transformers through the perspective of optimal control theory, using tools from continuous-time formulations to derive actionable insights into training and architecture design. This framework improves the performance of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines, while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using 42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both the training and architecture of Transformers. It offers a new foundation for systematic, theory-driven improvements and moves beyond costly trial-and-error approaches.

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of long-time macroscopic dynamics and thermodynamics of dissipative systems with particle fidelity is hampered by significant obstacles. These include the strong time-scale limitations inherent to particle simulations, the non-uniqueness of the thermodynamic potentials and operators from given macroscopic dynamics, and the need for efficient uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces Statistical-Physics Informed Epistemic Diffusion Models (SPIEDiff), a machine learning framework designed to overcome these limitations in the context of purely dissipative systems by leveraging statistical physics, conditional diffusion models, and epinets. We evaluate the proposed framework on stochastic Arrhenius particle processes and demonstrate that SPIEDiff can accurately uncover both thermodynamics and kinetics, while enabling reliable long-time macroscopic predictions using only short-time particle simulation data. SPIEDiff can deliver accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty in minutes, drastically reducing the computational demand compared to direct particle simulations, which would take days or years in the examples considered. Overall, SPIEDiff offers a robust and trustworthy pathway for the data-driven discovery of thermodynamic models.

arXiv:2505.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) confronts the dual challenge of aligning known-class distributions across domains while identifying target-domain-specific unknown categories. Current approaches often fail to leverage semantic relationships between modalities and struggle with error accumulation in unknown sample detection. We propose to harness Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to address these limitations through two key innovations: 1) Prompt-driven cross-domain alignment: Learnable textual prompts conditioned on domain discrepancy metrics dynamically adapt CLIP's text encoder, enabling semantic consistency between source and target domains without explicit unknown-class supervision. 2) Gradient-aware open-set separation: A gradient analysis module quantifies domain shift by comparing the L2-norm of gradients from the learned prompts, where known/unknown samples exhibit statistically distinct gradient behaviors. Evaluations on Office-Home show that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard baseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, interpretability, physical sciences, equation discovery, mechanism

<br />
Summary:
Researchers have noted a disconnect between neural networks' success in predicting physical phenomena and their lack of transparent, integratable findings. Interpretability, often equated with sparsity, plays a crucial role in addressing this issue. However, existing definitions of interpretability from non-scientific fields may not fully apply to scientific machine learning (SciML). This work proposes an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences, emphasizing understanding the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. The focus on mechanisms highlights that sparsity is not always necessary for interpretability and raises questions about making interpretable scientific discoveries without prior knowledge. Developing a precise definition of interpretability in SciML can help researchers better address challenges in leveraging data-driven approaches for scientific advancement.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.

<div> transfer matrix, LoRASuite, fine-tuning, large language models, computational efficiency<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces LoRASuite, a modular approach designed to efficiently adapt existing LoRA weights to newer versions of Large Language Models (LLMs). By utilizing transfer matrices, centered kernel alignment, and cosine similarity metrics, LoRASuite allocates corresponding layers and attention heads, followed by skillful fine-tuning for numerical stability. Experimental results show that LoRASuite outperforms small-scale vanilla LoRA methods, surpassing even full-scale LoRA retraining on backbone LLMs like MiniCPM and Qwen, with notable improvements on math tasks. Furthermore, LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption and computational time, making it a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for adapting to evolving LLM updates. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated, LoRA weights trained on earlier versions quickly become obsolete. The conventional practice of retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly, time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: "How can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model versions?" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally, LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational time by 78.23%.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of zero-shot time series forecasting, an innovative approach leveraging pre-trained foundation models, to forecast mortality rates without task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate two state-of-the-art foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, alongside traditional and machine learning-based methods across three forecasting horizons (5, 10, and 20 years) using data from 50 countries and 111 age groups. In our investigations, zero-shot models showed varying results: while CHRONOS delivered competitive shorter-term forecasts, outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA and the Lee-Carter model, TimesFM consistently underperformed. Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term accuracy. A Random Forest model, trained on mortality data, achieved the best overall performance. These findings underscore the potential of zero-shot forecasting while highlighting the need for careful model selection and domain-specific adaptation.

<br />
Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA) is introduced as a method to reduce the Key-Value (KV) cache size in Transformer self-attention, particularly along the temporal dimension. By utilizing a hyper-network to merge adjacent KV cache vectors and implementing a stride-aware causal mask for efficient training, MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) while significantly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage. Experimental results across various tasks like speech translation, recognition, understanding, and text summarization show that MTLA offers notable speedup and memory reduction benefits without compromising translation quality. On a specific English-German speech translation task, MTLA demonstrates a 5.3x increase in speed and an impressive 8.3x reduction in GPU memory usage compared to MHA. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value (KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation, speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage. For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA, while maintaining translation quality.

Summary:<br />
FedPrLLM is a federated pruning framework designed for compressing large language models (LLMs) in privacy-sensitive domains. It allows for collaborative pruning of the global model using local calibration data from each client, ensuring privacy while achieving compression. Extensive experiments within the FedPrLLM framework show that one-shot pruning with layer comparison and no weight scaling is the most effective approach. The framework aims to guide future efforts in pruning LLMs for privacy-sensitive applications. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2505.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs, enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue, we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework, including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/FedPrLLM.

<div> fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, delta compression, UltraDelta, high compression, strong performance <br />
Summary: <br />
UltraDelta is introduced as a data-free delta compression method that achieves ultra-high compression and strong performance by optimizing various dimensions. The method includes Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation to allocate sparsity based on variance to maintain inter-layer information, Distribution-Aware Compression for better preservation of intra-layer distribution through group-wise pruning, and Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling to enhance model stability under higher compression. The approach is tested across various large language models, general NLP models, vision models, and multi-modal models, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression ratios. <div>
arXiv:2505.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on decision-focused learning (DFL) in dynamic environments, where the objective function and data distribution change over time. The challenges in such scenarios include zero or undefined gradients in the objective function and non-convexity. To overcome these challenges, the researchers regularize the objective function to make it differentiable and apply the optimism principle with an appropriate perturbation based on a near-optimal oracle. This results in the development of a practical online algorithm with established bounds on the expected dynamic regret. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through comparison with a classic prediction-focused approach in a knapsack experiment. The findings showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach in tackling evolving decision-making tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks. Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. This end-to-end strategy holds promise for tackling complex combinatorial problems; however, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging because the objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it differentiable and (ii) make use of the optimism principle, based on a near-optimal oracle along with an appropriate perturbation. This leads to a practical online algorithm for which we establish bounds on the expected dynamic regret, both when the decision space is a simplex and when it is a general bounded convex polytope. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing its performance with a classic prediction-focused approach on a simple knapsack experiment.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically, we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives: short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task, highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible setting.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems -- governed by partial differential equations -- present unique challenges regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels. As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. Our results demonstrate significant gains both in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better scaling to more complex dynamics, that is, larger Rayleigh numbers.

Summary:<br />
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision applications, but face challenges when deployed on embedded platforms like FPGAs. This study presents best practices for running a TinyYOLOv3 detector network on a XILINX Artix-7 FPGA. Techniques such as fusion of batch normalization, filter pruning, and post-training network quantization are utilized to optimize performance. FPGAs require strategies to address high computational intensity, memory requirements, and arithmetic constraints when running CNNs. By implementing these methods, the deployment of CNNs on FPGAs can be significantly improved for tasks such as object detection in images or video streams. <div>

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained high popularity as a tool for computer vision tasks and for that reason are used in various applications. There are many different concepts, like single shot detectors, that have been published for detecting objects in images or video streams. However, CNNs suffer from disadvantages regarding the deployment on embedded platforms such as re-configurable hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Due to the high computational intensity, memory requirements and arithmetic conditions, a variety of strategies for running CNNs on FPGAs have been developed. The following methods showcase our best practice approaches for a TinyYOLOv3 detector network on a XILINX Artix-7 FPGA using techniques like fusion of batch normalization, filter pruning and post training network quantization.

<div> Keywords: Federated Learning, Human Activity Recognition, Catastrophic forgetting, FlexFed, Dynamic distributions 
Summary: 
FlexFed is a novel Federated Learning (FL) approach designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in resource-constrained Human Activity Recognition (HAR) environments. The proposed approach prioritizes data retention for efficient memory use and adjusts offline training frequency based on distribution shifts and client capabilities. A new metric is introduced to quantify CF in FL, considering under-represented data for more accurate evaluations. An evaluation framework simulating streaming data, dynamic distributions, and varying availability shows that FlexFed effectively mitigates CF, improving FL efficiency by 10 to 15% and achieving faster convergence. This approach is particularly beneficial for infrequent or under-represented data, enhancing stability and performance in HAR environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving privacy by allowing clients to share model updates instead of raw data. Pervasive computing environments (e.g., for Human Activity Recognition, HAR), which we focus on in this paper, are characterized by resource-constrained end devices, streaming sensor data and intermittent client participation. Variations in user behavior, common in HAR environments, often result in non-stationary data distributions. As such, existing FL approaches face challenges in HAR settings due to differing assumptions. The combined effects of HAR characteristics, namely heterogeneous data and intermittent participation, can lead to a severe issue called catastrophic forgetting (CF). Unlike Continuous Learning (CL), which addresses CF using memory and replay mechanisms, FL's privacy constraints prohibit such strategies.
  To tackle CF in HAR environments, we propose FlexFed, a novel FL approach that prioritizes data retention for efficient memory use and dynamically adjusts offline training frequency based on distribution shifts, client capability and offline duration. To better quantify CF in FL, we introduce a new metric that accounts for under-represented data, enabling more accurate evaluations. We also develop a realistic HAR-based evaluation framework that simulates streaming data, dynamic distributions, imbalances and varying availability. Experiments show that FlexFed mitigates CF more effectively, improves FL efficiency by 10 to 15 % and achieves faster, more stable convergence, especially for infrequent or under-represented data.

<div> optimization, symmetry, cost functional, black-box, variational method

Summary:
This study focuses on reducing task cost functionals that are defined over Sobolev-class signals and invariant under a global symmetry group. The cost metrics are non-differentiable and internally generated, common in machine learning and imaging. A variational method is proposed to create explicit deformations of input signals by using a gauge field to induce symmetry-breaking deformations. These deformations are shown to decrease the cost along a direction transverse to the symmetry orbit of the signal. The approach does not require access to model gradients or labels and operates at test time. By utilizing Lie-algebraic variational flows, this method offers a way to optimize invariant cost functionals in scenarios where symmetries are present, such as black-box models and symmetry-constrained tasks. The exceptional degeneracies are of negligible Gaussian measure, making the approach effective and principled in cost reduction while maintaining symmetry constraints. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of reducing a task cost functional $W(S)$, defined over Sobolev-class signals $S$, when the cost is invariant under a global symmetry group $G \subset \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ and accessible only as a black-box. Such scenarios arise in machine learning, imaging, and inverse problems, where cost metrics reflect model outputs or performance scores but are non-differentiable and model-internal. We propose a variational method that exploits the symmetry structure to construct explicit, symmetry-breaking deformations of the input signal. A gauge field $\phi$, obtained by minimizing an auxiliary energy functional, induces a deformation $h = A_\phi[S]$ that generically lies transverse to the $G$-orbit of $S$. We prove that, under mild regularity, the cost $W$ strictly decreases along this direction -- either via Clarke subdifferential descent or by escaping locally flat plateaus. The exceptional set of degeneracies has zero Gaussian measure. Our approach requires no access to model gradients or labels and operates entirely at test time. It provides a principled tool for optimizing invariant cost functionals via Lie-algebraic variational flows, with applications to black-box models and symmetry-constrained tasks.

<div> Transformer, Generative Pre-trained Transformer, sequential decision making, operations research, management science

Summary: 
The article introduces a new model called OMGPT, which is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer designed specifically for solving sequential decision making tasks in operations research and management science. The model is built from scratch and offers a general sequence modeling framework that covers various operational decision making tasks such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, resource allocation, and queueing control. Unlike existing methods, OMGPT leverages pre-trained data and does not rely on any analytical model structure, providing a direct mapping from historical information to future actions. The Bayesian perspective is used to understand the model's performance, which is linked to the diversity of pre-training tasks and the discrepancy between testing and pre-training tasks. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OMGPT across all considered tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch to solve sequential decision making tasks arising in contexts of operations research and management science which we call OMGPT. We first propose a general sequence modeling framework to cover several operational decision making tasks as special cases, such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, resource allocation, and queueing control. Under the framework, all these tasks can be viewed as a sequential prediction problem where the goal is to predict the optimal future action given all the historical information. Then we train a transformer-based neural network model (OMGPT) as a natural and powerful architecture for sequential modeling. This marks a paradigm shift compared to the existing methods for these OR/OM tasks in that (i) the OMGPT model can take advantage of the huge amount of pre-trained data; (ii) when tackling these problems, OMGPT does not assume any analytical model structure and enables a direct and rich mapping from the history to the future actions. Either of these two aspects, to the best of our knowledge, is not achieved by any existing method. We establish a Bayesian perspective to theoretically understand the working mechanism of the OMGPT on these tasks, which relates its performance with the pre-training task diversity and the divergence between the testing task and pre-training tasks. Numerically, we observe a surprising performance of the proposed model across all the above tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the sample dependence of critical points for neural networks. We introduce a sample-independent critical lifting operator that associates a parameter of one network with a set of parameters of another, thus defining sample-dependent and sample-independent lifted critical points. We then show by example that previously studied critical embeddings do not capture all sample-independent lifted critical points. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of sample-dependent lifted critical points for sufficiently large sample sizes and prove that saddles appear among them.

Summary: <br />
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is automated architecture design, with One-Shot NAS like DARTS popular for their efficiency and simplicity. However, high GPU memory requirements during search are a challenge. To address this, the study introduces a method to automatically prune the search space, reducing memory usage and search time while maintaining accuracy. Zero-Shot NAS is utilized to eliminate low-performing designs before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned space. The experimental results on the DARTS search space demonstrate an 81% reduction in memory consumption compared to the baseline One-Shot setup without sacrificing accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating architecture design. One-Shot NAS techniques, such as DARTS, have gained substantial popularity due to their combination of search efficiency with simplicity of implementation. By design, One-Shot methods have high GPU memory requirements during the search. To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space. Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while achieving the same level of accuracy.

Summary:
The article discusses the analysis of the unique metric tensor on the high dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks, termed as the neuromanifold, using the Fisher information. By focusing on a low-dimensional space of probability distributions called the core space, the spectrum of its Riemannian metric is carefully examined, leading to deterministic bounds on the metric tensor for classification networks. An unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor and its bounds is introduced based on Hutchinson's trace estimator, allowing for efficient evaluation through a single backward pass. This estimate can be used to estimate the diagonal, block diagonal, or full tensor with guaranteed quality and bounded standard deviation. The methodology proposed in this study provides a reliable approach for estimating and analyzing the metric tensor in deep learning networks.

Abstract: The high dimensional parameter space of modern deep neural networks -- the neuromanifold -- is endowed with a unique metric tensor defined by the Fisher information, estimating which is crucial for both theory and practical methods in deep learning. To analyze this tensor for classification networks, we return to a low dimensional space of probability distributions -- the core space -- and carefully analyze the spectrum of its Riemannian metric. We extend our discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the neuromanifold. We introduce an unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor and its bounds based on Hutchinson's trace estimator. It can be evaluated efficiently through a single backward pass and can be used to estimate the diagonal, or block diagonal, or the full tensor. Its quality is guaranteed with a standard deviation bounded by the true value up to scaling.

<div> Adaptive Constrained Equivariance, neural networks, symmetries, optimization approach, data-driven equilibrium
<br />
Summary:
<br />
Equivariant neural networks aim to leverage symmetries in data distributions for improved generalization and sample efficiency. However, real-world data often deviates from perfect symmetry due to various factors like noise and measurement biases. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit such asymmetric data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to handle partial symmetries. The Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE) approach introduced in this paper starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance during optimization. This method smooths training, leading to improved performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared to strictly equivariant models. ACE strikes a balance between equivariance and non-equivariance, providing a more effective way to handle data with varying degrees of symmetry. <div>
arXiv:2505.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however, often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation, measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact in a peer evaluation setting, where rewards are computed using a determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on tasks with short time frames, but struggle with tasks requiring longer durations. While datasets covering extended-duration tasks, such as software engineering tasks or video games, do exist, there are currently few implementations of complex board games specifically designed for reinforcement learning and LLM evaluation. To address this gap, we propose the 4Hammer reinforcement learning environment, a digital twin simulation of a subset of Warhammer 40,000-a complex, zero-sum board game. Warhammer 40,000 features intricate rules, requiring human players to thoroughly read and understand over 50 pages of detailed natural language rules, grasp the interactions between their game pieces and those of their opponents, and independently track and communicate the evolving game state.

Summary:<br />
Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA) is proposed as a framework for privacy-preserving and computationally efficient adaptation in Federated Learning (FL). Unlike existing methods, FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by utilizing similarity-aware aggregation based on model output distributions over noise samples. This ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while maintaining data privacy. The framework minimizes entropy at each client for continual adaptation, enhancing model confidence in evolving target distributions. FedCTTA does not require server-side training during adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, enabling scalability as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FedCTTA over existing methods in various scenarios of temporal and spatial heterogeneity.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL models often suffer performance degradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to adapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face challenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing, and scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated adaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics, FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware aggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise samples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data privacy. Furthermore, FedCTTA minimizes the entropy at each client for continual adaptation, enhancing the model's confidence in evolving target distributions. Our method eliminates the need for server-side training during adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, making it scalable even as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments show that FedCTTA surpasses existing methods across diverse temporal and spatial heterogeneity scenarios.

By propagating a sum up the computational graph, the complexity is hidden from users, making it suitable for machine learning compilers.

Abstract: Computing partial differential equation (PDE) operators via nested backpropagation is expensive, yet popular, and severely restricts their utility for scientific machine learning. Recent advances, like the forward Laplacian and randomizing Taylor mode automatic differentiation (AD), propose forward schemes to address this. We introduce an optimization technique for Taylor mode that 'collapses' derivatives by rewriting the computational graph, and demonstrate how to apply it to general linear PDE operators, and randomized Taylor mode. The modifications simply require propagating a sum up the computational graph, which could -- or should -- be done by a machine learning compiler, without exposing complexity to users. We implement our collapsing procedure and evaluate it on popular PDE operators, confirming it accelerates Taylor mode and outperforms nested backpropagation.

Abstract: Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.

Summary: The article critiques reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs) by examining the assumptions and formulation. The structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) are highlighted, leading to a degenerate MDP that doesn't require reinforcement learning. The simplifying assumptions effectively equate the approach to outcome-driven supervised learning. Experiments on benchmarks show that iterative supervised fine-tuning achieves comparable performance to reinforcement learning-based training. The structural assumptions incentivize the RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens, questioning the narrative of "RL generating longer thinking traces." While reinforcement learning may have its uses in improving LLM reasoning abilities, the simplistic assumptions in modeling the MDP raise doubts about the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Abstract: This study focus in the construction of an unsupervised anomaly detection methodology to detect faulty images in MUED. We believe that unsupervised techniques are the best choice for our purposes because the data used to train the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must, additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.

<div> offline reinforcement learning, model-based RL, world model, policy learning, robustness

Summary:<br />
The article presents a novel framework for offline model-based RL that aims to improve data efficiency and generalization. Unlike existing methods, this framework dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy to enhance robustness and prevent performance degradation from small adversarial noise. The proposed method combines Stackelberg learning dynamics to solve a maximin optimization problem, optimizing both the world model and policy simultaneously. The theoretical analysis supports the design, and computationally efficient implementations are introduced. Benchmarking on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks showcases the algorithm's state-of-the-art performance. By addressing the objective mismatch in existing offline MBRL methods and focusing on improving robustness, the proposed framework offers a promising approach for data-driven control in RL applications. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces an approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm (ADASAP) for improving the scalability of Gaussian process (GP) inference in handling large datasets. By leveraging determinantal point processes theory, ADASAP shows rapid convergence of the posterior mean to the true posterior mean, providing an efficient and condition number-free method for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral basis functions. Comparative analysis demonstrates ADASAP's superior performance over existing solvers such as conjugate gradient and coordinate descent across various benchmark datasets and a large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Remarkably, ADASAP showcases scalability to datasets exceeding 3e8 samples, a significant achievement not previously reported in the literature. ADASAP emerges as a principled and efficient approach for GP inference, offering significant advancements in scalability and performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications), since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm ($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference. $\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a dataset with $> 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished in the literature.

<div> scaling laws, hyperparameters, model size, dataset size, batch size

Summary:<br /><br />Efficient Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training necessitates well-optimized hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate and weight decay. The study explores scaling laws for hyperparameters by examining their relationship with model size, dataset size, and batch size. The AdamW timescale remains consistent across training settings, with optimal weight decay scaling linearly with batch size for fixed model and dataset sizes. Furthermore, the optimal timescale follows a precise power law determined by the tokens-per-parameter ratio as model and dataset sizes increase. The study also investigates scaling laws for optimal batch size for minimizing loss and critical batch size signaling the point beyond which additional data parallelism loses effectiveness. Both optimal and critical batch sizes scale as power laws in dataset size, regardless of model size. These findings offer insights for selecting optimal model and dataset sizes based on dual training time and compute objectives.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs), including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training. We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N. Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel resampling criterion using lift scores to enhance compositional generation in diffusion models. By assessing whether generated samples align with each individual condition and then combining the results to determine overall satisfaction with the composed prompt, the authors aim to improve the quality of generated outputs. They demonstrate that lift scores can be effectively approximated using only the original diffusion model, without requiring external training or modules. An optimized variant is proposed to reduce computational overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various datasets, including 2D synthetic data, CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis, show that lift scores lead to significant improvements in condition alignment for compositional generation. The code for the proposed method is available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <br /> <div>

By leveraging the lift scores, we evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules. We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness.

<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to generating synthetic data streams that incorporate both concept drifts and the emergence of new, previously unknown classes. Traditionally, methods focus on either detecting concept drifts or identifying novel classes, but this study addresses both challenges simultaneously. By utilizing unsupervised drift detectors, the strategy presented in this research is able to effectively detect novelty and concept drifts in data streams. The generated data streams can also be leveraged for open set recognition tasks, where the goal is to classify known classes accurately while recognizing objects outside the model's expertise. This comprehensive approach to data stream generation provides a valuable framework for tackling the complexities of non-stationary data environments.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of data non-stationarity is commonly addressed in data stream processing. In a dynamic environment, methods should continuously be ready to analyze time-varying data -- hence, they should enable incremental training and respond to concept drifts. An equally important variability typical for non-stationary data stream environments is the emergence of new, previously unknown classes. Often, methods focus on one of these two phenomena -- detection of concept drifts or detection of novel classes -- while both difficulties can be observed in data streams. Additionally, concerning previously unknown observations, the topic of open set of classes has become particularly important in recent years, where the goal of methods is to efficiently classify within known classes and recognize objects outside the model competence. This article presents a strategy for synthetic data stream generation in which both concept drifts and the emergence of new classes representing unknown objects occur. The presented research shows how unsupervised drift detectors address the task of detecting novelty and concept drifts and demonstrates how the generated data streams can be utilized in the open set recognition task.

Abstract: We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art MaxIS methods for static graphs, including a mixed integer programming solver, deterministic rule-based algorithms, and a heuristic learning framework based on dynamic programming and GNNs. Across synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs of 100-10,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic learning framework in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. Our model generalizes well on graphs 100x larger than the ones used for training, achieving performance at par with both a greedy technique and a commercial mixed integer programming solver while running 1.5-23x faster than greedy.

arXiv:2505.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.

Summary: 
This article explores the equivalence between indirect elicitation (IE) and calibration for convex differentiable losses in the context of discrete prediction tasks. The study first establishes that for one-dimensional losses in this class, IE and calibration are equivalent under mild conditions. However, a counter-example reveals that this equivalence does not hold in higher dimensions. To address this, the concept of strong IE is introduced as a stronger condition that still offers ease of verification. The study shows that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable surrogates and is necessary and sufficient for strongly convex, differentiable surrogates. The findings highlight the importance of IE and strong IE in the design and analysis of consistent differentiable surrogates for a variety of problems. <div>
arXiv:2505.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical consistency of surrogate losses for discrete prediction tasks is often checked via the condition of calibration. However, directly verifying calibration can be arduous. Recent work shows that for polyhedral surrogates, a less arduous condition, indirect elicitation (IE), is still equivalent to calibration. We give the first results of this type for non-polyhedral surrogates, specifically the class of convex differentiable losses. We first prove that under mild conditions, IE and calibration are equivalent for one-dimensional losses in this class. We construct a counter-example that shows that this equivalence fails in higher dimensions. This motivates the introduction of strong IE, a strengthened form of IE that is equally easy to verify. We establish that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable surrogates and is both necessary and sufficient for strongly convex, differentiable surrogates. Finally, we apply these results to a range of problems to demonstrate the power of IE and strong IE for designing and analyzing consistent differentiable surrogates.

The article introduces Windowed Inference for Non-blank Detection (WIND) as a method to accelerate RNN-T inference without compromising accuracy. WIND processes multiple frames simultaneously within a window, speeding up the model's ability to identify non-blank predictions during decoding.

Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate up to 2.4X speed improvement compared to sequential processing while maintaining the same Word Error Rate (WER) performance. The beam-search algorithm shows slightly better accuracy than alternative methods, with significantly improved speed. The authors plan to release the open-source WIND implementation for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: We propose Windowed Inference for Non-blank Detection (WIND), a novel strategy that significantly accelerates RNN-T inference without compromising model accuracy. During model inference, instead of processing frames sequentially, WIND processes multiple frames simultaneously within a window in parallel, allowing the model to quickly locate non-blank predictions during decoding, resulting in significant speed-ups. We implement WIND for greedy decoding, batched greedy decoding with label-looping techniques, and also propose a novel beam-search decoding method. Experiments on multiple datasets with different conditions show that our method, when operating in greedy modes, speeds up as much as 2.4X compared to the baseline sequential approach while maintaining identical Word Error Rate (WER) performance. Our beam-search algorithm achieves slightly better accuracy than alternative methods, with significantly improved speed. We will open-source our WIND implementation.

This paper introduces a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning (RL) that combines offline datasets and online interactions to improve policy learning. By augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with offline data, the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of sub-optimality gap and regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is characterized by a sub-optimality gap of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$ and a regret speed-up of $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ compared to pure online learning. The study highlights the importance of the offline dataset's coverage properties for different learning metrics. Experimental validation on various RL models, including linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes, confirms the theoretical findings' effectiveness.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e., sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).

Summary:<br />
This paper investigates the impact of intermediate tokens, or "Chains of Thought," on the performance of transformer models trained on reasoning tasks. By training models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and solutions, the study examines the influence of correct intermediate steps on final solution accuracy. Surprisingly, even when trained on entirely correct traces, models still produce invalid reasoning traces while arriving at correct solutions. Furthermore, training models on noisy, corrupted traces shows that trace accuracy does not strongly correlate with solution accuracy. This challenges the assumption that Chains of Thought induce predictable reasoning behaviors and highlights the importance of not over-interpreting such outputs as evidence of human-like behaviors in language models. <div>
arXiv:2505.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), and especially of the process of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs in order to help find new reasoning patterns. In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized as "thoughts" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance. We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or "Chains of Thought" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, deceptive behavior, lie detector, training pipeline, policy learning

Summary: 
The study investigates the use of lie detectors in training AI systems to detect deceptive behavior. It explores concerns about contamination and objective hacking when incorporating lie detectors in the training pipeline for large language models. Using a dataset of truthful and deceptive responses, the researchers identify key factors affecting the honesty of learned policies, including exploration during preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and regularization strength. The results show that training with lie detectors can lead to policies that evade detection, with high deception rates, but higher lie detector true positive rates or regularization strength can promote honesty in the learned policies. Off-policy algorithms consistently result in lower deception rates. The findings suggest that the use of lie detectors in training can be effective for oversight but may also pose risks of undetectable misalignment in certain contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine evaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie detectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not typically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination and objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether the learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie detector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors that determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We find that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies which evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\%. However, if the lie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently high, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO) consistently lead to deception rates under 25\% for realistic TPRs. Our results illustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the context, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable oversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D molecules.

<div> Keywords: language model, fine-tuning, catastrophic forgetting, KL divergence, context-free generation

Summary:
Context-free generation is proposed as a method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning language models without access to training data. By penalizing the KL divergence between the original model and the fine-tuned model, the method helps preserve zero-shot performance and reasoning abilities. The study demonstrates that context-free generations are more effective in preventing forgetting than contextual synthetic data or a portion of pretraining data. Factors such as generation temperature and data ratios are investigated for their impact on model performance. Results on OLMo-1B and R1-Distill-Llama-8B models show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining and improving model performance during fine-tuning.<br /><br />Summary: Context-free generation is a successful approach for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning language models, preserving zero-shot performance and reasoning abilities. The method outperforms using contextual synthetic data or a portion of pretraining data, and the study investigates the impact of various factors on model performance. Results on different models demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning a language model often results in a degradation of its existing performance on other tasks, due to a shift in the model parameters; this phenomenon is often referred to as (catastrophic) forgetting. We are interested in mitigating this, in settings where we only have access to the model weights but no access to its training data/recipe. A natural approach is to penalize the KL divergence between the original model and the new one. Our main realization is that a simple process - which we term context-free generation - allows for an approximate unbiased estimation of this KL divergence. We show that augmenting a fine-tuning dataset with context-free generations mitigates forgetting, in two settings: (a) preserving the zero-shot performance of pretrained-only models, and (b) preserving the reasoning performance of thinking models. We show that contextual synthetic data, and even a portion of the pretraining data, are less effective. We also investigate the effect of choices like generation temperature, data ratios etc. We present our results for OLMo-1B for pretrained-only setting and R1-Distill-Llama-8B for the reasoning setting.

Summary: <br />
The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) are alternative models to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), offering increased expressiveness and interpretability. The KAT, leveraging Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), aims to match FLOPs with traditional Transformers but suffers from significant training slowdown due to memory stalls in the backward pass. A new approach, FlashKAT, addresses this issue by minimizing gradient accumulation through atomic adds and accessing slow memory efficiently. Evaluations show an 86.5x training speedup compared to KAT, reducing rounding errors in coefficient gradients. FlashKAT's implementation is available on GitHub, providing a promising solution to the performance bottlenecks in Kolmogorov-Arnold models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds, indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT, which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient gradients.

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through memorization and membership inference attacks. This paper introduces a more general threat model where adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information, making fine-tuned LLMs susceptible to fragment-specific extraction attacks. Two data-blind methods, a likelihood ratio attack and PRISM, are proposed to systematically investigate these attacks. These methods show competitive performance with a data-aware baseline classifier, highlighting their robustness. Examples from medical and legal domains demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks in extracting sensitive information from fine-tuned LLMs. This research sheds light on the vulnerabilities of LLMs in protecting sensitive data and emphasizes the need for robust defenses against information leakage through model queries. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example, if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has "osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM, which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into {[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable agents.

Abstract: Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets, resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models' prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights into their effective utilization.

Abstract: In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network.
  To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.

<title>Enforcing Hard Linear Constraints in Deep Learning Models with Decision Rules</title>

arXiv:2505.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical tasks where predictions must satisfy hard constraints, such as physical laws, fairness requirements, or safety limits. However, standard architectures lack built-in mechanisms to enforce such constraints, and existing approaches based on regularization or projection are often limited to simple constraints, computationally expensive, or lack feasibility guarantees. This paper proposes a model-agnostic framework for enforcing input-dependent linear equality and inequality constraints on neural network outputs. The architecture combines a task network trained for prediction accuracy with a safe network trained using decision rules from the stochastic and robust optimization literature to ensure feasibility across the entire input space. The final prediction is a convex combination of the two subnetworks, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during both training and inference without iterative procedures or runtime optimization. We prove that the architecture is a universal approximator of constrained functions and derive computationally tractable formulations based on linear decision rules. Empirical results on benchmark regression tasks show that our method consistently satisfies constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy and low inference latency.

<title>Utilizing Strategic Pre-training to Reduce Overfitting: Baguan -- A Pre-trained Weather Forecasting Model</title>

Abstract: Weather forecasting has long posed a significant challenge for humanity. While recent AI-based models have surpassed traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods in global forecasting tasks, overfitting remains a critical issue due to the limited availability of real-world weather data spanning only a few decades. Unlike fields like computer vision or natural language processing, where data abundance can mitigate overfitting, weather forecasting demands innovative strategies to address this challenge with existing data. In this paper, we explore pre-training methods for weather forecasting, finding that selecting an appropriately challenging pre-training task introduces locality bias, effectively mitigating overfitting and enhancing performance. We introduce Baguan, a novel data-driven model for medium-range weather forecasting, built on a Siamese Autoencoder pre-trained in a self-supervised manner and fine-tuned for different lead times. Experimental results show that Baguan outperforms traditional methods, delivering more accurate forecasts. Additionally, the pre-trained Baguan demonstrates robust overfitting control and excels in downstream tasks, such as subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) modeling and regional forecasting, after fine-tuning.

<title>InfiFPO: Implicit Model Fusion via Preference Optimization in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs from source models while discarding their probability information. To address this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The past decades witness the significant advancements in time series forecasting (TSF) across various real-world domains, including e-commerce and disease spread prediction. However, TSF is usually constrained by the uncertainty dilemma of predicting future data with limited past observations. To settle this question, we explore the use of Cross-Future Behavior (CFB) in TSF, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. We leverage CFB features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on real-world dataset. Experiments on both offline large-scale dataset and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAFT. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/CRAFTinTSF/CRAFT.

<title>Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Numerous works have noted significant similarities in how machine learning models represent the world, even across modalities. Although much effort has been devoted to uncovering properties and metrics on which these models align, surprisingly little work has explored causes of this similarity. To advance this line of inquiry, this work explores how two possible causal factors -- dataset overlap and task overlap -- influence downstream model similarity. The exploration of dataset overlap is motivated by the reality that large-scale generative AI models are often trained on overlapping datasets of scraped internet data, while the exploration of task overlap seeks to substantiate claims from a recent work, the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, that task similarity may drive model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors through a broad set of experiments. We find that both positively correlate with higher representational similarity and that combining them provides the strongest effect. Our code and dataset are published.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks learn remains a fundamental challenge in modern machine learning. A growing body of evidence suggests that training dynamics undergo a distinct phase transition, yet our understanding of this transition is still incomplete. In this paper, we introduce an interval-wise perspective that compares network states across a time window, revealing two new phenomena that illuminate the two-phase nature of deep learning. i) \textbf{The Chaos Effect.} By injecting an imperceptibly small parameter perturbation at various stages, we show that the response of the network to the perturbation exhibits a transition from chaotic to stable, suggesting there is an early critical period where the network is highly sensitive to initial conditions; ii) \textbf{The Cone Effect.} Tracking the evolution of the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK), we find that after this transition point the model's functional trajectory is confined to a narrow cone-shaped subset: while the kernel continues to change, it gets trapped into a tight angular region. Together, these effects provide a structural, dynamical view of how deep networks transition from sensitive exploration to stable refinement during training.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches, L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes.

Abstract: Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example, an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Abstract: World models predict state transitions in response to actions and are increasingly developed across diverse modalities. However, standard training objectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with task-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like accuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models across domains, including text games, web navigation, and robot manipulation. Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models, RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of generative models more broadly.

Abstract: We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).

<title>VAMO: Efficient Large-Scale Nonconvex Optimization via Adaptive Zeroth Order Variance Reduction</title>

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale nonconvex problems, common in machine learning, demands balancing rapid convergence with computational efficiency. First-order (FO) stochastic methods like SVRG provide fast convergence and good generalization but incur high costs due to full-batch gradients in large models. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms reduce this burden using estimated gradients, yet their slow convergence in high-dimensional settings limits practicality. We introduce VAMO (VAriance-reduced Mixed-gradient Optimizer), a stochastic variance-reduced method combining FO mini-batch gradients with lightweight ZO finite-difference probes under an SVRG-style framework. VAMO's hybrid design uses a two-point ZO estimator to achieve a dimension-agnostic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T + 1/b)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $b$ is the batch-size, surpassing the dimension-dependent slowdown of purely ZO methods and significantly improving over SGD's $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate. Additionally, we propose a multi-point ZO variant that mitigates the $O(1/b)$ error by adjusting number of estimation points to balance convergence and cost, making it ideal for a whole range of computationally constrained scenarios. Experiments including traditional neural network training and LLM finetuning show VAMO outperforms established FO and ZO methods, offering a faster, more flexible option for improved efficiency.

<title>When LLMs meet open-world graph learning: a new perspective for unlabeled data uncertainty</title>

arXiv:2505.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-attributed graph (TAG) learning. However, existing methods inadequately handle data uncertainty in open-world scenarios, especially concerning limited labeling and unknown-class nodes. Prior solutions typically rely on isolated semantic or structural approaches for unknown-class rejection, lacking effective annotation pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose Open-world Graph Assistant (OGA), an LLM-based framework that combines adaptive label traceability, which integrates semantics and topology for unknown-class rejection, and a graph label annotator to enable model updates using newly annotated nodes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate OGA's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: To enhance the reliability and credibility of graph neural networks (GNNs) and improve the transparency of their decision logic, a new field of explainability of GNNs (XGNN) has emerged. However, two major limitations severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b) impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility. To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing research on judicial sentencing prediction predominantly relies on end-to-end models, which often neglect the inherent sentencing logic and lack interpretability-a critical requirement for both scholarly research and judicial practice. To address this challenge, we make three key contributions:First, we propose a novel Saturated Mechanistic Sentencing (SMS) model, which provides inherent legal interpretability by virtue of its foundation in China's Criminal Law. We also introduce the corresponding Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) adaptive algorithm for this model. Second, for the MLMS algorithm based adaptive sentencing predictor, we establish a mathematical theory on the accuracy of adaptive prediction without resorting to any stationarity and independence assumptions on the data. We also provide a best possible upper bound for the prediction accuracy achievable by the best predictor designed in the known parameters case. Third, we construct a Chinese Intentional Bodily Harm (CIBH) dataset. Utilizing this real-world data, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction accuracy that is not far from the best possible theoretical upper bound, validating both the model's suitability and the algorithm's accuracy.

Abstract: Although adversarial training is known to be effective against adversarial examples, training dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we present the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training in random deep neural networks without any assumptions on data distributions. We introduce a new theoretical framework based on mean field theory, which addresses the limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework, we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$ and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity. We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.

<title>FedGraM: Defending Against Untargeted Attacks in Federated Learning via Embedding Gram Matrix</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14024</link>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables geographically distributed clients to collaboratively train machine learning models by sharing only their local models, ensuring data privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to untargeted attacks that aim to degrade the global model's performance on the underlying data distribution. Existing defense mechanisms attempt to improve FL's resilience against such attacks, but their effectiveness is limited in practical FL environments due to data heterogeneity. On the contrary, we aim to detect and remove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays a crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate that, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing different classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct accuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method, FedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server maintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support aggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings. Then, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for each local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class separation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes potentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms, then averages the remaining local models to form the global model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedGraM. Our empirical results show that with limited data samples used to construct the auxiliary dataset, FedGraM achieves exceptional performance, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods.

<title>Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening</title>

Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time. Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Learning High-dimensional Ionic Model Dynamics Using Fourier Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: Ionic models, described by systems of stiff ordinary differential equations, are fundamental tools for simulating the complex dynamics of excitable cells in both Computational Neuroscience and Cardiology. Approximating these models using Artificial Neural Networks poses significant challenges due to their inherent stiffness, multiscale nonlinearities, and the wide range of dynamical behaviors they exhibit, including multiple equilibrium points, limit cycles, and intricate interactions. While in previous studies the dynamics of the transmembrane potential has been predicted in low dimensionality settings, in the present study we extend these results by investigating whether Fourier Neural Operators can effectively learn the evolution of all the state variables within these dynamical systems in higher dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by accurately learning the dynamics of three well-established ionic models with increasing dimensionality: the two-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the forty-one-variable O'Hara-Rudy model. To ensure the selection of near-optimal configurations for the Fourier Neural Operator, we conducted automatic hyperparameter tuning under two scenarios: an unconstrained setting, where the number of trainable parameters is not limited, and a constrained case with a fixed number of trainable parameters. Both constrained and unconstrained architectures achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy across all the models considered. However, the unconstrained architecture required approximately half the number of training epochs to achieve similar error levels, as evidenced by the loss function values recorded during training. These results underline the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators to accurately capture complex multiscale dynamics, even in high-dimensional dynamical systems.

<title>Unsupervised Graph Clustering with Deep Structural Entropy</title>

Abstract: Research on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) provides key insights for graph-based clustering, yet current methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and contrastive learning often rely heavily on the original graph structure. Their performance deteriorates when the original graph's adjacency matrix is too sparse or contains noisy edges unrelated to clustering. Moreover, these methods depend on learning node embeddings and using traditional techniques like k-means to form clusters, which may not fully capture the underlying graph structure between nodes. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DeSE, a novel unsupervised graph clustering framework incorporating Deep Structural Entropy. It enhances the original graph with quantified structural information and deep neural networks to form clusters. Specifically, we first propose a method for calculating structural entropy with soft assignment, which quantifies structure in a differentiable form. Next, we design a Structural Learning layer (SLL) to generate an attributed graph from the original feature data, serving as a target to enhance and optimize the original structural graph, thereby mitigating the issue of sparse connections between graph nodes. Finally, our clustering assignment method (ASS), based on GNNs, learns node embeddings and a soft assignment matrix to cluster on the enhanced graph. The ASS layer can be stacked to meet downstream task requirements, minimizing structural entropy for stable clustering and maximizing node consistency with edge-based cross-entropy loss. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets against eight representative unsupervised graph clustering baselines, demonstrating the superiority of the DeSE in both effectiveness and interpretability.

<title>Adversarially Pretrained Transformers may be Universally Robust In-Context Learners</title>

Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context demonstrations. The code is available at https://github.com/s-kumano/universally-robust-in-context-learner.

<title>Generalized Category Discovery via Token Manifold Capacity Learning</title>

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is essential for improving deep learning models' robustness in open-world scenarios by clustering unlabeled data containing both known and novel categories. Traditional GCD methods focus on minimizing intra-cluster variations, often sacrificing manifold capacity, which limits the richness of intra-class representations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Maximum Token Manifold Capacity (MTMC), that prioritizes maximizing the manifold capacity of class tokens to preserve the diversity and complexity of data. MTMC leverages the nuclear norm of singular values as a measure of manifold capacity, ensuring that the representation of samples remains informative and well-structured. This method enhances the discriminability of clusters, allowing the model to capture detailed semantic features and avoid the loss of critical information during clustering. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on coarse- and fine-grained datasets, we demonstrate that MTMC outperforms existing GCD methods, improving both clustering accuracy and the estimation of category numbers. The integration of MTMC leads to more complete representations, better inter-class separability, and a reduction in dimensional collapse, establishing MTMC as a vital component for robust open-world learning. Code is in github.com/lytang63/MTMC.

Abstract: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to +3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel data-centric paradigm to maximize the utility of unlabeled data, tackling a critical question: How can we enhance the efficiency and sustainability of deep learning training by optimizing the data itself? We begin by identifying three key limitations in existing model-centric approaches, all rooted in a shared bottleneck: knowledge extracted from data is locked to model parameters, hindering its reusability and scalability. To this end, we propose CoOpt, a highly efficient, parallelized framework for collaborative unlabeled data optimization, thereby effectively encoding knowledge into the data itself. By distributing unlabeled data and leveraging publicly available task-agnostic models, CoOpt facilitates scalable, reusable, and sustainable training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency, achieving 13.6% and 6.8% improvements on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, respectively, with training speedups of $1.94 \times $ and $1.2 \times$.

Abstract: This study investigates the multifaceted factors influencing wildfire risk in Iran, focusing on the interplay between climatic conditions and human activities. Utilizing advanced remote sensing, geospatial information system (GIS) processing techniques such as cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms, this research analyzed the impact of climatic parameters, topographic features, and human-related factors on wildfire susceptibility assessment and prediction in Iran. Multiple scenarios were developed for this purpose based on the data sampling strategy. The findings revealed that climatic elements such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity significantly contribute to wildfire susceptibility, while human activities-particularly population density and proximity to powerlines-also played a crucial role. Furthermore, the seasonal impact of each parameter was separately assessed during warm and cold seasons. The results indicated that human-related factors, rather than climatic variables, had a more prominent influence during the seasonal analyses. This research provided new insights into wildfire dynamics in Iran by generating high-resolution wildfire susceptibility maps using advanced machine learning classifiers. The generated maps identified high risk areas, particularly in the central Zagros region, the northeastern Hyrcanian Forest, and the northern Arasbaran forest, highlighting the urgent need for effective fire management strategies.

arXiv:2505.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners' learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans, enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus promoting the sustainable development of education.

<title>A Methodological Framework for Measuring Spatial Labeling Similarity</title>

Abstract: Spatial labeling assigns labels to specific spatial locations to characterize their spatial properties and relationships, with broad applications in scientific research and practice. Measuring the similarity between two spatial labelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing factors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An adequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should consider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of spatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels. However, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the development of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial labelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location organization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The distributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an efficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the dissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete implementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric (SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating spatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \textit{as per} their similarity with ground truth labeling. Through a series of carefully designed experimental cases involving both simulated and real ST data, we demonstrate that SLAM provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of labeling quality compared to other well-established evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/YihDu/SLAM.

Abstract: Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT), which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.

Abstract: The use of guidance to steer sampling toward desired outcomes has been widely explored within diffusion models, especially in applications such as image and trajectory generation. However, incorporating guidance during training remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce energy-guided flow matching, a novel approach that enhances the training of flow models and eliminates the need for guidance at inference time. We learn a conditional velocity field corresponding to the flow policy by approximating an energy-guided probability path as a Gaussian path. Learning guided trajectories is appealing for tasks where the target distribution is defined by a combination of data and an energy function, as in reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based policies have recently attracted attention for their expressive power and ability to capture multi-modal action distributions. Typically, these policies are optimized using weighted objectives or by back-propagating gradients through actions sampled by the policy. As an alternative, we propose FlowQ, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on energy-guided flow matching. Our method achieves competitive performance while the policy training time is constant in the number of flow sampling steps.

Abstract: Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA, a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation. At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.

<title>Nonparametric Teaching for Graph Property Learners</title>

Abstract: Inferring properties of graph-structured data, e.g., the solubility of molecules, essentially involves learning the implicit mapping from graphs to their properties. This learning process is often costly for graph property learners like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). To address this, we propose a paradigm called Graph Neural Teaching (GraNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter offers a theoretical framework for teaching implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) mappings via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is realized by a dense set of graph-property pairs, with the GraNT teacher selecting a subset of them to promote faster convergence in GCN training. By analytically examining the impact of graph structure on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of GCNs--shaped by parameter updates--through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching graph property learners (i.e., GCNs) is consistent with teaching structure-aware nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit GraNT to enhancing learning efficiency of the graph property learner, showing significant reductions in training time for graph-level regression (-36.62%), graph-level classification (-38.19%), node-level regression (-30.97%) and node-level classification (-47.30%), all while maintaining its generalization performance.

<title>Safety Subspaces are Not Distinct: A Fine-Tuning Case Study</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially acceptable responses. This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data, can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from distinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and activation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe behaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety implications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a subspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the assumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in distinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact components of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that subspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the need for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training. We corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source LLMs. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/safety-subspaces.

<title>$\alpha$-GAN by R\'{e}nyi Cross Entropy</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes $\alpha$-GAN, a generative adversarial network using R\'{e}nyi measures. The value function is formulated, by R\'{e}nyi cross entropy, as an expected certainty measure incurred by the discriminator's soft decision as to where the sample is from, true population or the generator. The discriminator tries to maximize the R\'{e}nyi certainty about sample source, while the generator wants to reduce it by injecting fake samples. This forms a min-max problem with the solution parameterized by the R\'{e}nyi order $\alpha$. This $\alpha$-GAN reduces to vanilla GAN at $\alpha = 1$, where the value function is exactly the binary cross entropy. The optimization of $\alpha$-GAN is over probability (vector) space. It is shown that the gradient is exponentially enlarged when R\'{e}nyi order is in the range $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This makes convergence faster, which is verified by experimental results. A discussion shows that choosing $\alpha \in (0,1)$ may be able to solve some common problems, e.g., vanishing gradient. A following observation reveals that this range has not been fully explored in the existing R\'{e}nyi version GANs.

Abstract: The transformer's attention mechanism has revolutionized AI and machine learning, with its efficient computation being crucial to its performance. However, calculating attention involves matrix operations interspersed with softmax rescaling, which inherently slows down computation and requires processing the entire input sequence. Building on online softmax computation, FlashAttention integrates softmax calculation with matrix arithmetic, enabling tiled computation independent of sequence length. While optimized for GPUs, FlashAttention's simplicity makes it amenable to direct hardware acceleration. This work re-evaluates the core FlashAttention kernel, presenting FLASH-D a mathematically equivalent, yet simplified, formulation that achieves: (a) hiding softmax division within other non-linear function evaluations; (b) inherently numerically stable computation of exponentials, eliminating the need for maximum value subtraction; and (c) a reduction in computational cost without introducing numerical approximations to the FlashAttention kernel. Importantly, the essential FlashAttention properties that facilitate efficient tiled implementation are fully preserved. Hardware implementation results at 28nm demonstrate that this proposed formulation achieves a 22.8% reduction in area and a 20.3% reduction in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art parallel hardware architectures without any performance penalty.

<title>MSDformer: Multi-scale Discrete Transformer For Time Series Generation</title>

Abstract: Discrete Token Modeling (DTM), which employs vector quantization techniques, has demonstrated remarkable success in modeling non-natural language modalities, particularly in time series generation. While our prior work SDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM approaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns inherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical foundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we proposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called Multi-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale time series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple scales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data. Subsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling technique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the discrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM method and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale patterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in DTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile sensors has the potential to provide massive and heterogeneous time series data, driving Artificial Intelligence applications in mHealth. However, data collection remains limited due to stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints, hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a promising solution to address both data scarcity and privacy issues. Yet, these models are often limited to short-term, unimodal signal patterns. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time series synthesis, with a focus on their ability to jointly handle multi-modality, long-range dependencies, and conditional generation-key challenges in the mHealth domain. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce a novel evaluation framework designed to measure both the intrinsic quality of synthetic data and its utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of generative models in mHealth.

Abstract: Link prediction in dynamic networks remains a fundamental challenge in network science, requiring the inference of potential interactions and their evolving strengths through spatiotemporal pattern analysis. Traditional static network methods have inherent limitations in capturing temporal dependencies and weight dynamics, while tensor-based methods offer a promising paradigm by encoding dynamic networks into high-order tensors to explicitly model multidimensional interactions across nodes and time. Among them, tensor wheel decomposition (TWD) stands out for its innovative topological structure, which decomposes high-order tensors into cyclic factors and core tensors to maintain structural integrity. To improve the prediction accuracy, this study introduces a PID-controlled tensor wheel decomposition (PTWD) model, which mainly adopts the following two ideas: 1) exploiting the representation power of TWD to capture the latent features of dynamic network topology and weight evolution, and 2) integrating the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle into the optimization process to obtain a stable model parameter learning scheme. The performance on four real datasets verifies that the proposed PTWD model has more accurate link prediction capabilities compared to other models.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued random variables.

Abstract: This study explores the use of Federated Learning (FL) for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis using chest X-rays in low-resource settings across Africa. FL allows hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data, addressing privacy concerns and data scarcity that hinder traditional centralized models. The research involved hospitals and research centers in eight African countries. Most sites used local datasets, while Ghana and The Gambia used public ones. The study compared locally trained models with a federated model built across all institutions to evaluate FL's real-world feasibility. Despite its promise, implementing FL in sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges such as poor infrastructure, unreliable internet, limited digital literacy, and weak AI regulations. Some institutions were also reluctant to share model updates due to data control concerns. In conclusion, FL shows strong potential for enabling AI-driven healthcare in underserved regions, but broader adoption will require improvements in infrastructure, education, and regulatory support.

Abstract: Shannon entropy (SE) and its quantum mechanical analogue von Neumann entropy are key components in many tools used in physics, information theory, machine learning (ML) and quantum computing. Besides of the significant amounts of SE computations required in these fields, the singularity of the SE gradient is one of the central mathematical reason inducing the high cost, frequently low robustness and slow convergence of such tools. Here we propose the Fast Entropy Approximation (FEA) - a non-singular rational approximation of Shannon entropy and its gradient that achieves a mean absolute error of $10^{-3}$, which is approximately $20$ times lower than comparable state-of-the-art methods. FEA allows around $50\%$ faster computation, requiring only $5$ to $6$ elementary computational operations, as compared to tens of elementary operations behind the fastest entropy computation algorithms with table look-ups, bitshifts, or series approximations. On a set of common benchmarks for the feature selection problem in machine learning, we show that the combined effect of fewer elementary operations, low approximation error, and a non-singular gradient allows significantly better model quality and enables ML feature extraction that is two to three orders of magnitude faster and computationally cheaper when incorporating FEA into AI tools.

Abstract: Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private second moment estimation and present a new algorithm that achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs even for worst-case inputs under subsamplability assumptions on the data. We call an input $(m,\alpha,\beta)$-subsamplable if a random subsample of size $m$ (or larger) preserves w.p $\geq 1-\beta$ the spectral structure of the original second moment matrix up to a multiplicative factor of $1\pm \alpha$. Building upon subsamplability, we give a recursive algorithmic framework similar to Kamath et al 2019, that abides zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP) while preserving w.h.p. the accuracy of the second moment estimation upto an arbitrary factor of $(1\pm\gamma)$. We then show how to apply our algorithm to approximate the second moment matrix of a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, even when a noticeable fraction of the input are outliers.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.

Abstract: Function approximation is a critical task in various fields. However, existing neural network approaches struggle with locally complex or discontinuous functions due to their reliance on a single global model covering the entire problem space. We propose X-KAN, a novel method that optimizes multiple local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) through an evolutionary rule-based machine learning framework called XCSF. X-KAN combines KAN's high expressiveness with XCSF's adaptive partitioning capability by implementing local KAN models as rule consequents and defining local regions via rule antecedents. Our experimental results on artificial test functions and real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules). These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF, which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

<title>Scaling Law for Quantization-Aware Training</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT) addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size, training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments, we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels. Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer key insights for improving QAT research and development.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of tabular data in real-world applications, most benchmarks rely on average-case metrics, which fail to reveal how model behavior varies across diverse data regimes. To address this, we propose MultiTab, a benchmark suite and evaluation framework for multi-dimensional, data-aware analysis of tabular learning algorithms. Rather than comparing models only in aggregate, MultiTab categorizes 196 publicly available datasets along key data characteristics, including sample size, label imbalance, and feature interaction, and evaluates 13 representative models spanning a range of inductive biases. Our analysis shows that model performance is highly sensitive to such regimes: for example, models using sample-level similarity excel on datasets with large sample sizes or high inter-feature correlation, while models encoding inter-feature dependencies perform best with weakly correlated features. These findings reveal that inductive biases do not always behave as intended, and that regime-aware evaluation is essential for understanding and improving model behavior. MultiTab enables more principled model design and offers practical guidance for selecting models tailored to specific data characteristics. All datasets, code, and optimization logs are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LGAI-DILab/Multitab.

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in semi-supervised deep learning have introduced effective strategies for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification performance. This work proposes a semi-supervised framework that utilizes a distance-based weighting mechanism to prioritize critical training samples based on their proximity to test data. By focusing on the most informative examples, the method enhances model generalization and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios with noisy or imbalanced datasets. Building on techniques such as uncertainty consistency and graph-based representations, the approach addresses key challenges of limited labeled data while maintaining scalability. Experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements across key metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, consistently outperforming existing methods. This framework provides a robust and practical solution for semi-supervised learning, with potential applications in domains such as healthcare and security where data limitations pose significant challenges.

Abstract: As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that they remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence that models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To explore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we train a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word without explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box) approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting. Our findings highlight the promise of these approaches for eliciting hidden knowledge and suggest several promising avenues for future work, including testing and refining these methods on more complex model organisms. This work aims to be a step towards addressing the crucial problem of eliciting secret knowledge from language models, thereby contributing to their safe and reliable deployment.

<title>Layer-wise Quantization for Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging</title>

arXiv:2505.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit heterogeneity across numerous layers of various types such as residuals, multi-head attention, etc., due to varying structures (dimensions, activation functions, etc.), distinct representation characteristics, which impact predictions. We develop a general layer-wise quantization framework with tight variance and code-length bounds, adapting to the heterogeneities over the course of training. We then apply a new layer-wise quantization technique within distributed variational inequalities (VIs), proposing a novel Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging (QODA) algorithm with adaptive learning rates, which achieves competitive convergence rates for monotone VIs. We empirically show that QODA achieves up to a $150\%$ speedup over the baselines in end-to-end training time for training Wasserstein GAN on $12+$ GPUs.

<title>Algorithmic Hiring and Diversity: Reducing Human-Algorithm Similarity for Better Outcomes</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented hiring algorithms.

Abstract: Autonomous systems that rely on Machine Learning (ML) utilize online fault tolerance mechanisms, such as runtime monitors, to detect ML prediction errors and maintain safety during operation. However, the lack of human-interpretable explanations for these errors can hinder the creation of strong assurances about the system's safety and reliability. This paper introduces a novel fuzzy-based monitor tailored for ML perception components. It provides human-interpretable explanations about how different operating conditions affect the reliability of perception components and also functions as a runtime safety monitor. We evaluated our proposed monitor using naturalistic driving datasets as part of an automated driving case study. The interpretability of the monitor was evaluated and we identified a set of operating conditions in which the perception component performs reliably. Additionally, we created an assurance case that links unit-level evidence of \textit{correct} ML operation to system-level \textit{safety}. The benchmarking demonstrated that our monitor achieved a better increase in safety (i.e., absence of hazardous situations) while maintaining availability (i.e., ability to perform the mission) compared to state-of-the-art runtime ML monitors in the evaluated dataset.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Existing time series tokenization methods predominantly encode a constant number of samples into individual tokens. This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.

<title>Table Foundation Models: on knowledge pre-training for tabular learning</title>

Abstract: Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners, giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge pre-training for tabular learning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new interpretability method for neural networks, which is based on a novel mathematico-philosophical theory of reasons. Our method computes a vector for each neuron, called its reasons vector. We then can compute how strongly this reasons vector speaks for various propositions, e.g., the proposition that the input image depicts digit 2 or that the input prompt has a negative sentiment. This yields an interpretation of neurons, and groups thereof, that combines a logical and a Bayesian perspective, and accounts for polysemanticity (i.e., that a single neuron can figure in multiple concepts). We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this method is: (1) grounded in a philosophically established notion of explanation, (2) uniform, i.e., applies to the common neural network architectures and modalities, (3) scalable, since computing reason vectors only involves forward-passes in the neural network, (4) faithful, i.e., intervening on a neuron based on its reason vector leads to expected changes in model output, (5) correct in that the model's reasons structure matches that of the data source, (6) trainable, i.e., neural networks can be trained to improve their reason strengths, (7) useful, i.e., it delivers on the needs for interpretability by increasing, e.g., robustness and fairness.

<title>Interpretable Neural System Dynamics: Combining Deep Learning with System Dynamics Modeling to Support Critical Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to bridge the gap between Deep Learning (DL) and System Dynamics (SD) by developing an interpretable neural system dynamics framework. While DL excels at learning complex models and making accurate predictions, it lacks interpretability and causal reliability. Traditional SD approaches, on the other hand, provide transparency and causal insights but are limited in scalability and require extensive domain knowledge. To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Neural System Dynamics pipeline, integrating Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. This framework combines the predictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models, resulting in both causal reliability and scalability. The efficacy of the proposed pipeline will be validated through real-world applications of the EU-funded AutoMoTIF project, which is focused on autonomous multimodal transportation systems. The long-term goal is to collect actionable insights that support the integration of explainability and safety in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Missing values in high-dimensional, mixed-type datasets pose significant challenges for data imputation, particularly under Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms. Existing methods struggle to integrate local and global data characteristics, limiting performance in MNAR and high-dimensional settings. We propose an innovative framework, RefiDiff, combining local machine learning predictions with a novel Mamba-based denoising network capturing interrelationships among distant features and samples. Our approach leverages pre-refinement for initial warm-up imputations and post-refinement to polish results, enhancing stability and accuracy. By encoding mixed-type data into unified tokens, RefiDiff enables robust imputation without architectural or hyperparameter tuning. RefiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across missing-value settings, excelling in MNAR with a 4x faster training time than SOTA DDPM-based approaches. Extensive evaluations on nine real-world datasets demonstrate its robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in handling complex missingness patterns.

arXiv:2505.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to network control problems, such as load balancing. However, existing RL approaches often suffer from lack of interpretability and difficulty in extracting controller equations. In this paper, we propose the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for interpretable RL in network control. We employ a PPO agent with a 1-layer actor KAN model and an MLP Critic network to learn load balancing policies that maximise throughput utility, minimize loss as well as delay. Our approach allows us to extract controller equations from the learned neural networks, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate our approach using different reward functions demonstrating its effectiveness in improving network performance while providing interpretable policies.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system. Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.

<title>ServerlessLoRA: Minimizing Latency and Cost in Serverless Inference for LoRA-Based LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM) inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs.
  We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in insulin preparations and technology, adjusting insulin remains an ongoing challenge for the majority of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and longstanding type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we propose the Adaptive Basal-Bolus Advisor (ABBA), a personalised insulin treatment recommendation approach based on reinforcement learning for individuals with T1D and T2D, performing self-monitoring blood glucose measurements and multiple daily insulin injection therapy. We developed and evaluated the ability of ABBA to achieve better time-in-range (TIR) for individuals with T1D and T2D, compared to a standard basal-bolus advisor (BBA). The in-silico test was performed using an FDA-accepted population, including 101 simulated adults with T1D and 101 with T2D. An in-silico evaluation shows that ABBA significantly improved TIR and significantly reduced both times below- and above-range, compared to BBA. ABBA's performance continued to improve over two months, whereas BBA exhibited only modest changes. This personalised method for adjusting insulin has the potential to further optimise glycaemic control and support people with T1D and T2D in their daily self-management. Our results warrant ABBA to be trialed for the first time in humans.

arXiv:2505.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The secant losses can rapidly convert (via fine-tuning or distillation) a pretrained diffusion model into its secant version. In our experiments, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$. Code will be available.

Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood, with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.

Abstract: Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs), typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally, we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529), demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.

Abstract: Wind hazards such as tornadoes and straight-line winds frequently affect vulnerable communities in the Great Plains of the United States, where limited infrastructure and sparse data coverage hinder effective emergency response. Existing forecasting systems focus primarily on meteorological elements and often fail to capture community-specific vulnerabilities, limiting their utility for localized risk assessment and resilience planning. To address this gap, we propose an interpretable dual-stream learning framework that integrates structured numerical weather data with unstructured textual event narratives. Our architecture combines a Random Forest and RoBERTa-based transformer through a late fusion mechanism, enabling robust and context-aware wind hazard prediction. The system is tailored for underserved tribal communities and supports block-level risk assessment. Experimental results show significant performance gains over traditional baselines. Furthermore, gradient-based sensitivity and ablation studies provide insight into the model's decision-making process, enhancing transparency and operational trust. The findings demonstrate both predictive effectiveness and practical value in supporting emergency preparedness and advancing community resilience.

Abstract: Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight and black-box defense approach SifterNet is proposed through leveraging the memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The main novelty of our proposed approach lies in the introduction of ideology of Ising model. Extensive experiments also validate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of proper trigger purification and high accuracy achievement, and compared to the state-of-the-art baselines under several commonly-used datasets, our SiferNet has a significant superior performance.

Abstract: Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks. However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning. In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL) algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed. Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.

Abstract: Traditional time series models are task-specific and often depend on dataset-specific training and extensive feature engineering. While Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models, commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared, transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our $7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation learning.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally intensive and physically incomplete in traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods. Deep learning (DL) models offer efficiency and accuracy but often ignore physical laws, limiting interpretability and generalization. We propose PhyDL-NWP, a physics-guided deep learning framework that integrates physical equations with latent force parameterization into data-driven models. It predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss to align predictions with governing dynamics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both forecasting performance and physical consistency.

Abstract: This paper reviews the topological groundwork for the study of reinforcement learning (RL) by focusing on the structure of state, action, and policy spaces. We begin by recalling key mathematical concepts such as complete metric spaces, which form the foundation for expressing RL problems. By leveraging the Banach contraction principle, we illustrate how the Banach fixed-point theorem explains the convergence of RL algorithms and how Bellman operators, expressed as operators on Banach spaces, ensure this convergence. The work serves as a bridge between theoretical mathematics and practical algorithm design, offering new approaches to enhance the efficiency of RL. In particular, we investigate alternative formulations of Bellman operators and demonstrate their impact on improving convergence rates and performance in standard RL environments such as MountainCar, CartPole, and Acrobot. Our findings highlight how a deeper mathematical understanding of RL can lead to more effective algorithms for decision-making problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in various domains, and policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have gained popularity due to their balance in performance, training stability, and computational efficiency. These methods directly optimize policies through gradient-based updates. However, developing effective control policies for environments with complex and non-linear dynamics remains a challenge. High variance in gradient estimates and non-convex optimization landscapes often lead to unstable learning trajectories. Koopman Operator Theory has emerged as a powerful framework for studying non-linear systems through an infinite-dimensional linear operator that acts on a higher-dimensional space of measurement functions. In contrast with their non-linear counterparts, linear systems are simpler, more predictable, and easier to analyze. In this paper, we present Koopman-Inspired Proximal Policy Optimization (KIPPO), which learns an approximately linear latent-space representation of the underlying system's dynamics while retaining essential features for effective policy learning. This is achieved through a Koopman-approximation auxiliary network that can be added to the baseline policy optimization algorithms without altering the architecture of the core policy or value function. Extensive experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over the PPO baseline with 6-60% increased performance while reducing variability by up to 91% when evaluated on various continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial neural network pruning is a method in which artificial neural network sizes can be reduced while attempting to preserve the predicting capabilities of the network. This is done to make the model smaller or faster during inference time. In this work we analyze the ability of a selection of artificial neural network pruning methods to generalize to a new cybersecurity dataset utilizing a simpler network type than was designed for. We analyze each method using a variety of pruning degrees to best understand how each algorithm responds to the new environment. This has allowed us to determine the most well fit pruning method of those we searched for the task. Unexpectedly, we have found that many of them do not generalize to the problem well, leaving only a few algorithms working to an acceptable degree.

<title>Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers</title>

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across different PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers.

<title>CSTS: A Benchmark for the Discovery of Correlation Structures in Time Series Clustering</title>

Abstract: Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information, researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations, or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is "more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification; and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for correlation-based time series clustering.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network interatomic potentials have emerged as a promising research direction. However, popular deep learning models often lack auxiliary constraints grounded in physical laws, which could accelerate training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation, making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22 benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from 4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$-Module achieves best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient and lightweight in training.

<title>MMD-Newton Method for Multi-objective Optimization</title>

Abstract: Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely employed to measure the distance between probability distributions. In this paper, we propose using MMD to solve continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For solving MOPs, a common approach is to minimize the distance (e.g., Hausdorff) between a finite approximate set of the Pareto front and a reference set. Viewing these two sets as empirical measures, we propose using MMD to measure the distance between them. To minimize the MMD value, we provide the analytical expression of its gradient and Hessian matrix w.r.t. the search variables, and use them to devise a novel set-oriented, MMD-based Newton (MMDN) method. Also, we analyze the theoretical properties of MMD's gradient and Hessian, including the first-order stationary condition and the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which are important for verifying the correctness of MMDN. To solve complicated problems, we propose hybridizing MMDN with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), where we first execute an EA for several iterations to get close to the global Pareto front and then warm-start MMDN with the result of the MOEA to efficiently refine the approximation. We empirically test the hybrid algorithm on 11 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show the hybrid (MMDN + MOEA) can achieve a much better optimization accuracy than EA alone with the same computation budget.

Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development. Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug discovery outcomes.

<title>Enhancing Learned Knowledge in LoRA Adapters Through Efficient Contrastive Decoding on Ascend NPUs</title>

Abstract: Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search. These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models, resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model. This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective, a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models. To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud and on-premises settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and benchmark datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/mohbattharani/KERL.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding (PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form $R(\theta) \le \^{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is linked to high morbidity and mortality. In a fast-evolving AF rhythm control treatment era, predicting AF recurrence after its onset may be crucial to achieve the optimal therapeutic approach, yet traditional scores like CHADS2-VASc, HATCH, and APPLE show limited predictive accuracy. Moreover, early diagnosis studies often rely on codified electronic health record (EHR) data, which may contain errors and missing information.
  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to predict AF recurrence between one month and two years after onset by evaluating traditional clinical scores, ML models, and our LTM approach. Moreover, another objective is to develop a methodology for integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance tabular dataset quality.
  METHODS: A tabular dataset was generated by combining structured clinical data with free-text discharge reports processed through natural language processing techniques, reducing errors and annotation effort. A total of 1,508 patients with documented AF onset were identified, and models were evaluated on a manually annotated test set. The proposed approach includes a LTM compared against traditional clinical scores and ML models.
  RESULTS: The proposed LTM approach achieved the highest predictive performance, surpassing both traditional clinical scores and ML models. Additionally, the gender and age bias analyses revealed demographic disparities.
  CONCLUSION: The integration of structured data and free-text sources resulted in a high-quality dataset. The findings emphasize the limitations of traditional clinical scores in predicting AF recurrence and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches, particularly our LTM model.

Abstract: As healthcare systems increasingly adopt advanced wireless networks and connected devices, securing medical applications has become critical. The integration of Internet of Medical Things devices, such as robotic surgical tools, intensive care systems, and wearable monitors has enhanced patient care but introduced serious security risks. Cyberattacks on these devices can lead to life threatening consequences, including surgical errors, equipment failure, and data breaches. While the ITU IMT 2030 vision highlights 6G's transformative role in healthcare through AI and cloud integration, it also raises new security concerns. This paper explores how explainable AI techniques like SHAP, LIME, and DiCE can uncover vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses, and improve trust and transparency in 6G enabled healthcare. We support our approach with experimental analysis and highlight promising results.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has been paralleled by unprecedented increases in computational demands, with training costs for state-of-the-art models doubling every few months. Training models directly in low-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational throughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell architecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4 variants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g. linear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies performance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a "near-optimal" low-precision training technique in terms of accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized CUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training billion-scale models. Our method demonstrates that fully FP4-based training is a competitive alternative to standard-precision and FP8 training. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling, resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference. First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the Alipay's insurance product search...

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have emerged as promising foundation models for prediction from tabular data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small to moderate data sizes without tuning. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence. Several simulated and real-world data examples showcase the uncertainty quantification of our method in inference applications.

<title>SLOT: Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time</title>

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is available at https://github.com/maple-research-lab/SLOT.

Abstract: Effective Edge AI for space object detection (SOD) tasks that can facilitate real-time collision assessment and avoidance is essential with the increasing space assets in near-Earth orbits. In SOD, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites must detect other objects with high precision and minimal delay. We explore an Edge AI solution based on deep-learning-based vision sensing for SOD tasks and propose a deep learning model based on Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers, Vision Transformers (ViT), and YOLOv9 framework. We evaluate the performance of these models across various realistic SOD scenarios, demonstrating their ability to detect multiple satellites with high accuracy and very low latency.

<title>Algorithmic Tradeoffs in Fair Lending: Profitability, Compliance, and Long-Term Impact</title>

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to automate lending decisions, concerns about algorithmic fairness have risen. This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model (fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with business objectives.

<title>RTL++: Graph-enhanced LLM for RTL Code Generation</title>

Abstract: As hardware design complexity escalates, there is an urgent need for advanced automation in electronic design automation (EDA). Traditional register transfer level (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. While commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows promising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns. Open-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in quality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data essential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++, a first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes graph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated code. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data flow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and relationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances the context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate instructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations, RTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code and suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++ outperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated using the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1 model, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing the capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.

Abstract: Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot performance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit ordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns, misclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the importance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment.

Abstract: Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them. Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations. This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using "common-sense" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of "common sense" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions. The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the user/customer can take their own decisions.

<title>Polymer Data Challenges in the AI Era: Bridging Gaps for Next-Generation Energy Materials</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance, and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into accelerants.

<title>ADALog: Adaptive Unsupervised Anomaly detection in Logs with Self-attention Masked Language Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13496</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software systems generate extensive heterogeneous log data with dynamic formats, fragmented event sequences, and varying temporal patterns, making anomaly detection both crucial and challenging. To address these complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird, and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on model behavior and interpretability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

Abstract: Algorithmic bias has been the subject of much recent controversy. To clarify what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves' are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases, and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring, policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns, and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated discrimination.

Abstract: This study explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for real-world tasks, including freelance software development. This work presents a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on freelance programming and data analysis tasks derived from economic data. We construct the benchmark using synthetic tasks created from a Kaggle Freelancer dataset of job postings, with all job prices standardized to USD (median fixed-project price around $250, and an average of $306). Each task is accompanied by structured input-output test cases and an estimated price tag, enabling automated correctness checking and a monetary performance valuation. This approach is inspired by OpenAI's recent SWE-Lancer benchmark (1,400 real Upwork tasks worth $1M total). Still, our framework simplifies evaluation using programmatically testable tasks and predicted price values, making it highly scalable and repeatable. On this benchmark, we evaluate four modern LLMs - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen 2.5, and Mistral. We report each model's accuracy (task success rate and test-case pass rate) and the total "freelance earnings" it achieves (sum of prices of solved tasks). Our results show that Claude 3.5 Haiku performs best, earning approximately $1.52 million USD, followed closely by GPT-4o-mini at $1.49 million, then Qwen 2.5 ($1.33M) and Mistral ($0.70M). We analyze the distribution of errors per task and observe that the strongest models solve the most tasks and rarely fail completely on any project. We discuss the implications of these results for the feasibility of AI as a freelance developer, the advantages and limitations of our automated benchmark approach, and the gap between performance on structured tasks versus the true complexity of real-world freelance jobs.

Abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant obstacle in machine learning, as an unequal distribution of class labels often results in skewed predictions and diminished model accuracy. To mitigate this problem, various resampling strategies have been developed, encompassing both oversampling and undersampling techniques aimed at modifying class proportions. Conventional oversampling approaches like SMOTE enhance the representation of the minority class, whereas undersampling methods focus on trimming down the majority class. Advances in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more complex solutions, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of producing high-quality synthetic examples. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of data balancing methods, classifying them into categories including synthetic oversampling, adaptive techniques, generative models, ensemble-based strategies, hybrid approaches, undersampling, and neighbor-based methods. Furthermore, it highlights current developments in resampling techniques and discusses practical implementations and case studies that validate their effectiveness. The paper concludes by offering perspectives on potential directions for future exploration in this domain.

Abstract: Real-world data distributions often shift continuously across multiple latent factors such as time, geography, and socioeconomic context. However, existing domain generalization approaches typically treat domains as discrete or evolving along a single axis (e.g., time), which fails to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of continuous variation descriptors. We present a principled framework grounded in geometric and algebraic theory, showing that optimal model parameters across domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLTO), which enables structured parameter transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To handle noisy or incomplete domain descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets-including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic forecasting-demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in generalization accuracy and robustness under descriptor imperfections.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.

Abstract: Financial tasks are pivotal to global economic stability; however, their execution faces challenges including labor intensive processes, low error tolerance, data fragmentation, and tool limitations. Although large language models (LLMs) have succeeded in various natural language processing tasks and have shown potential in automating workflows through reasoning and contextual understanding, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in finance lack sufficient domain-specific data, have simplistic task design, and incomplete evaluation frameworks. To address these gaps, this article presents FinMaster, a comprehensive financial benchmark designed to systematically assess the capabilities of LLM in financial literacy, accounting, auditing, and consulting. Specifically, FinMaster comprises three main modules: i) FinSim, which builds simulators that generate synthetic, privacy-compliant financial data for companies to replicate market dynamics; ii) FinSuite, which provides tasks in core financial domains, spanning 183 tasks of various types and difficulty levels; and iii) FinEval, which develops a unified interface for evaluation. Extensive experiments over state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical capability gaps in financial reasoning, with accuracy dropping from over 90% on basic tasks to merely 40% on complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning. This degradation exhibits the propagation of computational errors, where single-metric calculations initially demonstrating 58% accuracy decreased to 37% in multimetric scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, FinMaster is the first benchmark that covers full-pipeline financial workflows with challenging tasks. We hope that FinMaster can bridge the gap between research and industry practitioners, driving the adoption of LLMs in real-world financial practices to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance, we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages. Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code generator.

<title>Learning Collision Risk from Naturalistic Driving with Generalised Surrogate Safety Measures</title>

Abstract: Accurate and timely alerts for drivers or automated systems to unfolding collisions remains a challenge in road safety, particularly in highly interactive urban traffic. Existing approaches require labour-intensive annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying interaction context, or are useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these limits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM), a new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe extreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by context-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road users. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails higher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its associated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values. Any measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve as part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical interactions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which are tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from the SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of 0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential collisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance gains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and crossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and generalisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic interactions.

Abstract: Accurately predicting customers' purchase intentions is critical to the success of a business strategy. Current researches mainly focus on analyzing the specific types of products that customers are likely to purchase in the future, little attention has been paid to the critical factor of whether customers will engage in repurchase behavior. Predicting whether a customer will make the next purchase is a classic time series forecasting task. However, in real-world purchasing behavior, customer groups typically exhibit imbalance - i.e., there are a large number of occasional buyers and a small number of loyal customers. This head-to-tail distribution makes traditional time series forecasting methods face certain limitations when dealing with such problems. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a unified Clustering and Attention mechanism GRU model (CAGRU) that leverages multi-modal data for customer purchase intention prediction. The framework first performs customer profiling with respect to the customer characteristics and clusters the customers to delineate the different customer clusters that contain similar features. Then, the time series features of different customer clusters are extracted by GRU neural network and an attention mechanism is introduced to capture the significance of sequence locations. Furthermore, to mitigate the head-to-tail distribution of customer segments, we train the model separately for each customer segment, to adapt and capture more accurately the differences in behavioral characteristics between different customer segments, as well as the similar characteristics of the customers within the same customer segment. We constructed four datasets and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CAGRU approach.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its comprehensibility remains underexplored in LLMs. We introduce CS-Sum, to evaluate the comprehensibility of CS by the LLMs through CS dialogue to English summarization. CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs, underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.

Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with numerous applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with \citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism (e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that \coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic}, the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}. These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning, particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in game-theoretic settings.

Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS) and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic structure, and obtaining both the synthesised material and its reproducible synthesis protocol on demand may revolutionise materials design. Thus, ScatterLab provides a generalisable blueprint for autonomous, atomic structure-targeted synthesis across diverse systems and applications.

<title>Learning Wavelet-Sparse FDK for 3D Cone-Beam CT Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by $93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in environments with computational limitations.

Abstract: This work introduces a new method called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo (SBMC). The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior, and the algorithm is a parallel implementation of a consistent (asymptotically unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithm: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is motivated theoretically, and its utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.

Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields (NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs. While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners, we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank adaptation.

<title>Traceable Black-box Watermarks for Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local client has access to the global model, posing a critical risk of model leakage. Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.

<title>Optimal Client Sampling in Federated Learning with Client-Level Heterogeneous Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across clients, leading to excessive DP noise and significant model utility degradation. Existing methods to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal performance and lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed, we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA) algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal transport barycenter solvers.

Abstract: Modern applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems. Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our framework features a specialized few-shot example strategy, where each agent receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world banking dataset as well as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a 14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public benchmarks when compared with traditional single agent annotation techniques. Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making it well-suited for deployment in production applications while showing strong generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.

Abstract: Machine Learning Enabled Systems (MLS) are becoming integral to real-world applications, but ensuring their sustainable performance over time remains a significant challenge. These systems operate in dynamic environments and face runtime uncertainties like data drift and model degradation, which affect the sustainability of MLS across multiple dimensions: technical, economical, environmental, and social. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses the technical dimension by streamlining the ML model lifecycle, it overlooks other dimensions. Furthermore, some traditional practices, such as frequent retraining, incur substantial energy and computational overhead, thus amplifying sustainability concerns. To address them, we introduce HarmonE, an architectural approach that enables self-adaptive capabilities in MLOps pipelines using the MAPE-K loop. HarmonE allows system architects to define explicit sustainability goals and adaptation thresholds at design time, and performs runtime monitoring of key metrics, such as prediction accuracy, energy consumption, and data distribution shifts, to trigger appropriate adaptation strategies. We validate our approach using a Digital Twin (DT) of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), focusing on traffic flow prediction as our primary use case. The DT employs time series ML models to simulate real-time traffic and assess various flow scenarios. Our results show that HarmonE adapts effectively to evolving conditions while maintaining accuracy and meeting sustainability goals.

Abstract: We say that a classifier is \emph{adversarially robust} to perturbations of norm $r$ if, with high probability over a point $x$ drawn from the input distribution, there is no point within distance $\le r$ from $x$ that is classified differently. The \emph{boundary volume} is the probability that a point falls within distance $r$ of a point with a different label. This work studies the task of computationally efficient learning of hypotheses with small boundary volume, where the input is distributed as a subgaussian isotropic log-concave distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Linear threshold functions are adversarially robust; they have boundary volume proportional to $r$. Such concept classes are efficiently learnable by polynomial regression, which produces a polynomial threshold function (PTF), but PTFs in general may have boundary volume $\Omega(1)$, even for $r \ll 1$.
  We give an algorithm that agnostically learns linear threshold functions and returns a classifier with boundary volume $O(r+\varepsilon)$ at radius of perturbation $r$. The time and sample complexity of $d^{\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ matches the complexity of polynomial regression.
  Our algorithm augments the classic approach of polynomial regression with three additional steps: a) performing the $\ell_1$-error regression under noise sensitivity constraints, b) a structured partitioning and rounding step that returns a Boolean classifier with error $\textsf{opt} + O(\varepsilon)$ and noise sensitivity $O(r+\varepsilon)$ simultaneously, and c) a local corrector that ``smooths'' a function with low noise sensitivity into a function that is adversarially robust.

Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols: (1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2) code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for training energy-based models (EBM) with intractable normalisation terms. The key idea of NCE is to learn by comparing unnormalised log-likelihoods of the reference and noisy samples, thus avoiding explicitly computing normalisation terms. However, NCE critically relies on the quality of noisy samples. Recently, sliced score matching (SSM) has been popularised by closely related diffusion models (DM). Unlike NCE, SSM learns a gradient of log-likelihood, or score, by learning distribution of its projections on randomly chosen directions. However, both NCE and SSM disregard the form of log-likelihood function, which is problematic given that EBMs and DMs make use of first-order optimisation during inference. This paper proposes a new criterion that learns scores more suitable for first-order schemes. Experiments contrasts these approaches for training EBMs.

Abstract: Robots navigating complex environments must manage uncertainty from sensor noise, environmental changes, and incomplete information, with different tasks requiring varying levels of precision in different areas. For example, precise localization may be crucial near obstacles but less critical in open spaces. We present GUIDE (Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution), a framework that integrates these task-specific requirements into navigation policies via Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs). By assigning acceptable uncertainty levels to different locations, TSUMs enable robots to adapt uncertainty management based on context. When combined with reinforcement learning, GUIDE learns policies that balance task completion and uncertainty management without extensive reward engineering. Real-world tests show significant performance gains over methods lacking task-specific uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: As state-of-the-art language models continue to improve, the need for robust detection of machine-generated text becomes increasingly critical. However, current state-of-the-art machine text detectors struggle to adapt to new unseen domains and generative models. In this paper we present DoGEN (Domain Gating Ensemble Networks), a technique that allows detectors to adapt to unseen domains by ensembling a set of domain expert detector models using weights from a domain classifier. We test DoGEN on a wide variety of domains from leading benchmarks and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain detection while outperforming models twice its size on out-of-domain detection. We release our code and trained models to assist in future research in domain-adaptive AI detection.

Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs, our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs. We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs, as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.

<title>TranSUN: A Preemptive Paradigm to Eradicate Retransformation Bias Intrinsically from Regression Models in Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform), to serve the major online traffic. Codes will be released after this paper is published.

<title>Certifiably Safe Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects via Joint Shape and Tension Prediction</title>

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) is challenging due to their complex dynamics and the need for safe interaction in contact-rich environments. Most existing models focus on shape prediction alone and fail to account for contact and tension constraints, which can lead to damage to both the DLO and the robot. In this work, we propose a certifiably safe motion planning and control framework for DLO manipulation. At the core of our method is a predictive model that jointly estimates the DLO's future shape and tension. These predictions are integrated into a real-time trajectory optimizer based on polynomial zonotopes, allowing us to enforce safety constraints throughout the execution. We evaluate our framework on a simulated wire harness assembly task using a 7-DOF robotic arm. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a higher task success rate while avoiding all safety violations. The results demonstrate that our method enables robust and safe DLO manipulation in contact-rich environments.

<title>An Asymptotic Equation Linking WAIC and WBIC in Singular Models</title>

Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational efficiency of model selection in singular models.

Abstract: Scaling up high-quality trajectory data has long been a critical bottleneck for developing human-like computer use agents. We introduce PC Agent-E, an efficient agent training framework that significantly reduces reliance on large-scale human demonstrations. Starting with just 312 human-annotated computer use trajectories, we further improved data quality by synthesizing diverse action decisions with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Trained on these enriched trajectories, our PC Agent-E model achieved a remarkable 141% relative improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on WindowsAgentArena-V2, an improved benchmark we also released. Furthermore, PC Agent-E demonstrates strong generalizability to different operating systems on OSWorld. Our findings suggest that strong computer use capabilities can be stimulated from a small amount of high-quality trajectory data.

Abstract: Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation, and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning, according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning (ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even with a compact 8B LLM, outperforming full-size systems from existing solutions.

Abstract: In recent years, model collapse has become a critical issue in language model training, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate recursive parametric model training from a probabilistic perspective, aiming to characterize the conditions under which model collapse occurs and, crucially, how it can be mitigated. We conceptualize the recursive training process as a random walk of the model estimate, highlighting how the sample size influences the step size and how the estimation procedure determines the direction and potential bias of the random walk. Under mild conditions, we rigorously show that progressively increasing the sample size at each training step is necessary to prevent model collapse. In particular, when the estimation is unbiased, the required growth rate follows a superlinear pattern. This rate needs to be accelerated even further in the presence of substantial estimation bias. Building on this probabilistic framework, we also investigate the probability that recursive training on synthetic data yields models that outperform those trained solely on real data. Moreover, we extend these results to general parametric model family in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations and a real-world dataset.

<title>Through a Compressed Lens: Investigating the Impact of Quantization on LLM Explainability and Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Quantization methods are widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has extensively investigated the degradation of various LLM capabilities due to quantization, its effects on model explainability and interpretability, which are crucial for understanding decision-making processes, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three common quantization techniques at distinct bit widths, in conjunction with two explainability methods, counterfactual examples and natural language explanations, as well as two interpretability approaches, knowledge memorization analysis and latent multi-hop reasoning analysis. We complement our analysis with a thorough user study, evaluating selected explainability methods. Our findings reveal that, depending on the configuration, quantization can significantly impact model explainability and interpretability. Notably, the direction of this effect is not consistent, as it strongly depends on (1) the quantization method, (2) the explainability or interpretability approach, and (3) the evaluation protocol. In some settings, human evaluation shows that quantization degrades explainability, while in others, it even leads to improvements. Our work serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating that quantization can unpredictably affect model transparency. This insight has important implications for deploying LLMs in applications where transparency is a critical requirement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an important paradigm to solve combinatorial optimization problems primarily due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that can be generalized to other domains.

Abstract: Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope, respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs (KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel conditions encountered in clinical use.
  We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$ benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an $extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks, establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect, localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for education, student knowledge tracing and behavior modeling face persistent challenges: limited personalization, inadequate modeling of diverse learning activities (especially non-assessed materials), and overlooking the interplay between knowledge acquisition and behavioral patterns. Practical limitations, such as fixed-size sequence segmentation, frequently lead to the loss of contextual information vital for personalized learning. Moreover, reliance on student performance on assessed materials limits the modeling scope, excluding non-assessed interactions like lectures. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Knowledge Modeling and Material Prediction (KMaP), a stateful multi-task approach designed for personalized and simultaneous modeling of student knowledge and behavior. KMaP employs clustering-based student profiling to create personalized student representations, improving predictions of future learning resource preferences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm significant behavioral differences across student clusters and validate the efficacy of the KMaP model.

Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the covariate shift problem in the context of nonparametric regression within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Covariate shift arises in supervised learning when the input distributions of the training and test data differ, presenting additional challenges for learning. Although kernel methods have optimal statistical properties, their high computational demands in terms of time and, particularly, memory, limit their scalability to large datasets. To address this limitation, the main focus of this paper is to explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy under covariate shift. We investigate the use of random projections where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a given RKHS. Our results show that, even in the presence of covariate shift, significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising learning performance.

Abstract: We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret in terms of $\Delta$.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout, Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on diverse and often conflicting knowledge spanning multiple domains and time periods. Some of this knowledge is only valid within specific temporal contexts, such as answering the question, "Who is the President of the United States in 2022?" Ensuring LLMs generate time appropriate responses is crucial for maintaining relevance and accuracy. In this work we explore activation engineering as a method for temporally aligning LLMs to improve factual recall without any training or dataset creation. In this research we explore an activation engineering technique to ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method proposed by Zhao et al. (2024) . Notably, our approach achieves similar results to the fine-tuning baseline while being significantly more computationally efficient and requiring no pre-aligned datasets.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain under-explored. We present the first systematic audit of three public multilingual CLIP checkpoints -- M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, and CAPIVARA-CLIP -- across ten languages that vary in resource availability and grammatical gender. Using balanced subsets of \textsc{FairFace} and the \textsc{PATA} stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the assumption that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender bias than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared cross-lingual encoder of NLLB-CLIP transports English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this transfer. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all measured bias types, but even gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable when cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics conceal language-specific ``hot spots,'' underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual vision-language research.

<title>Hybrid Bernstein Normalizing Flows for Flexible Multivariate Density Regression with Interpretable Marginals</title>

Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.

<title>PL-FGSA: A Prompt Learning Framework for Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis Based on MindSpore</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FGSA) aims to identify sentiment polarity toward specific aspects within a text, enabling more precise opinion mining in domains such as product reviews and social media. However, traditional FGSA approaches often require task-specific architectures and extensive annotated data, limiting their generalization and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PL-FGSA, a unified prompt learning-based framework implemented using the MindSpore platform, which integrates prompt design with a lightweight TextCNN backbone. Our method reformulates FGSA as a multi-task prompt-augmented generation problem, jointly tackling aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and causal explanation in a unified paradigm. By leveraging prompt-based guidance, PL-FGSA enhances interpretability and achieves strong performance under both full-data and low-resource conditions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-SST-2, SemEval-2014 Task 4, and MAMS-demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods and achieves F1-scores of 0.922, 0.694, and 0.597, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of prompt-based generalization and highlight the practical value of PL-FGSA for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: LLMs are effective at code generation tasks like text-to-SQL, but is it worth the cost? Many state-of-the-art approaches use non-task-specific LLM techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency, and fine-tuning. These methods can be costly at inference time, sometimes requiring over a hundred LLM calls with reasoning, incurring average costs of up to \$0.46 per query, while fine-tuning models can cost thousands of dollars. We introduce "N-rep" consistency, a more cost-efficient text-to-SQL approach that achieves similar BIRD benchmark scores as other more expensive methods, at only \$0.039 per query. N-rep leverages multiple representations of the same schema input to mitigate weaknesses in any single representation, making the solution more robust and allowing the use of smaller and cheaper models without any reasoning or fine-tuning. To our knowledge, N-rep is the best-performing text-to-SQL approach in its cost range.

<title>From stability of Langevin diffusion to convergence of proximal MCMC for non-log-concave sampling</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability, classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model, termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and 0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN, QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.

<title>Mechanistic Fine-tuning for In-context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training, some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper, we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance, robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic interpretability.

<title>ABBA: Highly Expressive Hadamard Product Adaptation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/abba.

Abstract: This technical report presents a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach for systematically classifying scientific literature on childhood speech disorders. We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.

Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions, for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD approach.

Abstract: High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and 2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using our unsupervised ensemble approach.

<title>Optimizing Binary and Ternary Neural Network Inference on RRAM Crossbars using CIM-Explorer</title>

Abstract: Using Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) crossbars in Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures offers a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck. Due to non-idealities like cell variability, RRAM crossbars are often operated in binary mode, utilizing only two states: Low Resistive State (LRS) and High Resistive State (HRS). Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and Ternary Neural Networks (TNNs) are well-suited for this hardware due to their efficient mapping. Existing software projects for RRAM-based CIM typically focus on only one aspect: compilation, simulation, or Design Space Exploration (DSE). Moreover, they often rely on classical 8 bit quantization. To address these limitations, we introduce CIM-Explorer, a modular toolkit for optimizing BNN and TNN inference on RRAM crossbars. CIM-Explorer includes an end-to-end compiler stack, multiple mapping options, and simulators, enabling a DSE flow for accuracy estimation across different crossbar parameters and mappings. CIM-Explorer can accompany the entire design process, from early accuracy estimation for specific crossbar parameters, to selecting an appropriate mapping, and compiling BNNs and TNNs for a finalized crossbar chip. In DSE case studies, we demonstrate the expected accuracy for various mappings and crossbar parameters. CIM-Explorer can be found on GitHub.

<title>Taming Recommendation Bias with Causal Intervention on Evolving Personal Popularity</title>

Abstract: Popularity bias occurs when popular items are recommended far more frequently than they should be, negatively impacting both user experience and recommendation accuracy. Existing debiasing methods mitigate popularity bias often uniformly across all users and only partially consider the time evolution of users or items. However, users have different levels of preference for item popularity, and this preference is evolving over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called CausalEPP (Causal Intervention on Evolving Personal Popularity) for taming recommendation bias, which accounts for the evolving personal popularity of users. Specifically, we first introduce a metric called {Evolving Personal Popularity} to quantify each user's preference for popular items. Then, we design a causal graph that integrates evolving personal popularity into the conformity effect, and apply deconfounded training to mitigate the popularity bias of the causal graph. During inference, we consider the evolution consistency between users and items to achieve a better recommendation. Empirical studies demonstrate that CausalEPP outperforms baseline methods in reducing popularity bias while improving recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly within Transformer architectures and large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized sequence modeling in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. To compute attention for increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware accelerators. When implemented in a 28nm ASIC technology, they achieve improvements of 28.8% in area and 17.6% in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art hardware architectures with separate exponentials and vector multiplications hardware operators.

<title>Vulnerability of Transfer-Learned Neural Networks to Data Reconstruction Attacks in Small-Data Regime</title>

Abstract: Training data reconstruction attacks enable adversaries to recover portions of a released model's training data. We consider the attacks where a reconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between training data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed adversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data point can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However, differential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss in model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In this work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the distribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who attacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on this dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model and demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by DP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises significant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when protection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers transfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we point out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate metric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness. Instead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive reconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate.

Abstract: Plane geometry problem solving (PGPS) has recently gained significant attention as a benchmark to assess the multi-modal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models. Despite the growing interest in PGPS, the research community still lacks a comprehensive overview that systematically synthesizes recent work in PGPS. To fill this gap, we present a survey of existing PGPS studies. We first categorize PGPS methods into an encoder-decoder framework and summarize the corresponding output formats used by their encoders and decoders. Subsequently, we classify and analyze these encoders and decoders according to their architectural designs. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising directions for future research. In particular, we discuss the hallucination issues arising during the encoding phase within encoder-decoder architectures, as well as the problem of data leakage in current PGPS benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions, all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83% success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and broader engineering applications.

Abstract: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models to interactive world models.

Abstract: Causal world models are systems that can answer counterfactual questions about an environment of interest, i.e. predict how it would have evolved if an arbitrary subset of events had been realized differently. It requires understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing inference costs and spurious correlations.

Abstract: While humans naturally learn and adapt from past experiences, large language models (LLMs) and their agentic counterparts struggle to retain reasoning from previous tasks and apply them in future contexts. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, log-augmented generation (LAG) that directly reuses prior computation and reasoning from past logs at test time to enhance model's ability to learn from previous tasks and perform better on new, unseen challenges, all while keeping the system efficient and scalable. Specifically, our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy. Experiments on knowledge- and reasoning-intensive datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard agentic systems that do not utilize logs, as well as existing solutions based on reflection and KV cache techniques.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic, spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric properties, including web-related data like social network topology, query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and future directions.

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises through the analysis of earnings conference call transcripts has attracted increasing attention from the financial research community. Conference calls serve as critical communication channels between company executives, analysts, and shareholders, offering valuable forward-looking information. However, these transcripts present significant analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for language models. In this work, we propose the Sparse Autoencoder for Financial Representation Enhancement (SAE-FiRE) framework to address these limitations by extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to efficiently identify patterns and filter out noises, and focusing specifically on capturing nuanced financial signals that have predictive power for earnings surprises. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly outperform comparing baselines.

<title>A system identification approach to clustering vector autoregressive time series</title>

Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.

Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a specific speaker's speech from a mixture using speaker enrollment as a reference. While most existing approaches are discriminative, recent generative methods for TSE achieve strong results. However, generative methods for TSE remain underexplored, with most existing approaches relying on complex pipelines and pretrained components, leading to computational overhead. In this work, we present FlowTSE, a simple yet effective TSE approach based on conditional flow matching. Our model receives an enrollment audio sample and a mixed speech signal, both represented as mel-spectrograms, with the objective of extracting the target speaker's clean speech. Furthermore, for tasks where phase reconstruction is crucial, we propose a novel vocoder conditioned on the complex STFT of the mixed signal, enabling improved phase estimation. Experimental results on standard TSE benchmarks show that FlowTSE matches or outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/PAST

<title>Enhancing Interpretability of Sparse Latent Representations with Class Information</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14476</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability, especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations, characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not enforce such consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility and interpretability of latent representations.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust, showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.

Abstract: As machine learning models and autonomous agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes, real-world domains such as healthcare, security, finance, and robotics, the need for transparent and trustworthy explanations has become critical. To ensure end-to-end transparency of AI decisions, we need models that are not only accurate but also fully explainable and human-tunable. We introduce BACON, a novel framework for automatically training explainable AI models for decision making problems using graded logic. BACON achieves high predictive accuracy while offering full structural transparency and precise, logic-based symbolic explanations, enabling effective human-AI collaboration and expert-guided refinement. We evaluate BACON with a diverse set of scenarios: classic Boolean approximation, Iris flower classification, house purchasing decisions and breast cancer diagnosis. In each case, BACON provides high-performance models while producing compact, human-verifiable decision logic. These results demonstrate BACON's potential as a practical and principled approach for delivering crisp, trustworthy explainable AI.

<title>Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Weakly Guided Extraction of Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14517</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary. However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical. Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method, confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation steering.

Abstract: Gemini is increasingly used to perform tasks on behalf of users, where function-calling and tool-use capabilities enable the model to access user data. Some tools, however, require access to untrusted data introducing risk. Adversaries can embed malicious instructions in untrusted data which cause the model to deviate from the user's expectations and mishandle their data or permissions. In this report, we set out Google DeepMind's approach to evaluating the adversarial robustness of Gemini models and describe the main lessons learned from the process. We test how Gemini performs against a sophisticated adversary through an adversarial evaluation framework, which deploys a suite of adaptive attack techniques to run continuously against past, current, and future versions of Gemini. We describe how these ongoing evaluations directly help make Gemini more resilient against manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation, we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive, multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited to complex, interactive environments.

Abstract: Certain pairs of languages suffer from lack of a parallel corpus which is large in size and diverse in domain. One of the ways this is overcome is via use of a pivot language. In this paper we use Hindi as a pivot language to translate Nepali into English. We describe what makes Hindi a good candidate for the pivot. We discuss ways in which a pivot language can be used, and use two such approaches - the Transfer Method (fully supervised) and Backtranslation (semi-supervised) - to translate Nepali into English. Using the former, we are able to achieve a devtest Set SacreBLEU score of 14.2, which improves the baseline fully supervised score reported by (Guzman et al., 2019) by 6.6 points. While we are slightly below the semi-supervised baseline score of 15.1, we discuss what may have caused this under-performance, and suggest scope for future work.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker. This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck: Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding, reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents. We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii) standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.

Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US) Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC: 0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71, $\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of 4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal care.

Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach, the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

Abstract: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN) [WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors, pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

Abstract: Bootstrap methods have long been a cornerstone of ensemble learning in machine learning. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of bootstrap techniques applied to the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) ensemble in the context of large and growing sample sizes and feature dimensionalities. Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we investigate the performance of this classifier that aggregates decision functions from multiple weak classifiers, each trained on different subsets of the data. We provide insights into the use of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional settings, enhancing our understanding of their impact. Based on these findings, we propose strategies to select the number of subsets and the regularization parameter that maximize the performance of the LSSVM. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based, multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization, positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder, Doppler spread, and delay profile.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors, it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

<title>SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas</title>

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for future research in logical reasoning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches. We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a 3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of drawings.

Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations, applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization (DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy degradation relative to the full-precision model.

<title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However, visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space. Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/yilinye/AKRMap.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.

<title>Two Experts Are All You Need for Steering Thinking: Reinforcing Cognitive Effort in MoE Reasoning Models Without Additional Training</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances, existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts (RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by tokens like ''''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

Abstract: It has been observed that message-passing graph neural networks (GNN) sometimes struggle to maintain a healthy balance between the efficient/scalable modeling of long-range dependencies across nodes while avoiding unintended consequences such oversmoothed node representations, sensitivity to spurious edges, or inadequate model interpretability. To address these and other issues, two separate strategies have recently been proposed, namely implicit and unfolded GNNs (that we abbreviate to IGNN and UGNN respectively). The former treats node representations as the fixed points of a deep equilibrium model that can efficiently facilitate arbitrary implicit propagation across the graph with a fixed memory footprint. In contrast, the latter involves treating graph propagation as unfolded descent iterations as applied to some graph-regularized energy function. While motivated differently, in this paper we carefully quantify explicit situations where the solutions they produce are equivalent and others where their properties sharply diverge. This includes the analysis of convergence, representational capacity, and interpretability. In support of this analysis, we also provide empirical head-to-head comparisons across multiple synthetic and public real-world node classification benchmarks. These results indicate that while IGNN is substantially more memory-efficient, UGNN models support unique, integrated graph attention mechanisms and propagation rules that can achieve strong node classification accuracy across disparate regimes such as adversarially-perturbed graphs, graphs with heterophily, and graphs involving long-range dependencies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data by introducing a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a weighted time-delay feedback mechanism. Our proposed model, named $\tau$-GRU, is a discretized version of a continuous-time formulation of a recurrent unit, where the dynamics are governed by delay differential equations (DDEs). We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the continuous-time model and show that the proposed feedback mechanism can significantly improve the modeling of long-term dependencies. Our empirical results indicate that $\tau$-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art recurrent units and gated recurrent architectures on a range of tasks, achieving faster convergence and better generalization.

Abstract: We present a model-agnostic federated learning method for networks of heterogeneous data and models. The network structure reflects similarities between the (statistics of the) local datasets and, in turn, their associated local (personal) models. Our method is an instance of empirical risk minimization, with a regularization term derived from the network structure of the data. In particular, we require well-connected local models, which form clusters, to yield similar predictions on shared public, unlabelled dataset(s). The proposed method allows for a wide range of local models. The only restriction is that these local models must allow for efficient implementation of regularized empirical risk minimization (training). For many models, such implementations are readily available in high-level programming libraries, including scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving machine learning approach where private data remains local, enabling secure computations and the exchange of local model gradients between local clients and third-party parameter servers. However, recent findings reveal that privacy may be compromised and sensitive information potentially recovered from shared gradients. In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with many models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

Abstract: Predictions in the social world generally influence the target of prediction, a phenomenon known as performativity. Self-fulfilling and self-negating predictions are examples of performativity. Of fundamental importance to economics, finance, and the social sciences, the notion has been absent from the development of machine learning that builds on the static perspective of pattern recognition. In machine learning applications, however, performativity often surfaces as distribution shift. A predictive model deployed on a digital platform, for example, influences behavior and thereby changes the data-generating distribution. We discuss the recently founded area of performative prediction that provides a definition and conceptual framework to study performativity in machine learning. A key element of performative prediction is a natural equilibrium notion that gives rise to new optimization challenges. What emerges is a distinction between learning and steering, two mechanisms at play in performative prediction. Steering is in turn intimately related to questions of power in digital markets. The notion of performative power that we review gives an answer to the question how much a platform can steer participants through its predictions. We end on a discussion of future directions, such as the role that performativity plays in contesting algorithmic systems.

Abstract: Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.

Abstract: Generating probabilistic forecasts of potential outcomes and individual treatment effects (ITE) is essential for risk-aware decision-making in domains such as healthcare, policy, marketing, and finance. We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Combining data from different sources can improve data analysis tasks such as clustering. However, most of the current multi-view clustering methods are limited to specific domains or rely on a suboptimal and computationally intensive two-stage process of representation learning and clustering. We propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework for general data types (such as images and tables). Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Cluster assignments are learned by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound on the error caused by incorrect pseudo-labels in the unsupervised representations compared to LDA. Extensive experiments on ten multi-view clustering benchmark datasets provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), their computational complexity and storage space consumption have led to the concept of network compression. While DNN compression techniques such as pruning and low-rank decomposition have been extensively studied, there has been insufficient attention paid to their theoretical explanation. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical framework that leverages a probabilistic latent space of DNN weights and explains the optimal network sparsity by using the information-theoretic divergence measures. We introduce new analogous projected patterns (AP2) and analogous-in-probability projected patterns (AP3) notions for DNNs and prove that there exists a relationship between AP3/AP2 property of layers in the network and its performance. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains the training process of the compressed network. The theoretical results are empirically validated through experiments conducted on standard pre-trained benchmarks, including AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16, using CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Through our experiments, we highlight the relationship of AP3 and AP2 properties with fine-tuning pruned DNNs and sparsity levels.

Abstract: We describe a general reduction technique for analyzing learning algorithms that are subject to light-tailed (but not necessarily bounded) randomness, a scenario that is often the focus of theoretical analysis. We show that the analysis of such an algorithm can be reduced, in a black-box manner and with only a small loss in logarithmic factors, to an analysis of a simpler variant of the same algorithm that uses bounded random variables and is often easier to analyze. This approach simultaneously applies to any light-tailed randomization, including exponential, sub-Gaussian, and more general fast-decaying distributions, without needing to appeal to specialized concentration inequalities. Derivations of a generalized Azuma inequality, convergence bounds in stochastic optimization, and regret analysis in multi-armed bandits with general light-tailed randomization are provided to illustrate the technique.

Abstract: As the era of connectivity and unprecedented data generation expands, collaborative intelligence emerges as a key driver for machine learning, encouraging global-scale model development. Federated learning (FL) stands at the heart of this transformation, enabling distributed systems to work collectively on complex tasks while respecting strict constraints on privacy and security. Despite its vast potential, specially in the age of complex models, FL encounters challenges such as elevated communication costs, computational constraints, and the heterogeneous data distributions. In this context, we present AutoFLIP, a novel framework that optimizes FL through an adaptive hybrid pruning approach, grounded in a federated loss exploration phase. By jointly analyzing diverse non-IID client loss landscapes, AutoFLIP efficiently identifies model substructures for pruning both at structured and unstructured levels. This targeted optimization fosters a symbiotic intelligence loop, reducing computational burdens and boosting model performance on resource-limited devices for a more inclusive and democratized model usage. Our extensive experiments across multiple datasets and FL tasks show that AutoFLIP delivers quantifiable benefits: a 48.8% reduction in computational overhead, a 35.5% decrease in communication costs, and a notable improvement in global accuracy. By significantly reducing these overheads, AutoFLIP offer the way for efficient FL deployment in real-world applications for a scalable and broad applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling. LD3 can be combined with various samplers and consistently improves generation quality without having to retrain resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 improves sampling efficiency with much less computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 7 pre-trained models, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. We achieve FIDs of 2.38 (10 NFE), and 2.27 (10 NFE) on unconditional CIFAR10 and AFHQv2 in 5-10 minutes of training. LD3 offers an efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models. Code is available at https://github.com/vinhsuhi/LD3.

Abstract: Broad, open source availability of large pretrained foundation models on the internet through platforms such as HuggingFace has taken the world of practical deep learning by storm. A classical pipeline for neural network training now typically consists of finetuning these pretrained network on a small target dataset instead of training from scratch. In the case of large models this can be done even on modest hardware using a low rank training technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). While Low Rank training has already been studied in the continual learning setting, existing works often consider storing the learned adapter along with the existing model but rarely attempt to modify the weights of the pretrained model by merging the LoRA with the existing weights after finishing the training of each task. In this article we investigate this setting and study the impact of LoRA rank on the forgetting of the pretraining foundation task and on the plasticity and forgetting of subsequent ones. We observe that this rank has an important impact on forgetting of both the pretraining and downstream tasks. We also observe that vision transformers finetuned in that way exhibit a sort of ``contextual'' forgetting, a behaviour that we do not observe for residual networks and that we believe has not been observed yet in previous continual learning works.

<title>How Out-of-Distribution Detection Learning Theory Enhances Transformer: Learnability and Reliability</title>

Abstract: Transformers excel in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, they still face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, i.e. data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. OOD detection aims to distinguish outliers while preserving in-distribution (ID) data performance. This paper introduces the OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformers, which establishes the conditions for data distribution and model configurations for the OOD detection learnability of transformers. It shows that outliers can be accurately represented and distinguished with sufficient data under conditions. The theoretical implications highlight the trade-off between theoretical principles and practical training paradigms. By examining this trade-off, we naturally derived the rationale for leveraging auxiliary outliers to enhance OOD detection. Our theory suggests that by penalizing the misclassification of outliers within the loss function and strategically generating soft synthetic outliers, one can robustly bolster the reliability of transformer networks. This approach yields a novel algorithm that ensures learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inliers and outliers. In practice, the algorithm consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various data formats.

Abstract: Learning rate schedulers have shown great success in speeding up the convergence of learning algorithms in practice. However, their convergence to a minimum has not been proven theoretically. This difficulty mainly arises from the fact that, while traditional convergence analysis prescribes to monotonically decreasing (or constant) learning rates, schedulers opt for rates that often increase and decrease through the training epochs. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap by proposing a probabilistic learning rate scheduler (PLRS) that does not conform to the monotonically decreasing condition, with provable convergence guarantees. To cement the relevance and utility of our work in modern day applications, we show experimental results on deep neural network architectures such as ResNet, WRN, VGG, and DenseNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. We show that PLRS performs as well as or better than existing state-of-the-art learning rate schedulers in terms of convergence as well as accuracy. For example, while training ResNet-110 on the CIFAR-100 dataset, we outperform the state-of-the-art knee scheduler by $1.56\%$ in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, on the Tiny ImageNet dataset using ResNet-50 architecture, we show a significantly more stable convergence than the cosine scheduler and a better classification accuracy than the existing schedulers.

Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation are important for real-world intelligent systems. Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks. The code is made available at \href{https://github.com/Hyheng/STD-PLM}{https://github.com/Hyheng/STD-PLM}

Abstract: Next to scaling considerations, architectural design choices profoundly shape the solution space of transformers. In this work, we analyze the solutions simple transformer blocks implement when tackling the histogram task: counting items in sequences. Despite its simplicity, this task reveals a complex interplay between predictive performance, vocabulary and embedding sizes, token-mixing mechanisms, and feed-forward layer capacity. We identify two theoretical counting strategies transformers adopt, relation-based and inventory-based counting, each defining distinct learning regimes for the task. These strategies dictate how functionality is distributed between attention and feed-forward layers. We further show that adding softmax and beginning-of-sequence tokens allow for more robustness when embedding dimensions are comparatively small. Empirical introspection of trained models closely confirms both the learning regimes of the various architectures and the formation of these strategies during training. We demonstrate how a basic task that requires only aggregation and selection is significantly impacted by minor design changes.

<title>Towards the Causal Complete Cause of Multi-Modal Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause $C^3$. We begin by defining $C^3$, which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of $C^3$ and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying $C^3$ with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing $C^3$ risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: While the traditional formulation of machine learning tasks is in terms of performance on average, in practice we are often interested in how well a trained model performs on rare or difficult data points at test time. To achieve more robust and balanced generalization, methods applying sharpness-aware minimization to a subset of worst-case examples have proven successful for image classification tasks, but only using overparameterized neural networks under which the relative difference between "easy" and "hard" data points becomes negligible. In this work, we show how such a strategy can dramatically break down under simpler models where the difficulty gap becomes more extreme. As a more flexible alternative, instead of typical sharpness, we propose and evaluate a training criterion which penalizes poor loss concentration, which can be easily combined with loss transformations such exponential tilting, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that control tail emphasis.

Abstract: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift to large-scale foundation models has brought about a new era for deep learning that, while has found great success in practice, has also been plagued by prohibitively expensive costs in terms of high memory consumption and compute. To mitigate these issues, there has been a concerted effort in post-hoc neural network pruning techniques that do not require costly retraining. Despite the considerable progress being made, existing methods often exhibit a steady drop in model performance as the compression increases. In this paper, we present a novel approach to compressing large transformers, coined OATS, that utilizes the second moment information in the input embeddings to decompose the model weights into a sum of sparse and low-rank matrices. Without any retraining, OATS achieves state-of-the-art performance when compressing models by up to $60\%$ on large language models such as Llama-3 and Phi-3 and vision transformers such as ViT and DINOv2 while delivering up to $1.37\times$ the CPU acceleration versus a model that was comparably pruned.

Abstract: Our goal is to extract useful knowledge from demonstrations of behavior in sequential decision-making problems. Although it is well-known that humans commonly engage in risk-sensitive behaviors in the presence of stochasticity, most Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) models assume a risk-neutral agent. Beyond introducing model misspecification, these models do not directly capture the risk attitude of the observed agent, which can be crucial in many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel model of behavior in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that explicitly represents the agent's risk attitude through a utility function. We then define the Utility Learning (UL) problem as the task of inferring the observed agent's risk attitude, encoded via a utility function, from demonstrations in MDPs, and we analyze the partial identifiability of the agent's utility. Furthermore, we devise two provably efficient algorithms for UL in a finite-data regime, and we analyze their sample complexity. We conclude with proof-of-concept experiments that empirically validate both our model and our algorithms.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has become increasingly popular for quantifying the uncertainty associated with machine learning models. Recent work in graph uncertainty quantification has built upon this approach for conformal graph prediction. The nascent nature of these explorations has led to conflicting choices for implementations, baselines, and method evaluation. In this work, we analyze the design choices made in the literature and discuss the tradeoffs associated with existing methods. Building on the existing implementations, we introduce techniques to scale existing methods to large-scale graph datasets without sacrificing performance. Our theoretical and empirical results justify our recommendations for future scholarship in graph conformal prediction.

Abstract: There is an ongoing effort to develop feature selection algorithms to improve interpretability, reduce computational resources, and minimize overfitting in predictive models. Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We introduce EntryPrune, a novel supervised feature selection algorithm using a dense neural network with a dynamic sparse input layer. It employs entry-based pruning, a novel approach that compares neurons based on their relative change induced when they have entered the network. Extensive experiments on 13 different datasets show that our approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in particular improves the average accuracy on low-dimensional datasets. Furthermore, we show that EntryPruning surpasses traditional techniques such as magnitude pruning within the EntryPrune framework and that EntryPrune achieves lower runtime than competing approaches.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been a powerful tool for mesh-based physical simulation. To efficiently model large-scale systems, existing methods mainly employ hierarchical graph structures to capture multi-scale node relations. However, these graph hierarchies are typically manually designed and fixed, limiting their ability to adapt to the evolving dynamics of complex physical systems. We propose EvoMesh, a fully differentiable framework that jointly learns graph hierarchies and physical dynamics, adaptively guided by physical inputs. EvoMesh introduces anisotropic message passing, which enables direction-specific aggregation of dynamic features between nodes within each hierarchy, while simultaneously learning node selection probabilities for the next hierarchical level based on physical context. This design creates more flexible message shortcuts and enhances the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on five benchmark physical simulation datasets show that EvoMesh outperforms recent fixed-hierarchy message passing networks by large margins. Code is available at https://github.com/hbell99/EvoMesh.

Abstract: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is a cornerstone optimization algorithm in deep learning, widely recognized for its flexibility with adaptive learning rates and efficiency in handling large-scale data. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical understanding of Adam's convergence has been constrained by stringent assumptions, such as almost surely bounded stochastic gradients or uniformly bounded gradients, which are more restrictive than those typically required for analyzing stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
  In this paper, we introduce a novel and comprehensive framework for analyzing the convergence properties of Adam. This framework offers a versatile approach to establishing Adam's convergence. Specifically, we prove that Adam achieves asymptotic (last iterate sense) convergence in both the almost sure sense and the \(L_1\) sense under the relaxed assumptions typically used for SGD, namely \(L\)-smoothness and the ABC inequality. Meanwhile, under the same assumptions, we show that Adam attains non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds similar to those of SGD.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in learning from relational datasets as they preserve the symmetries of the graph domain. However, many complex systems -- such as biological or social networks -- involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the GNN ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software for defining, building, and training GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.

Abstract: Resampling from a target measure whose density is unknown is a fundamental problem in mathematical statistics and machine learning. A setting that dominates the machine learning literature consists of learning a map from an easy-to-sample prior, such as the Gaussian distribution, to a target measure. Under this model, samples from the prior are pushed forward to generate a new sample on the target measure, which is often difficult to sample from directly. Of particular interest is the problem of generating a new sample that is proximate to or otherwise conditioned on a given input sample. In this paper, we propose a new model called mirror bridges to solve this problem of conditional resampling. Our key observation is that solving the Schr\"odinger bridge problem between a distribution and itself provides a natural way to produce new samples from conditional distributions, giving in-distribution variations of an input data point. We demonstrate how to efficiently estimate the solution to this largely overlooked version of the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, and we prove that under mild conditions, the difference between our estimate and the true Schr\"odinger bridge can be controlled explicitly. We show that our proposed method leads to significant algorithmic simplifications over existing alternatives, in addition to providing control over in-distribution variation. Empirically, we demonstrate how these benefits can be leveraged to produce proximal samples in a number of application domains.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model has demonstrated good performance in generating promising drug molecules. The fine-tuning task is often formulated as a reinforcement learning problem, where previous methods efficiently learn to optimize a reward function to generate potential drug molecules. Nevertheless, in the absence of an adaptive update mechanism for the reward function, the optimization process can become stuck in local optima. The efficacy of the optimal molecule in a local optimization may not translate to usefulness in the subsequent drug optimization process or as a potential standalone clinical candidate. Therefore, it is important to generate a diverse set of promising molecules. Prior work has modified the reward function by penalizing structurally similar molecules, primarily focusing on finding molecules with higher rewards. To date, no study has comprehensively examined how different adaptive update mechanisms for the reward function influence the diversity of generated molecules. In this work, we investigate a wide range of intrinsic motivation methods and strategies to penalize the extrinsic reward, and how they affect the diversity of the set of generated molecules. Our experiments reveal that combining structure- and prediction-based methods generally yields better results in terms of diversity.

Abstract: Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT) is adopted to continually instruct Large Models to follow human intent data by data. It is observed that existing gradient update would heavily destroy the performance on previous datasets during CIT process. Instead, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), owns the ability to trace previous parameters, which can aid in decreasing forgetting. Nonetheless, its stable balance weight fails to deal with the ever-changing datasets, leading to the out-of-balance between plasticity and stability. In this paper, we propose a general continual instruction tuning framework to address the challenge. Starting from the trade-off prerequisite and EMA update, we propose the plasticity and stability ideal condition. Based on Taylor expansion in the loss function, we find the optimal balance weight can be automatically determined by the gradients and learned parameters. Therefore, we propose a stable-plasticity balanced coefficient to avoid knowledge interference. Based on the semantic similarity of the instructions, we can determine whether to retrain or expand the training parameters and allocate the most suitable parameters for the testing instances. Extensive experiments across multiple continual instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only enhances anti-forgetting capabilities but also significantly improves overall continual tuning performance.

Abstract: Offline RL is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our ``RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three target tracking tasks in a challenging, stochastic tokamak control simulator.

Abstract: As deep learning continues to evolve, the need for data efficiency becomes increasingly important. Considering labeling large datasets is both time-consuming and expensive, active learning (AL) provides a promising solution to this challenge by iteratively selecting the most informative subsets of examples to train deep neural networks, thereby reducing the labeling cost. However, the effectiveness of different AL algorithms can vary significantly across data scenarios, and determining which AL algorithm best fits a given task remains a challenging problem. This work presents the first differentiable AL strategy search method, named AutoAL, which is designed on top of existing AL sampling strategies. AutoAL consists of two neural nets, named SearchNet and FitNet, which are optimized concurrently under a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. For any given task, SearchNet and FitNet are iteratively co-optimized using the labeled data, learning how well a set of candidate AL algorithms perform on that task. With the optimal AL strategies identified, SearchNet selects a small subset from the unlabeled pool for querying their annotations, enabling efficient training of the task model. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoAL consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to all candidate AL algorithms and other selective AL approaches, showcasing its potential for adapting and integrating multiple existing AL methods across diverse tasks and domains.

Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism traditionally relies on the softmax operator, necessitating positional embeddings like RoPE, or position biases to account for token order. But current methods using still face length generalisation challenges. We investigate an alternative attention mechanism based on the stick-breaking process in larger scale settings. The method works as follows: For each token before the current, we determine a break point, which represents the proportion of the stick, the weight of the attention, to allocate to the current token. We repeat this on the remaining stick, until all tokens are allocated a weight, resulting in a sequence of attention weights. This process naturally incorporates recency bias, which has linguistic motivations for grammar parsing. We study the implications of replacing the conventional softmax-based attention mechanism with stick-breaking attention. We then discuss implementation of numerically stable stick-breaking attention and adapt Flash Attention to accommodate this mechanism. When used as a drop-in replacement for current softmax+RoPE attention systems, we find that stick-breaking attention performs competitively with current methods on length generalisation and downstream tasks. Stick-breaking also performs well at length generalisation, allowing a model trained with $2^{11}$ context window to perform well at $2^{14}$ with perplexity improvements.

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning models for biological sequences has intensified the need for interpretable predictions, with Shapley values emerging as a theoretically grounded standard for model explanation. While effective for local explanations of individual input sequences, scaling Shapley-based interpretability to extract global biological insights requires evaluating thousands of sequences--incurring exponential computational cost per query. We introduce SHAP zero, a novel algorithm that amortizes the cost of Shapley value computation across large-scale biological datasets. After a one-time model sketching step, SHAP zero enables near-zero marginal cost for future queries by uncovering an underexplored connection between Shapley values, high-order feature interactions, and the sparse Fourier transform of the model. Applied to models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness, SHAP zero explains predictions orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, recovering rich combinatorial interactions previously inaccessible at scale. This work opens the door to principled, efficient, and scalable interpretability for black-box sequence models in biology.

Abstract: The message-passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks (i.e., GCNs) enables label information to be propagated to a broader range of neighbors, thereby increasing the utilization of labels. However, the label information is not always effectively utilized in the traditional GCN framework. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which enables the message passing can effectively utilize label information. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Graph Retention Network as a unified architecture for deep learning on dynamic graphs. The GRN extends the core computational manner of retention to dynamic graph data as graph retention, which empowers the model with three key computational paradigms that enable training parallelism, $O(1)$ low-cost inference, and long-term batch training. This architecture achieves an optimal balance of effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets present the superior performance of the GRN in both edge-level prediction and node-level classification tasks. Our architecture achieves cutting-edge results while maintaining lower training latency, reduced GPU memory consumption, and up to an 86.7x improvement in inference throughput compared to baseline models. The GRNs have demonstrated strong potential to become a widely adopted architecture for dynamic graph learning tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/Chandler-Q/GraphRetentionNet.

Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.

<title>Electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of liver diseases: an externally validated and explainable machine learning approach</title>

Abstract: Background: Liver diseases present a significant global health challenge and often require costly, invasive diagnostics. Electrocardiography (ECG), a widely available and non-invasive tool, can enable the detection of liver disease by capturing cardiovascular-hepatic interactions.
  Methods: We trained tree-based machine learning models on ECG features to detect liver diseases using two large datasets: MIMIC-IV-ECG (467,729 patients, 2008-2019) and ECG-View II (775,535 patients, 1994-2013). The task was framed as binary classification, with performance evaluated via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To improve interpretability, we applied explainability methods to identify key predictive features.
  Findings: The models showed strong predictive performance with good generalizability. For example, AUROCs for alcoholic liver disease (K70) were 0.8025 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8020-0.8035) internally and 0.7644 (95% CI, 0.7641-0.7649) externally; for hepatic failure (K72), scores were 0.7404 (95% CI, 0.7389-0.7415) and 0.7498 (95% CI, 0.7494-0.7509), respectively. The explainability analysis consistently identified age and prolonged QTc intervals (corrected QT, reflecting ventricular repolarization) as key predictors. Features linked to autonomic regulation and electrical conduction abnormalities were also prominent, supporting known cardiovascular-liver connections and suggesting QTc as a potential biomarker.
  Interpretation: ECG-based machine learning offers a promising, interpretable approach for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited settings. By revealing clinically relevant biomarkers, this method supports non-invasive diagnostics, early detection, and risk stratification prior to targeted clinical assessments.

<title>Uplift modeling with continuous treatments: A predict-then-optimize approach</title>

Abstract: The goal of uplift modeling is to recommend actions that optimize specific outcomes by determining which entities should receive treatment. One common approach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step that ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top k within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary treatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued treatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize framework to allow for continuous treatments in uplift modeling. First, in the inference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from data using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization step, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a dose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP). This approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate treatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of adding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective function to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize utility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the trade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an adapted objective function. This showcases the framework's advantages and flexibility across diverse applications in healthcare, lending, and human resource management. All code is available on github.com/SimonDeVos/UMCT.

Abstract: To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.

Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.

Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.

Abstract: Intelligent agents are able to make decisions based on different levels of granularity and duration. Recent advances in skill learning enabled the agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by effectively guiding the agent in choosing appropriate skills. However, the practice of using fixed-length skills can easily result in skipping valuable decision points, which ultimately limits the potential for further exploration and faster policy learning. In this work, we propose to learn a simple and effective termination condition that identifies decision points through a state-action novelty module that leverages agent experience data. Our approach, Novelty-based Decision Point Identification (NBDI), outperforms previous baselines in complex, long-horizon tasks, and remains effective even in the presence of significant variations in the environment configurations of downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of decision point identification in skill learning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting methods generally fall into two main categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies. While CI overlooks important covariate relationships, CD captures all dependencies without distinction, introducing noise and reducing generalization. Recent advances in Channel Clustering (CC) aim to refine dependency modeling by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying tailored modeling techniques. However, coarse-grained clustering struggles to capture complex, time-varying interactions effectively. To address these challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a GNN-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. After constructing the graph from the input sequence, TimeFilter refines the learned spatial-temporal dependencies by filtering out irrelevant correlations while preserving the most critical ones in a patch-specific manner. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeFilter.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text-to-image models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in the general setting of nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, their ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.

Abstract: Gradient-based Discrete Samplers (GDSs) are effective for sampling discrete energy landscapes. However, they often stagnate in complex, non-convex settings. To improve exploration, we introduce the Discrete Replica EXchangE Langevin (DREXEL) sampler and its variant with Adjusted Metropolis (DREAM). These samplers use two GDSs at different temperatures and step sizes: one focuses on local exploitation, while the other explores broader energy landscapes. When energy differences are significant, sample swaps occur, which are determined by a mechanism tailored for discrete sampling to ensure detailed balance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed samplers satisfy detailed balance and converge to the target distribution under mild conditions. Experiments across 2d synthetic simulations, sampling from Ising models and restricted Boltzmann machines, and training deep energy-based models further confirm their efficiency in exploring non-convex discrete energy landscapes.

Abstract: Transformer-based models demonstrate a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a few prompt examples without parameter updates. Notably, recent research has provided insight into how the Transformer architecture can perform ICL, showing that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent for linear least-squares objectives when trained on random linear regression tasks.
  Building upon this understanding of linear ICL, we investigate ICL for nonlinear function classes. We first show that LSA is inherently incapable of solving problems that go beyond linear least-squares objectives, underscoring why prior solutions cannot readily extend to nonlinear ICL tasks. To overcome this limitation, we investigate a mechanism combining LSA with feed-forward layers that are inspired by the gated linear units (GLU) commonly found in modern Transformer architectures. We show that this combination empowers the Transformer to perform nonlinear ICL, specifically by implementing one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression loss. Furthermore, we show that multiple blocks of our GLU-LSA model implement block coordinate descent in this polynomial kernel space. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of attention and feed-forward layers, demonstrating that the feed-forward components provide a mechanism by which Transformers gain nonlinear capabilities for ICL.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specified data from a trained model. While metrics such as unlearning accuracy (UA) and membership inference attack (MIA) provide baselines for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the forgetting reliability. In this paper, we find that the data misclassified across UA and MIA still have their ground truth labels included in the prediction set from the uncertainty quantification perspective, which raises a fake unlearning issue. To address this issue, we propose two novel metrics inspired by conformal prediction that more reliably evaluate forgetting quality. Building on these insights, we further propose a conformal prediction-based unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss, which can significantly push the ground truth label out of the conformal prediction set. Through extensive experiments on image classification task, we demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and the superiority of our unlearning framework, which improves the UA of existing unlearning methods by an average of 6.6% through the incorporation of a tailored loss term alone.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes 10 homophilic datasets, 4 heterophilic datasets, 8 LLM-based algorithms, 8 classic baselines, and 3 learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,700 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size and prompt) that affect performance. Our findings uncover 8 insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field. Codes and datasets are released at \href{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}{\texttt{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}}.

<title>The Differences Between Direct Alignment Algorithms are a Blur</title>

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) offer a simpler way to language model alignment than traditional RLHF by directly optimizing policies. While DAAs differ in their use of SFT (one-stage vs. two-stage), the scalar scores within their objectives (likelihood vs. odds ratios), and ranking objectives (pairwise vs. pointwise), the critical factors for performance remain underexplored. We provide a systematic comparative analysis. We first show that one-stage methods (e.g. ORPO, ASFT) underperform compared to two-stage approaches. However, we demonstrate that adapting them to a two-stage setup with an explicit SFT phase can improve their performance. Further, introducing and tuning a unifying $\beta$ parameter within this two-stage framework boosts their performence (e.g., AlpacaEval 2: $+13.45$ ORPO, $+8.27$ ASFT), matching established methods like DPO and enabling fair comparisons. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that the choice between pairwise and pointwise objectives is the primary determinant of alignment success, rather than the specific scalar score (e.g., policy-reference ratio vs. odds ratio) employed. We provide empirical evidence suggesting this stems from how these objectives interact with prompt-specific biases. These findings underscore the need for nuanced evaluations in DAA research to avoid oversimplified claims of superiority.

Abstract: Circuit representation learning has become pivotal in electronic design automation, enabling critical tasks such as testability analysis, logic reasoning, power estimation, and SAT solving. However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.
  In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.

<title>Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm that minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.
  More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate the performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we introduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that computes the minimum total inference latency under full future information. Second, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by the computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we propose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under certain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also demonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the hindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical evaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the Llama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

Abstract: Conditional expectation \mathbb{E}(Y \mid X) often fails to capture the complexity of multimodal conditional distributions \mathcal{L}(Y \mid X). To address this, we propose using n-point conditional quantizations--functional mappings of X that are learnable via gradient descent--to approximate \mathcal{L}(Y \mid X). This approach adapts Competitive Learning Vector Quantization (CLVQ), tailored for conditional distributions. It goes beyond single-valued predictions by providing multiple representative points that better reflect multimodal structures. It enables the approximation of the true conditional law in the Wasserstein distance. The resulting framework is theoretically grounded and useful for uncertainty quantification and multimodal data generation tasks. For example, in computer vision inpainting tasks, multiple plausible reconstructions may exist for the same partially observed input image X. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Early prediction of pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) is critical for timely intervention in high-risk intensive care settings. We introduce PedCA-FT, a novel transformer-based framework that fuses tabular view of EHR with the derived textual view of EHR to fully unleash the interactions of high-dimensional risk factors and their dynamics. By employing dedicated transformer modules for each modality view, PedCA-FT captures complex temporal and contextual patterns to produce robust CA risk estimates. Evaluated on a curated pediatric cohort from the CHOA-CICU database, our approach outperforms ten other artificial intelligence models across five key performance metrics and identifies clinically meaningful risk factors. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal fusion techniques to enhance early CA detection and improve patient care.

<title>LDC-MTL: Balancing Multi-Task Learning through Scalable Loss Discrepancy Control</title>

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely adopted for its ability to simultaneously learn multiple tasks. While existing gradient manipulation methods often yield more balanced solutions than simple scalarization-based approaches, they typically incur a significant computational overhead of $\mathcal{O}(K)$ in both time and memory, where $K$ is the number of tasks. In this paper, we propose LDC-MTL, a simple and scalable loss discrepancy control approach for MTL, formulated from a bilevel optimization perspective. Our method incorporates three key components: (i) a coarse loss pre-normalization, (ii) a bilevel formulation for fine-grained loss discrepancy control, and (iii) a scalable first-order bilevel algorithm that requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and memory. Theoretically, we prove that LDC-MTL guarantees convergence not only to a stationary point of the bilevel problem with loss discrepancy control but also to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point for all $K$ loss functions under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-task datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LDC-MTL in both accuracy and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/LDC-MTL.

<title>Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion</title>

Abstract: In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.

Abstract: The open-world assumption in model development suggests that a model might lack sufficient information to adequately handle data that is entirely distinct or out of distribution (OOD). While deep learning methods have shown promising results in handling OOD data through generalization techniques, they often require specialized hardware that may not be accessible to all users. We present TCL, a lightweight yet effective solution that operates efficiently on standard CPU hardware. Our approach adapts contrastive learning principles specifically for tabular data structures, incorporating full matrix augmentation and simplified loss calculation. Through comprehensive experiments across 10 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that TCL outperforms existing models, including FT-Transformer and ResNet, particularly in classification tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in regression problems. TCL achieves these results with significantly reduced computational requirements, making it accessible to users with limited hardware capabilities. This study also provides practical guidance for detecting and evaluating OOD data through straightforward experiments and visualizations. Our findings show that TCL offers a promising balance between performance and efficiency in handling OOD prediction tasks, which is particularly beneficial for general machine learning practitioners working with computational constraints.

Abstract: The full-size MLPs and the projection layers in attention introduce tremendous model sizes of large language models (LLMs), imposing extremely demanding needs of computational resources in the pre-training stage. However, we empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: World model (WM) agents enable sample-efficient reinforcement learning by learning policies entirely from simulated experience. However, existing token-based world models (TBWMs) are limited to visual inputs and discrete actions, restricting their adoption and applicability. Moreover, although both intrinsic motivation and prioritized WM replay have shown promise in improving WM performance and generalization, they remain underexplored in this setting, particularly in combination. We introduce Simulus, a highly modular TBWM agent that integrates (1) a modular multi-modality tokenization framework, (2) intrinsic motivation, (3) prioritized WM replay, and (4) regression-as-classification for reward and return prediction. Simulus achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency for planning-free WMs across three diverse benchmarks. Ablation studies reveal the individual contribution of each component while highlighting their synergy. Our code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/leor-c/Simulus.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: do LLMs truly understand program execution semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's understanding of code execution semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. The transformations span syntactic edits, structural modifications, and algorithmic changes, covering a broad spectrum of semantic variation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning over execution semantics, highlighting fundamental limitations.

Abstract: The proliferation of text-to-image diffusion models has raised significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the generation of copyrighted or harmful images. In response, several concept erasure (defense) methods have been developed to prevent the generation of unwanted content through post-hoc finetuning. On the other hand, concept restoration (attack) methods seek to recover supposedly erased concepts via adversarially crafted prompts. However, all existing restoration methods only succeed in the highly restrictive scenario of finding adversarial prompts tailed to some fixed seed. To address this, we introduce RECORD, a novel coordinate-descent-based restoration algorithm that finds adversarial prompts to recover erased concepts independently of the seed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate RECORD consistently outperforms the current restoration methods by up to 17.8 times in this setting. Our findings further reveal the susceptibility of unlearned models to restoration attacks, providing crucial insights into the behavior of unlearned models under the influence of adversarial prompts.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL) with each task involving graph-dependent data, existing generalization analyses yield a \emph{sub-optimal} risk bound of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, where $n$ is the number of training samples of each task. However, to improve the risk bound is technically challenging, which is attributed to the lack of a foundational sharper concentration inequality for multi-graph dependent random variables. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes a new Bennett-type inequality, enabling the derivation of a sharper risk bound of $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$. Technically, building on the proposed Bennett-type inequality, we propose a new Talagrand-type inequality for the empirical process, and further develop a new analytical framework of the local fractional Rademacher complexity to enhance generalization analyses in MTL with multi-graph dependent data. Finally, we apply the theoretical advancements to applications such as Macro-AUC optimization, illustrating the superiority of our theoretical results over prior work, which is also verified by experimental results.

Abstract: Digital soil mapping (DSM) relies on a broad pool of statistical methods, yet determining the optimal method for a given context remains challenging and contentious. Benchmarking studies on multiple datasets are needed to reveal strengths and limitations of commonly used methods. Existing DSM studies usually rely on a single dataset with restricted access, leading to incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. To address these issues, we introduce an open-access dataset collection called Precision Liming Soil Datasets (LimeSoDa). LimeSoDa consists of 31 field- and farm-scale datasets from various countries. Each dataset has three target soil properties: (1) soil organic matter or soil organic carbon, (2) clay content and (3) pH, alongside a set of features. Features are dataset-specific and were obtained by optical spectroscopy, proximal- and remote soil sensing. All datasets were aligned to a tabular format and are ready-to-use for modeling. We demonstrated the use of LimeSoDa for benchmarking by comparing the predictive performance of four learning algorithms across all datasets. This comparison included multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), categorical boosting (CatBoost) and random forest (RF). The results showed that although no single algorithm was universally superior, certain algorithms performed better in specific contexts. MLR and SVR performed better on high-dimensional spectral datasets, likely due to better compatibility with principal components. In contrast, CatBoost and RF exhibited considerably better performances when applied to datasets with a moderate number (< 20) of features. These benchmarking results illustrate that the performance of a method is highly context-dependent. LimeSoDa therefore provides an important resource for improving the development and evaluation of statistical methods in DSM.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the performance of distributed learning systems, i.e., one-round Federated Learning, as measured by the associated generalization error. Specifically, $K$ clients have each $n$ training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution, and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound, which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., $K=1$, to the distributed learning setting with an arbitrary number of clients $K \geq 1$. Then, we connect with information-theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for the distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (DSVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds that depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients increases, thereby suggesting that DSVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond DSVM, is validated experimentally through several experiments.

Abstract: Distribution shift poses a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in biomedical applications using data collected across different subjects, institutions, and recording devices, such as sleep data. While existing normalization layers, BatchNorm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help mitigate distribution shifts, when applied over the time dimension they ignore the dependencies and auto-correlation inherent to the vector coefficients they normalize. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models for signals. Notably, the proposed method operates as a test-time domain adaptation technique, addressing distribution shifts without additional training. Evaluations with architectures based on U-Net or transformer backbones trained on 10K subjects across 10 datasets, show that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen left-out datasets while being 4-times more data-efficient than BatchNorm.

Abstract: This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
  Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.

Abstract: The problem of relevant and diverse subset selection has a wide range of applications, including recommender systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For example, in recommender systems, one is interested in selecting relevant items, while providing a diversified recommendation. Constrained subset selection problem is NP-hard, and popular approaches such as Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) are based on greedy selection. Many real-world applications involve large data, but the original MMR work did not consider distributed selection. This limitation was later addressed by a method called DGDS which allows for a distributed setting using random data partitioning. Here, we exploit structure in the data to further improve both scalability and performance on the target application. We propose MUSS, a novel method that uses a multilevel approach to relevant and diverse selection. In a recommender system application, our method can not only improve the performance up to $4$ percent points in precision, but is also $20$ to $80$ times faster. Our method is also capable of outperforming baselines on RAG-based question answering accuracy. We present a novel theoretical approach for analyzing this type of problems, and show that our method achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal objective. Moreover, our analysis also resulted in a $\times 2$ tighter bound for DGDS compared to previously known bound.

Abstract: Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through dynamic retrieval strategies and reinforcement fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex reasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques: Policy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use of retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS), which dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual needs. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as a lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without requiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive tasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a novel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance, mitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also incorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning depth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for faster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework reduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves significant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This integrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable RAG systems across diverse applications.

Abstract: We propose a scalable, approximate inference hypernetwork framework for a general model of history-dependent processes. The flexible data model is based on a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) representing the evolution of internal states together with a trainable observation model subcomponent. The posterior distribution corresponding to the data model parameters (weights and biases) follows a stochastic differential equation with a drift term related to the score of the posterior that is learned jointly with the data model parameters. This Langevin sampling approach offers flexibility in balancing the computational budget between the evaluation cost of the data model and the approximation of the posterior density of its parameters. We demonstrate performance of the ensemble sampling hypernetwork on chemical reaction and material physics data and compare it to standard variational inference.

<title>Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{LUFFY} (\textbf{L}earning to reason \textbf{U}nder o\textbf{FF}-polic\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.

Abstract: Cosine similarity has become a standard metric for comparing embeddings in modern machine learning. Its scale-invariance and alignment with model training objectives have contributed to its widespread adoption. However, recent studies have revealed important limitations, particularly when embedding norms carry meaningful semantic information. This informal article offers a reflective and selective examination of the evolution, strengths, and limitations of cosine similarity. We highlight why it performs well in many settings, where it tends to break down, and how emerging alternatives are beginning to address its blind spots. We hope to offer a mix of conceptual clarity and practical perspective, especially for quantitative scientists who think about embeddings not just as vectors, but as geometric and philosophical objects.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.

Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

Abstract: Roaming in Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning junta distributions on $\{0, 1\}^n$, where a distribution is a $k$-junta if its probability mass function depends on a subset of at most $k$ variables. We make two main contributions:
  - We show that learning $k$-junta distributions is \emph{computationally} equivalent to learning $k$-parity functions with noise (LPN), a landmark problem in computational learning theory.
  - We design an algorithm for learning junta distributions whose statistical complexity is optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors. Computationally, our algorithm matches the complexity of previous (non-sample-optimal) algorithms.
  Combined, our two contributions imply that our algorithm cannot be significantly improved, statistically or computationally, barring a breakthrough for LPN.

Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage and thus enables more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples on widely used open datasets. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance explainability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the gap between the training and testing losses.

Abstract: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000 sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8 steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a 675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps. Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at 250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available at: https://github.com/LINs-lab/UCGM.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Practical Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is challenged by noise, limited scalability, and poor trainability in Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) on current hardware. We propose a multi-chip ensemble VQC framework that systematically overcomes these hurdles. By partitioning high-dimensional computations across ensembles of smaller, independently operating quantum chips and leveraging controlled inter-chip entanglement boundaries, our approach demonstrably mitigates barren plateaus, enhances generalization, and uniquely reduces both quantum error bias and variance simultaneously without additional mitigation overhead. This allows for robust processing of large-scale data, as validated on standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) and a real-world PhysioNet EEG dataset, aligning with emerging modular quantum hardware and paving the way for more scalable QML.

Abstract: Independence testing is a classical statistical problem that has been extensively studied in the batch setting when one fixes the sample size before collecting data. However, practitioners often prefer procedures that adapt to the complexity of a problem at hand instead of setting sample size in advance. Ideally, such procedures should (a) stop earlier on easy tasks (and later on harder tasks), hence making better use of available resources, and (b) continuously monitor the data and efficiently incorporate statistical evidence after collecting new data, while controlling the false alarm rate. Classical batch tests are not tailored for streaming data: valid inference after data peeking requires correcting for multiple testing which results in low power. Following the principle of testing by betting, we design sequential kernelized independence tests that overcome such shortcomings. We exemplify our broad framework using bets inspired by kernelized dependence measures, e.g., the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. Our test is also valid under non-i.i.d., time-varying settings. We demonstrate the power of our approaches on both simulated and real data.

Abstract: Many recent theoretical works on \emph{meta-learning} aim to achieve guarantees in leveraging similar representational structures from related tasks towards simplifying a target task. The main aim of theoretical guarantees on the subject is to establish the extent to which convergence rates -- in learning a common representation -- \emph{may scale with the number $N$ of tasks} (as well as the number of samples per task). First steps in this setting demonstrate this property when both the shared representation amongst tasks, and task-specific regression functions, are linear. This linear setting readily reveals the benefits of aggregating tasks, e.g., via averaging arguments. In practice, however, the representation is often highly nonlinear, introducing nontrivial biases in each task that cannot easily be averaged out as in the linear case. In the present work, we derive theoretical guarantees for meta-learning with nonlinear representations. In particular, assuming the shared nonlinearity maps to an infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we show that additional biases can be mitigated with careful regularization that leverages the smoothness of task-specific regression functions, yielding improved rates that scale with the number of tasks as desired.

Abstract: Empathy indicates an individual's ability to understand others. Over the past few years, empathy has drawn attention from various disciplines, including but not limited to Affective Computing, Cognitive Science, and Psychology. Detecting empathy has potential applications in society, healthcare and education. Despite being a broad and overlapping topic, the avenue of empathy detection leveraging Machine Learning remains underexplored from a systematic literature review perspective. We collected 849 papers from 10 well-known academic databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 82 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations - including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion - in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities - text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals - thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. This paper, therefore, provides a structured overview of recent advancements and remaining challenges towards developing a robust empathy detection system that could meaningfully contribute to enhancing human well-being.

Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.

Recent research has shown that designing AI agents that take human behavior into account leads to improved performance in human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is their assumption that human behavior remains static, regardless of the AI agent's actions. In reality, humans may adjust their actions based on their beliefs about the AI's intentions, specifically, the subtasks they perceive the AI to be attempting to complete based on its behavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative AI agent to consider its human partner's beliefs about its intentions, i.e., what the human partner thinks the AI agent is trying to accomplish, and to design its action plan accordingly to facilitate more effective human-AI collaboration. Specifically, we developed a model of human beliefs that captures how humans interpret and reason about their AI partner's intentions. Using this belief model, we created an AI agent that incorporates both human behavior and human beliefs when devising its strategy for interacting with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject experiments, we demonstrate that our belief model more accurately captures human perceptions of AI intentions. Furthermore, we show that our AI agent, designed to account for human beliefs over its intentions, significantly enhances performance in human-AI collaboration.

<title>FedEx: Expediting Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices by Overlapping and Participant Selection</title>

Abstract: Training latency is critical for the success of numerous intrigued applications ignited by federated learning (FL) over heterogeneous mobile devices. By revolutionarily overlapping local gradient transmission with continuous local computing, FL can remarkably reduce its training latency over homogeneous clients, yet encounter severe model staleness, model drifts, memory cost and straggler issues in heterogeneous environments. To unleash the full potential of overlapping, we propose, FedEx, a novel \underline{fed}erated learning approach to \underline{ex}pedite FL training over mobile devices under data, computing and wireless heterogeneity. FedEx redefines the overlapping procedure with staleness ceilings to constrain memory consumption and make overlapping compatible with participation selection (PS) designs. Then, FedEx characterizes the PS utility function by considering the latency reduced by overlapping, and provides a holistic PS solution to address the straggler issue. FedEx also introduces a simple but effective metric to trigger overlapping, in order to avoid model drifts. Experimental results show that compared with its peer designs, FedEx demonstrates substantial reductions in FL training latency over heterogeneous mobile devices with limited memory cost.

<title>From Theft to Bomb-Making: The Ripple Effect of Unlearning in Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02855</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Consequently, unlearning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate jailbreak attacks by directly removing harmful knowledge from the model. In this paper, we identify a novel ripple effect of unlearning, wherein LLMs can implicitly unlearn harmful knowledge that was not explicitly introduced during the unlearning phase (e.g., a model unlearning the steps for theft may also implicitly unlearn the steps for making a bomb). Through over 100 experimental runs spanning multiple models, attack strategies, and defense methods, we empirically validate this phenomenon, which makes unlearning-based methods able to decrease the Attack Success Rate on unseen data from more than 70% to less than 10% with only 100 training samples. Further analysis reveals that the strong generalization ability of unlearning may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM). We also discuss the potential limitations of unlearning and the observed ripple effect. We hope our research could contribute to a deeper understanding of unlearning. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SafeUnlearning.

Abstract: Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) and tactile sensing has significantly advanced dexterous manipulation. However, these methods often utilize simplified tactile signals due to the gap between tactile simulation and the real world. We introduce a sensor model for tactile skin that enables zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of ternary shear and binary normal forces. Using this model, we develop an RL policy that leverages sliding contact for dexterous in-hand translation. We conduct extensive real-world experiments to assess how tactile sensing facilitates policy adaptation to various unseen object properties and robot hand orientations. We demonstrate that our 3-axis tactile policies consistently outperform baselines that use only shear forces, only normal forces, or only proprioception.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of continual distillation learning (CDL) in order to use knowledge distillation (KD) to improve prompt-based continual learning (CL) models. The CDL problem is valuable to study since the use of a larger vision transformer (ViT) leads to better performance in prompt-based continual learning. The distillation of knowledge from a large ViT to a small ViT improves the inference efficiency for prompt-based CL models. We empirically found that existing KD methods such as logit distillation and feature distillation cannot effectively improve the student model in the CDL setup. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method named Knowledge Distillation based on Prompts (KDP), in which globally accessible prompts specifically designed for knowledge distillation are inserted into the frozen ViT backbone of the student model. We demonstrate that our KDP method effectively enhances the distillation performance in comparison to existing KD methods in the CDL setup.

Abstract: Persona agents, which are LLM agents conditioned to act according to an assigned persona, enable contextually rich and user aligned interactions across domains like education and healthcare. However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.

Abstract: We consider a moving target that we seek to learn from samples. Our results extend randomized techniques developed in control and optimization for a constant target to the case where the target is changing. We derive a novel bound on the number of samples that are required to construct a probably approximately correct (PAC) estimate of the target. Furthermore, when the moving target is a convex polytope, we provide a constructive method of generating the PAC estimate using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The proposed method is demonstrated on an application to autonomous emergency braking.

Abstract: We present aTENNuate, a simple deep state-space autoencoder configured for efficient online raw speech enhancement in an end-to-end fashion. The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We evaluate three popular EO foundation models, SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, on five crop classification datasets across five continents. Results show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. While only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to mitigate class imbalance and improve average accuracy.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects around 50 million people globally. Electroencephalography (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based spike detection plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training that further limits the number of qualified professionals. To ease the difficulty, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, the existing methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where the spikes originate. A novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework is proposed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL is shown to improve prediction accuracy, achieve channel localization, support cross-modality data integration, and adapt to various neurophysiological applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to analyze the inference patterns used by Large Language Models (LLMs) for judgment in a case study on legal LLMs, so as to identify potential incorrect representations of the LLM, according to human domain knowledge. Unlike traditional evaluations on language generation results, we propose to evaluate the correctness of the detailed inference patterns of an LLM behind its seemingly correct outputs. To this end, we quantify the interactions between input phrases used by the LLM as primitive inference patterns, because recent theoretical achievements have proven several mathematical guarantees of the faithfulness of the interaction-based explanation. We design a set of metrics to evaluate the detailed inference patterns of LLMs. Experiments show that even when the language generation results appear correct, a significant portion of the inference patterns used by the LLM for the legal judgment may represent misleading or irrelevant logic.

Abstract: The recently introduced path-star task is a minimal task designed to exemplify limitations to the abilities of language models (Bachmann and Nagarajan, 2024). It involves a path-star graph where multiple arms radiate from a single starting node and each node is unique. Given the start node and a specified target node that ends an arm, the task is to generate the arm containing that target node. This is straightforward for a human but surprisingly difficult for language models, which did not outperform the random baseline. The authors hypothesized this is due to a deficiency in teacher-forcing and the next-token prediction paradigm.
  We demonstrate the task is learnable using teacher-forcing in alternative settings and that the issue is partially due to representation. We introduce a regularization method using structured samples of the same graph but with differing target nodes, improving results across a variety of model types. We provide RASP proofs showing the task is theoretically solvable. Finally, we find settings where an encoder-only model can consistently solve the task.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have driven the state-of-the-art performance of LLMs today by enabling the integration of human feedback into the language modeling process. However, RMs are primarily trained and evaluated in English, and their capabilities in multilingual settings remain largely understudied. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of several reward models in multilingual settings. We first construct the first-of-its-kind multilingual RM evaluation benchmark, M-RewardBench, consisting of 2.87k preference instances for 23 typologically diverse languages, that tests the chat, safety, reasoning, and translation capabilities of RMs. We then rigorously evaluate a wide range of reward models on M-RewardBench, offering fresh insights into their performance across diverse languages. We identify a significant gap in RMs' performances between English and non-English languages and show that RM preferences can change substantially from one language to another. We also present several findings on how different multilingual aspects impact RM performance. Specifically, we show that the performance of RMs is improved with improved translation quality. Similarly, we demonstrate that the models exhibit better performance for high-resource languages. We release M-RewardBench dataset and the codebase in this study to facilitate a better understanding of RM evaluation in multilingual settings.

Abstract: We present Unified Microphone Conversion, a unified generative framework designed to bolster sound event classification (SEC) systems against device variability. While our prior CycleGAN-based methods effectively simulate device characteristics, they require separate models for each device pair, limiting scalability. Our approach overcomes this constraint by conditioning the generator on frequency response data, enabling many-to-many device mappings through unpaired training. We integrate frequency-response information via Feature-wise Linear Modulation, further enhancing scalability. Additionally, incorporating synthetic frequency response differences improves the applicability of our framework for real-world application. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.6% and reduces variability by 0.8% in macro-average F1 score.

Abstract: Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.

Abstract: Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.

Abstract: Imitation learning in robotics faces significant challenges in generalization due to the complexity of robotic environments and the high cost of data collection. We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of invariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance data augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by modifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting the policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying rigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions to generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive experiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in policy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust generalization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of distractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping, indicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task dynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA provides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning, bridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design. Source code will be available at https://github.com/Ced3-han/PepHAR.

Abstract: In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning (ML) models in their systems. Ideally, ML models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up-to-date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource-intensive, costly, time-consuming, and model-dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity-Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent data distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent data distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent unnecessary retrainings. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on five time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the models' performance while significantly reducing maintenance time, costs, and the number of retrainings. Our model reuse approach achieves ML model performance comparable to the best baselines, while reducing the computation time and costs to 1/8th. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain their ML models' performance in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance time and costs.

Abstract: As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.

We introduce Subspace Langevin Monte Carlo (SLMC), a novel and efficient sampling method that generalizes random-coordinate Langevin Monte Carlo and preconditioned Langevin Monte Carlo by projecting the Langevin update onto subsampled eigenblocks of a time-varying preconditioner at each iteration. The advantage of SLMC is its superior adaptability and computational efficiency compared to traditional Langevin Monte Carlo and preconditioned Langevin Monte Carlo. Using coupling arguments, we establish error guarantees for SLMC and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through a few experiments on sampling from ill-conditioned distributions.

Abstract: Adaptive bandwidth selection is a fundamental challenge in nonparametric regression. This paper introduces a new bandwidth selection procedure inspired by the optimality criteria for $\ell_0$-penalized regression. Although similar in spirit to Lepski's method and its variants in selecting the largest interval satisfying an admissibility criterion, our approach stems from a distinct philosophy, utilizing criteria based on $\ell_2$-norms of interval projections rather than explicit point and variance estimates. We obtain non-asymptotic risk bounds for the local polynomial regression methods based on our bandwidth selection procedure which adapt (near-)optimally to the local H\"{o}lder exponent of the underlying regression function simultaneously at all points in its domain. Furthermore, we show that there is a single ideal choice of a global tuning parameter in each case under which the above-mentioned local adaptivity holds. The optimal risks of our methods derive from the properties of solutions to a new ``bandwidth selection equation'' which is of independent interest. We believe that the principles underlying our approach provide a new perspective to the classical yet ever relevant problem of locally adaptive nonparametric regression.

<title>Self-Supervised Frameworks for Speaker Verification via Bootstrapped Positive Sampling</title>

Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Standard SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs extracted from the same audio utterances. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, under the assumption that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method demonstrates consistent improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when implemented in major SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR, and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.

Abstract: With the rapid growth in the number of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a recent interest in LLM routing, or directing queries to the cheapest LLM that can deliver a suitable response. We conduct a minimax analysis of the routing problem, providing a lower bound and finding that a simple router that predicts both cost and accuracy for each question can be minimax optimal. Inspired by this, we introduce CARROT, a Cost AwaRe Rate Optimal rouTer that selects a model based on estimates of the models' cost and performance. Alongside CARROT, we also introduce the Smart Price-aware ROUTing (SPROUT) dataset to facilitate routing on a wide spectrum of queries with the latest state-of-the-art LLMs. Using SPROUT and prior benchmarks such as Routerbench and open-LLM-leaderboard-v2 we empirically validate CARROT's performance against several alternative routers.

<title>Does Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Improve the Robustness of Amortized Bayesian Inference? A Systematic Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Neural networks are fragile when confronted with data that significantly deviates from their training distribution. This is true in particular for simulation-based inference methods, such as neural amortized Bayesian inference (ABI), where models trained on simulated data are deployed on noisy real-world observations. Recent robust approaches employ unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to match the embedding spaces of simulated and observed data. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluations across different domain mismatches raises concerns about the reliability in high-stakes applications. We address this gap by systematically testing UDA approaches across a wide range of misspecification scenarios in silico and practice. We demonstrate that aligning summary spaces between domains effectively mitigates the impact of unmodeled phenomena or noise. However, the same alignment mechanism can lead to failures under prior misspecifications - a critical finding with practical consequences. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of misspecification types when using UDA to increase the robustness of ABI.

arXiv:2502.09790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage multi-source training by combining high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope with TESS data. This approach mitigates the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalog containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.

Abstract: Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While LMMs have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both SFT and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

<title>Re-Align: Aligning Vision Language Models via Retrieval-Augmented Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications. We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now achieve near-human performance on standard math word problem benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K), yet their true reasoning ability remains disputed. A key concern is that models often produce confident, yet unfounded, answers to unanswerable problems. We introduce TreeCut, a synthetic dataset that systematically generates infinite unanswerable math word problems and their answerable counterparts, by representing each question as a tree and removing chosen necessary conditions. Experiments show TreeCut effectively induce hallucinations in large language models, including GPT-4o and o3-mini, with rates of 64% and 44% in their respective worst-case scenarios under zero-shot setting. Further analysis highlights that deeper or more complex trees, composite item names, and removing necessary condition near the middle of a path all increase the likelihood of hallucinations, underscoring the persistent challenges LLMs face in identifying unanswerable math problems. The dataset generation code and sample data are available at https://github.com/j-bagel/treecut-math.

Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose three new decoding methods that leverage a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. Experiments concerning math problem solving, extreme summarization, and the divergent association task demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least as well as existing methods in terms of quality and diversity.

Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.

Abstract: Adversarial approaches, which intentionally challenge machine learning models by generating difficult examples, are increasingly being adopted to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.

Abstract: While gradient-based discrete samplers are effective in sampling from complex distributions, they are susceptible to getting trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional, multimodal discrete distributions, owing to the discontinuities inherent in these landscapes. To circumvent this issue, we combine parallel tempering, also known as replica exchange, with the discrete Langevin proposal and develop the Parallel Tempering enhanced Discrete Langevin Proposal (PTDLP), which are simulated at a series of temperatures. Significant energy differences prompt sample swaps, which are governed by a Metropolis criterion specifically designed for discrete sampling to ensure detailed balance is maintained. Additionally, we introduce an automatic scheme to determine the optimal temperature schedule and the number of chains, ensuring adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal tuning. Theoretically, we establish that our algorithm converges non-asymptotically to the target energy and exhibits faster mixing compared to a single chain. Empirical results further emphasize the superiority of our method in sampling from complex, multimodal discrete distributions, including synthetic problems, restricted Boltzmann machines, and deep energy-based models.

<title>Erasing Without Remembering: Implicit Knowledge Forgetting in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate knowledge forgetting in large language models with a focus on its generalisation--ensuring that models forget not only specific training samples but also related implicit knowledge. To this end, we begin by identifying a broader unlearning scope that includes both target data and logically associated samples, including rephrased, subject-replaced, one-hop reasoned, and relation-reversed data. To rigorously evaluate generalisation, we introduce UGBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess the unlearning of in-scope implicit knowledge covering 13 state-of-the-art methods across three datasets. UGBench reveals that unlearned models can still recall paraphrased answers and retain target facts in intermediate layers. This motivates us to take a preliminary step toward more generalised implicit knowledge forgetting by proposing PerMU, a novel probability perturbation-based unlearning paradigm. PerMU simulates adversarial unlearning samples to eliminate fact-related tokens from the logit distribution, collectively reducing the probabilities of all answer-associated tokens. Experiments are conducted on a diverse range of datasets, including TOFU, Harry Potter, ZsRE, WMDP, and MUSE, using models ranging from 1.3B to 13B in scale. The results demonstrate that PerMU delivers up to a 50.40% improvement in unlearning vanilla target data while maintaining a 40.73% boost in forgetting implicit knowledge. Our code can be found in https://github.com/MaybeLizzy/UGBench.

Abstract: Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a widely adopted strategy for reducing the computational cost of attention layers in large language models (LLMs). However, current GQA configurations are often suboptimal because they overlook how context length influences inference cost. Since inference cost grows with context length, the most cost-efficient GQA configuration should also vary accordingly. In this work, we analyze the relationship among context length, model size, GQA configuration, and model loss, and introduce two innovations: (1) we decouple the total head size from the hidden size, enabling more flexible control over attention FLOPs; and (2) we jointly optimize the model size and the GQA configuration to arrive at a better allocation of inference resources between attention layers and other components. Our analysis reveals that commonly used GQA configurations are highly suboptimal for long-context scenarios. More importantly, we propose a recipe for deriving cost-optimal GQA configurations. Our results show that for long-context scenarios, one should use fewer attention heads while scaling up model size. Configurations selected by our recipe can reduce both memory usage and FLOPs by more than 50% compared to Llama-3's GQA, with *no degradation in model capabilities*. Our findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient long-context LLMs. The code is available at https://www.github.com/THUNLP/cost-optimal-gqa .

Abstract: Text-to-Image diffusion models can produce undesirable content that necessitates concept erasure. However, existing methods struggle with under-erasure, leaving residual traces of targeted concepts, or over-erasure, mistakenly eliminating unrelated but visually similar concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce CRCE, a novel concept erasure framework that leverages Large Language Models to identify both semantically related concepts that should be erased alongside the target and distinct concepts that should be preserved. By explicitly modelling coreferential and retained concepts semantically, CRCE enables more precise concept removal, without unintended erasure. Experiments demonstrate that CRCE outperforms existing methods on diverse erasure tasks, including real-world object, person identities, and abstract intellectual property characteristics. The constructed dataset CorefConcept and the source code will be release upon acceptance.

Abstract: Limited large-scale evaluations exist for facilitation strategies of online discussions due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple, generalizable, LLM-driven methodology to prototype the development of LLM facilitators, and produce high-quality synthetic data without human involvement. We use our methodology to test whether current facilitation strategies can improve the performance of LLM facilitators. We find that, while LLM facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence that the application of more elaborate facilitation strategies proposed in modern Social Science research lead to further improvements in discussion quality, compared to more basic approaches. Additionally, we find that small LLMs (such as Mistral Nemo 12B) can perform comparably to larger models (such as LLaMa 70B), and that special instructions must be used for instruction-tuned models to induce toxicity in synthetic discussions. We confirm that each component of our methodology contributes substantially to high quality data via an ablation study. We release an open-source framework, "SynDisco" (pip install syndisco), which implements our methodology. We also release the "Virtual Moderation Dataset" (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/vmd), a large, publicly available dataset containing LLM-generated and LLM-annotated discussions using multiple open-source LLMs.

arXiv:2503.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts in neural compression have focused on the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff, where the perception constraint ensures the source and reconstruction distributions are close in terms of a statistical divergence. Theoretical work on RDP describes properties of RDP-optimal compressors without providing constructive and low complexity solutions. While classical rate distortion theory shows that optimal compressors should efficiently pack space, RDP theory additionally shows that infinite randomness shared between the encoder and decoder may be necessary for RDP optimality. In this paper, we propose neural compressors that are low complexity and benefit from high packing efficiency through lattice coding and shared randomness through shared dithering over the lattice cells. For two important settings, namely infinite shared and zero shared randomness, we analyze the RDP tradeoff achieved by our proposed neural compressors and show optimality in both cases. Experimentally, we investigate the roles that these two components of our design, lattice coding and randomness, play in the performance of neural compressors on synthetic and real-world data. We observe that performance improves with more shared randomness and better lattice packing.

Abstract: This paper investigates backdoor attacks in image-oriented semantic communications. The threat of backdoor attacks on symbol reconstruction in semantic communication (SemCom) systems has received limited attention. Previous research on backdoor attacks targeting SemCom symbol reconstruction primarily focuses on input-level triggers, which are impractical in scenarios with strict input constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-triggered backdoor attack (CT-BA) framework that exploits inherent wireless channel characteristics as activation triggers. Our key innovation involves utilizing fundamental channel statistics parameters, specifically channel gain with different fading distributions or channel noise with different power, as potential triggers. This approach enhances stealth by eliminating explicit input manipulation, provides flexibility through trigger selection from diverse channel conditions, and enables automatic activation via natural channel variations without adversary intervention. We extensively evaluate CT-BA across four joint source-channel coding (JSCC) communication system architectures and three benchmark datasets. Simulation results demonstrate that our attack achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining effective stealth. Finally, we discuss potential defense mechanisms against such attacks.

Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's "reasoning" process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.

Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires poly-logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current studies. Existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning uniformly across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inflexible social simulation. To address this, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) framework in this paper, aiming to improve the adaptive thinking ability of language agents in dynamic social interactions. To this end, we first identify hierarchical thinking modes ranging from intuitive response to deep deliberation based on the cognitive control theory. We then develop the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm to optimize the context-aware mode switching and reasoning. Our framework advances existing research in three key aspects: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence benchmarks verify that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o. Notably, our AMPO outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains, demonstrating the advantage of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization mechanism in AMPO over GRPO's fixed-depth solution.

Abstract: We introduce new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the $\texttt{emcee}$ package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.

Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.

Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disorder that results in blurry and distorted vision. Traditional diagnostic tools, while effective, are often bulky, costly, and require professional operation. In this paper, we present a portable and innovative methodology for diagnosing. Our proposed approach first captures the image reflected on the eye's cornea when a smartphone screen-generated Placido disc sheds its light on an eye, then utilizes a two-stage diagnosis for identifying the KC cornea and pinpointing the location of the KC on the cornea. The first stage estimates the height and width of the Placido disc extracted from the captured image to identify whether it has KC. In this KC identification, k-means clustering is implemented to discern statistical characteristics, such as height and width values of extracted Placido discs, from non-KC (control) and KC-affected groups. The second stage involves the creation of a distance matrix, providing a precise localization of KC on the cornea, which is critical for efficient treatment planning. The analysis of these distance matrices, paired with a logistic regression model and robust statistical analysis, reveals a clear distinction between control and KC groups. The logistic regression model, which classifies small areas on the cornea as either control or KC-affected based on the corresponding inter-disc distances in the distance matrix, reported a classification accuracy of 96.94%, which indicates that we can effectively pinpoint the protrusion caused by KC. This comprehensive, smartphone-based method is expected to detect KC and streamline timely treatment.

Abstract: Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data, Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation. Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.

<title>Learning Long-Context Diffusion Policies via Past-Token Prediction</title>

arXiv:2505.09561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization using static datasets, avoiding the risks and costs of extensive real-world exploration. However, it struggles with suboptimal offline behaviors and inaccurate value estimation due to the lack of environmental interaction.

Leveraging model-based behavior guidance, our approach transfers commonsense knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL agent within the target domain. VeoRL achieves substantial performance gains (over 100% in some cases) across visual control tasks in robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.

Summary:
This paper introduces a solution using zero-knowledge proofs to verify the fairness of machine learning models while maintaining model confidentiality. By measuring fairness with model parameters and aggregated input information rather than specific datasets, new bounds for fairness in logistic regression and deep neural networks are derived. Efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols are developed for common fairness computations. The system FairZK is implemented, showing significant speed improvements over existing methods, with a 3.1x to 1789x decrease in prover time. FairZK can handle large models with 47 million parameters, producing a fairness proof in 343 seconds, estimated to be 4 orders of magnitude faster than current schemes limited to small models. <div>

Abstract: With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of decisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in critical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access to the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models. In this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows the model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair while preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier of naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key innovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and some aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To achieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression and deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the fairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness, including the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and fixed-point arithmetic.
  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning fairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is significantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use zero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by 3.1x--1789x depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can scale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and generates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4 orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small models with hundreds to thousands of parameters.

Abstract: To improve the identification of potential anomaly patterns in complex user behavior, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a deep mixture density network. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution characteristics commonly present in behavioral data. Unlike traditional classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural network architectures in both performance and training stability. This study provides a more expressive and discriminative solution for user behavior modeling and anomaly detection. It strongly promotes the application of deep probabilistic modeling techniques in the fields of network security and intelligent risk control.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize Customer Experience Management (CXM) in contact centers, but evaluating them is challenging due to data scarcity and limited benchmarks. To address this, CXMArena is introduced, a synthetic benchmark dataset for evaluating AI in CXM contexts. It includes realistic scenarios such as knowledge base integration, real-world noise, and operational tasks like Knowledge Base Refinement and Intent Prediction. Baseline experiments show the difficulty of these tasks, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 68% accuracy on article search.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism, failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise, or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation. Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only 68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1 score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over conventional techniques.

Summary:
In cloud services, the problem of virtual machine (VM) scheduling, specifically the Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, is addressed in this paper. Traditional optimization methods struggle with real-time changes, while domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches can be rigid. The proposed framework, MiCo, utilizes a large language model (LLM) to design heuristics and solve ODMBP efficiently. The problem is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through Option Miner and Option Composer stages. Option Miner discovers non-context-aware strategies using LLMs, while Option Composer integrates these strategies with contextual ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiCo achieves a competitive ratio of 96.9% in large-scale scenarios with over 10,000 virtual machines, even under nonstationary request flows. This framework proves effective in complex and large-scale cloud environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.

Summary:
This paper discusses the challenges of training a global model in federated learning due to heterogeneous data distributions and data privacy among clients. It introduces the concept of adaptability of local models, defined as their average performance on client data distributions, and proposes a method to enhance the global model's performance by improving this adaptability. The paper identifies the properties of an appropriate local model for good adaptability and formulates a training objective with constraints to achieve this. Experimental results on federated learning benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly boosts the adaptability of local models, leading to a consistently superior performing global model compared to baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models. Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms the baseline methods.

Summary: <br />
Efficient inference on resource-constrained devices faces challenges in utilizing compute and memory efficiently. Current systems often offload model weights to CPU memory due to limited GPU memory, causing significant I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This results in underutilization of GPU cores and minimizes the impact of GPU memory on performance. To address this, SpecOffload introduces speculative decoding into offloading, utilizing latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model to accelerate inference at minimal cost. By orchestrating the interleaved execution of target and draft models and implementing a planner for optimal tensor placement, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and enhances inference throughput by 2.54x compared to the best baseline.

This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at https://github.com/MobiSense/SpecOffload .

<div> reinforcement learning, large language models, reasoning, computational efficiency, optimization
Summary:<br /><br />Large language models have advanced reasoning abilities but often waste tokens on unnecessarily long reasoning chains. The Learning to Think (L2T) framework aims to optimize reasoning in LLMs by treating query-response interactions as hierarchical sessions with multiple episodes. L2T introduces a universal dense process reward that quantifies episode-wise information gain in model parameters without requiring extra annotations. The framework estimates this reward efficiently using PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix, reducing computational complexity. By rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes models via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode for effective updates. Empirical results across various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate that L2T enhances both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: large language models, neural scaling law, superposition, feature frequency, model dimension<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article explores the neural scaling law that governs the performance of large language models (LLMs). It investigates the relationship between model size and loss by considering the principles of representation superposition and varying feature frequencies in language. The study uses a toy model to demonstrate that the loss scaling with model size is influenced by the degree of superposition and the underlying feature frequency distribution. When superposition is weak, the loss scales with the feature frequency, while strong superposition leads to an inverse relationship between loss and model dimension. This behavior is explained geometrically by the interference between vectors in a lower dimensional space. Analysis of four LLM families confirms the presence of strong superposition and validates the predictions of the toy model. The findings suggest that representation superposition plays a crucial role in neural scaling laws and can potentially inspire new training strategies and model architectures for improved performance with fewer parameters. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.

<div> accelerated inference, language model, vision-language model, speculative decoding, multimodal adaptation<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new technique called MASSV for accelerating vision-language models (VLMs) by leveraging speculative decoding. It addresses the challenges of using small language models for vision tasks by connecting them to a VLM's visual encoder and aligning token predictions through self-distilled visual instruction tuning. MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and improves end-to-end inference speed by up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. This approach transforms existing small language models into efficient multimodal drafters, making them compatible with VLM architecture and providing scalable acceleration for current and future VLMs. <div>

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.

<div> scaling laws, large language models, test-time compute, knockout algorithm, league algorithm

Summary: 
The article introduces two algorithms for large language models (LLMs) that show provable scaling laws for test-time compute. The first algorithm is a knockout-style approach, where multiple candidate solutions are generated and then aggregated through a tournament format. Assuming the LLM can provide correct solutions with a non-zero probability, the failure probability of this algorithm decreases exponentially or via a power law as test-time compute increases. The second algorithm, a league-style approach, evaluates candidates based on their average win rate against multiple opponents. With similar assumptions, the failure probability of this algorithm also decreases exponentially with additional test-time compute. These algorithms only require a black-box LLM for implementation, making them practical and adaptable for various tasks. Extensive experiments validate the theoretical proofs and highlight the efficient scaling properties of both algorithms. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2411.19477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.

<div> Keywords: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning, Knowledge Distillation, Semantic Shift, Decision Bias, Dual-Projection Shift Estimation

Summary: 
Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) faces challenges of semantic shift and decision bias when learning new categories without retaining exemplars. To address these issues, the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach is proposed. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection method, capturing task-wise and category-wise shifts. Additionally, DPCR mitigates decision bias by using ridge regression for classifier reconstruction, reducing bias towards new tasks. Extensive experiments show that DPCR achieves a better balance between old and new task knowledge compared to existing methods. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art EFCIL methods on various datasets. The research code is available for reference on GitHub at https://github.com/RHe502/ICML25-DPCR.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate a classifier reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, on various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RHe502/ICML25-DPCR.

Summary: <br />
The article explores the use of pretraining estimators for structural econometric models, wherein the majority of computational costs and effort are invested in constructing the estimator. This approach allows for efficient application of the estimator to various datasets with minimal computational burden. By leveraging neural networks to identify model parameters from data patterns, a pretrained estimator for a challenging sequential search model was developed and tested on 12 real datasets, demonstrating quick run times and high accuracy. The pretrained estimator, available at pnnehome.github.io, exemplifies the potential of off-the-shelf estimators to enhance accessibility of structural models for researchers and practitioners. <div>

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 12 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) that integrate reasoning capabilities into reward modeling for reinforcement learning tasks. The proposed RM-R1 model employs a chain-of-rubrics mechanism to stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning rewards. The training pipeline involves distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirical results show that ReasRMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on reward model benchmarks, surpassing larger open-weight and proprietary models. The study releases six ReasRM models along with code and data for further research. Thorough empirical analyses are conducted to understand successful ReasRM training strategies. The integration of reasoning capabilities enhances interpretability and performance in reward modeling tasks. <div>

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RMs interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models - Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) - which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism - self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of RM-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analyses to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six REASRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Summary:
Gideon is a new framework that addresses the challenges of symbolic task planning in dynamic human-robot collaboration. It leverages local LLMs for on-device execution and extended context, enabling multi-domain support. A novel problem generator systematically creates large-scale datasets for various domains. Preliminary experiments show a valid plan percentage of 66.1-70.6% in single and multi-domain scenarios, indicating scalability across domains and the impact of data variety on learning efficiency. Despite training inefficiency compared to baseline models with larger LLMs, Gideon's smaller model size offers advantages in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, crucial for effective human-robot collaboration. Its streamlined data generation pipeline helps mitigate training inefficiency, making Gideon a promising solution for improving symbolic task planning in collaborative robotics. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.08492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has been extensively applied to data prediction during process ramp-up, with a particular focus on transistor characteristics for circuit design and manufacture. However, capturing the nonlinear current response across multiple operating regions remains a challenge for neural networks.

In essence, our framework incorporates physics-based knowledge with data-driven intelligence. By leveraging a dynamic weighting mechanism in its gating network, PRIME adaptively activates the suitable expert model based on distinct input data features. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various gate-all-around (GAA) structures to examine the effectiveness of PRIME and considerable improvements (60\%-84\%) in prediction accuracy are shown over state-of-the-art models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces PG-SOM, a second-order optimization scheme for reinforcement learning policies. By incorporating first-order gradient averages and a diagonal Hessian approximation, PG-SOM dynamically scales each parameter, leading to faster and more stable ascent of the expected return. The method's update is proven to be a descent direction in expectation. Experimental results on control benchmarks demonstrate up to a 2.1x increase in sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to baseline methods. This suggests that even crude second-order information can offer significant practical benefits with minimal memory overhead for policy parameters. The approach is supported by a concise derivation, ensuring the unbiased and positive-definite nature of the diagonal Hessian estimator under mild assumptions. The article also commits to providing code and reproducibility scripts for public access. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop Policy Gradient with Second-Order Momentum (PG-SOM), a lightweight second-order optimisation scheme for reinforcement-learning policies. PG-SOM augments the classical REINFORCE update with two exponentially weighted statistics: a first-order gradient average and a diagonal approximation of the Hessian. By preconditioning the gradient with this curvature estimate, the method adaptively rescales each parameter, yielding faster and more stable ascent of the expected return. We provide a concise derivation, establish that the diagonal Hessian estimator is unbiased and positive-definite under mild regularity assumptions, and prove that the resulting update is a descent direction in expectation. Numerical experiments on standard control benchmarks show up to a 2.1x increase in sample efficiency and a substantial reduction in variance compared to first-order and Fisher-matrix baselines. These results indicate that even coarse second-order information can deliver significant practical gains while incurring only D memory overhead for a D-parameter policy. All code and reproducibility scripts will be made publicly available.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, optimization, Hessian vector products, distributed computation, Transformers package 

Summary: 
HessFormer, a new software package, addresses limitations in first-order optimization of deep learning models by enabling distributed Hessian vector computation across multiple GPUs on a single node. The package integrates with the Transformers package and utilizes a distributed stochastic Lanczos quadrature algorithm. Despite significant progress in optimizing deep learning models with hundreds of billions of parameters, methods relying on Hessian vector products are still confined to single GPU performance, making them impractical for billion-parameter models. The release of HessFormer allows for investigating the Hessian spectral density of large-scale models like the Deepseek 70bn parameter model. <div>

Abstract: Whilst there have been major advancements in the field of first order optimisation of deep learning models, where state of the art open source mixture of expert models go into the hundreds of billions of parameters, methods that rely on Hessian vector products, are still limited to run on a single GPU and thus cannot even work for models in the billion parameter range. We release a software package \textbf{HessFormer}, which integrates nicely with the well known Transformers package and allows for distributed hessian vector computation across a single node with multiple GPUs. Underpinning our implementation is a distributed stochastic lanczos quadrature algorithm, which we release for public consumption. Using this package we investigate the Hessian spectral density of the recent Deepseek $70$bn parameter model.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, frequency domain analysis, X-Freq loss, Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, X-Freq, for time series forecasting, focusing on frequency domain analysis. By abandoning time domain supervision and employing the X-Freq loss, the method captures long-term and short-term frequency variations using Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform. The study emphasizes the higher information entropy in the frequency domain compared to the time domain, leading to better supervision. By incorporating X-Freq into various forecasting models without changing their original architectures or hyperparameters, the approach shows significant improvements in forecasting performance on both long-term and short-term datasets. The experimental results highlight a 3.3% average enhancement in long-term forecasting and a remarkable 27.7% improvement in short-term forecasting, showcasing the method's generality and practicality. The code for the approach will be made publicly available. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch. However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain. Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7% on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deploying deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges due to their high computational demands and rigid, static architectures. To overcome these limitations, this thesis explores methods for enabling CNNs to dynamically adjust their computational complexity based on available hardware resources. We introduce adaptive CNN architectures capable of scaling their capacity at runtime, thus efficiently balancing performance and resource utilization. To achieve this adaptability, we propose a structured pruning and dynamic re-construction approach that creates nested subnetworks within a single CNN model. This approach allows the network to dynamically switch between compact and full-sized configurations without retraining, making it suitable for deployment across varying hardware platforms. Experiments conducted across multiple CNN architectures including VGG-16, AlexNet, ResNet-20, and ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets demonstrate that adaptive models effectively maintain or even enhance performance under varying computational constraints. Our results highlight that embedding adaptability directly into CNN architectures significantly improves their robustness and flexibility, paving the way for efficient real-world deployment in diverse computational environments.

Summary:
T-ELLM is a framework designed to optimize device selection in wireless Federated Learning environments. Using natural language prompts, it enhances generalization in varying network conditions, simplifying policy generation. The framework splits the optimization problem, allowing for the learning of device selection policies while using convex optimization tools for resource allocation. By incorporating a virtual learning environment, T-ELLM efficiently captures device selection-perform relationship, leading to improved adaptability and reduced communication overhead. The theoretical analysis ensures that the learned advantage function in the virtual environment closely mirrors real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate T-ELLM's superior energy efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods, showcasing its potential for optimizing Federated Learning in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes.

Summary: 
Quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce memory footprint and inference latency but may degrade mathematical reasoning accuracy by up to 69.81%. An automated pipeline categorizes failures into four error types and identifies the most impacted reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH, and AIME. However, the substantial computational demands of these tasks pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising approach to reduce memory footprint and inference latency by representing weights and activations with lower bit-widths. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of mainstream quantization methods(e.g., AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant) on the most popular open-sourced models (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 series), and reveal that quantization can degrade mathematical reasoning accuracy by up to 69.81%. To better understand this degradation, we develop an automated assignment and judgment pipeline that qualitatively categorizes failures into four error types and quantitatively identifies the most impacted reasoning capabilities. Building on these findings, we employ an automated data-curation pipeline to construct a compact "Silver Bullet" datasets. Training a quantized model on as few as 332 carefully selected examples for just 3-5 minutes on a single GPU is enough to restore its reasoning accuracy to match that of the full-precision baseline.

<div> Reflection Hypothesis, neural networks, population activity, chunking, interpretability 

Summary:
The article challenges the view that neural networks are black boxes by proposing the Reflection Hypothesis. It suggests that neural networks exhibit patterns in their population activity that mirror training data. The authors introduce cognitive-inspired chunking methods to segment neural population dynamics into interpretable units reflecting underlying concepts. Three methods are proposed: Discrete sequence chunking (DSC), population averaging (PA), and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD). These methods effectively extract entities from neural networks of varying sizes and architectures, demonstrating a correspondence between the extracted entities and concrete or abstract concepts. Inducing these entities in neural populations alters concept generation. This work signifies a new direction for interpretability, utilizing cognitive principles and naturalistic data to unveil the hidden computations of complex learning systems, transforming them from black boxes into understandable systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods. Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Summary: 
Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a solution for privacy-preserving inference using Homomorphic Encryption. Training PNNs effectively has been a challenge due to limitations in model expressivity and numerical instability with higher-degree polynomials. A novel training framework is introduced with a Boundary Loss function that penalizes activation inputs outside a stable range exponentially and Selective Gradient Clipping to control gradient magnitudes while preserving Batch Normalization statistics. PNNs trained with this framework in deep architectures achieve high accuracy with low-degree polynomial activations and stable training with polynomial degrees up to 22. The models show performance parity with original ReLU-based models and are demonstrated to be compatible with Homomorphic Encryption, enabling accurate, stable, and secure deep learning inference. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the techniques and offer guidance on hyperparameter selection. <div>
arXiv:2505.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By replacing standard non-linearities with polynomial activations, Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) are pivotal for applications such as privacy-preserving inference via Homomorphic Encryption (HE). However, training PNNs effectively presents a significant challenge: low-degree polynomials can limit model expressivity, while higher-degree polynomials, crucial for capturing complex functions, often suffer from numerical instability and gradient explosion. We introduce a robust and versatile training framework featuring two synergistic innovations: 1) a novel Boundary Loss that exponentially penalizes activation inputs outside a predefined stable range, and 2) Selective Gradient Clipping that effectively tames gradient magnitudes while preserving essential Batch Normalization statistics. We demonstrate our framework's broad efficacy by training PNNs within deep architectures composed of HE-compatible layers (e.g., linear layers, average pooling, batch normalization, as used in ResNet variants) across diverse image, audio, and human activity recognition datasets. These models consistently achieve high accuracy with low-degree polynomial activations (such as degree 2) and, critically, exhibit stable training and strong performance with polynomial degrees up to 22, where standard methods typically fail or suffer severe degradation. Furthermore, the performance of these PNNs achieves a remarkable parity, closely approaching that of their original ReLU-based counterparts. Extensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our techniques and guide hyperparameter selection. We confirm the HE-compatibility of the trained models, advancing the practical deployment of accurate, stable, and secure deep learning inference.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an \emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach, showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel framework for feature selection that addresses the limitations of existing methods. By preserving feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space using an encoder-decoder paradigm, the framework ensures permutation invariance and captures feature interactions. An inducing point mechanism accelerates pairwise relationship computations. Additionally, the framework utilizes policy-based reinforcement learning to explore the embedding space effectively without relying on strong convex assumptions. This approach allows the reinforcement learning agent to balance multiple objectives and prioritize high-potential regions, reducing the risk of converging to local optima. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective, efficient, robust, and explicit in its feature selection process.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features. However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and explicitness of our model.

Summary: In this paper, the stability and regularity properties of continuous-time selective State-Space Models (SSMs) are investigated through the concepts of passivity and Input-to-State Stability (ISS). The study establishes that intrinsic energy dissipation leads to exponential forgetting of past states. It is proven that the unforced system dynamics possess a minimal quadratic energy function with robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity, accommodating discontinuous gating signals. By assuming a universal quadratic storage function for passivity across all inputs, parametric LMI conditions and kernel constraints are derived to limit gating mechanisms and ensure "irreversible forgetting." Sufficient conditions for global ISS are provided, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall system robustness. This research offers a systematic framework for understanding and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), characterized by input-dependent, time-varying parameters, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges for stability analysis, especially with discontinuous gating signals. In this paper, we investigate the stability and regularity properties of continuous-time selective SSMs through the lens of passivity and Input-to-State Stability (ISS). We establish that intrinsic energy dissipation guarantees exponential forgetting of past states. Crucially, we prove that the unforced system dynamics possess an underlying minimal quadratic energy function whose defining matrix exhibits robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity, accommodating discontinuous gating. Furthermore, assuming a universal quadratic storage function ensures passivity across all inputs, we derive parametric LMI conditions and kernel constraints that limit gating mechanisms, formalizing "irreversible forgetting" of recurrent models. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for global ISS, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall system robustness. Our findings offer a rigorous framework for understanding and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs.

Summary: <br />
Benign overfitting in machine learning refers to models that perfectly fit training data, including noise, while still generalizing well to new data. This study introduces the concept of almost benign overfitting, where models achieve minimal training and test errors simultaneously. This behavior, common in neural networks, can also be observed in classical regimes. The interaction between sample size and model complexity allows larger models to fit training data well and approach optimal generalization. The study explores two case studies, kernel ridge regression, and least-squares regression using a two-layer neural network, showing that almost benign overfitting can occur without restrictive assumptions. The analysis introduces a novel proof technique that decomposes excess risk, highlights the role of gradient flow as a regularizer, and provides the first generalization result for neural networks without specific assumptions about the underlying data. <div>

Abstract: Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii) least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions often required in prior work on benign overfitting.
  Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer, that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of independent interest.

Summary:
The article introduces a k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting framework, kNN-MTS, which utilizes a nearest neighbor retrieval mechanism over a large datastore of cached series without additional training. This approach allows the MTS model to access the entire dataset at test time, enhancing performance and identifying sparse but similar patterns across variables.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting ( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.

Summary:
The paper presents a novel tri-level optimization framework for enhancing the resilience of electric power systems in the face of extreme weather events. It integrates proactive infrastructure investment, adversarial modeling of disruptions, and adaptive reactive response to address the limitations of reactive approaches. By using high-probability uncertainty sets constructed with conformal prediction, complex outage patterns can be captured effectively. The framework includes a bi-level reformulation and a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the nested decision problem efficiently. Experimental results on real and synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in terms of minimizing worst-case losses and optimizing resource allocation, especially in scenarios with tight operational constraints and extensive uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Extreme weather events are placing growing strain on electric power systems, exposing the limitations of purely reactive responses and prompting the need for proactive resilience planning. However, existing approaches often rely on simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions, overlooking their critical interdependence. This paper proposes a novel tri-level optimization framework that integrates proactive infrastructure investment, adversarial modeling of spatio-temporal disruptions, and adaptive reactive response. We construct high-probability, distribution-free uncertainty sets using conformal prediction to capture complex and data-scarce outage patterns. To solve the resulting nested decision problem, we derive a bi-level reformulation via strong duality and develop a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods, achieving lower worst-case losses and more efficient resource allocation, especially under tight operational constraints and large-scale uncertainty.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) for anomaly detection in multivariate time series data. The QGAN architecture utilizes variational quantum circuits (VQCs), time-window shifting, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). By encoding data as rotation angles, the method efficiently maps classical data into quantum states while addressing hardware limitations. An anomaly scoring technique leveraging generator and discriminator outputs enhances detection accuracy. Trained using the parameter shift rule, the quantum model outperforms a classical GAN in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-scores, and mean squared error (MSE) with only 80 parameters. Despite noise-prone conditions, tests using a noisy simulator show the approach remains effective, indicating its potential for real-world applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning, including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Gaussian-Multinoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GM-RBM), an extension of the Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM designed to handle discrete, structured representations more effectively. By replacing binary hidden units with $q$-state Potts variables, the GM-RBM offers a richer latent space and supports learning over multivalued, interpretable latent concepts. The energy function, learning dynamics, and conditional distributions of GM-RBM are formally derived, demonstrating its ability to preserve tractable inference and training through contrastive divergence.

Abstract: Many real-world tasks, from associative memory to symbolic reasoning, demand discrete, structured representations that standard continuous latent models struggle to express naturally. We introduce the Gaussian-Multinoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GM-RBM), a generative energy-based model that extends the Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM (GB-RBM) by replacing binary hidden units with $q$-state Potts variables. This modification enables a combinatorially richer latent space and supports learning over multivalued, interpretable latent concepts. We formally derive GM-RBM's energy function, learning dynamics, and conditional distributions, showing that it preserves tractable inference and training through contrastive divergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that GM-RBMs model complex multimodal distributions more effectively than binary RBMs, outperforming them on tasks involving analogical recall and structured memory. Our results highlight GM-RBMs as a scalable framework for discrete latent inference with enhanced expressiveness and interoperability.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the use of machine learning, particularly neural networks, in developing heuristic policies for mixed-integer programming optimization problems, such as Branch-and-Cut (B&amp;C). The efficiency of B&amp;C algorithms depends on these policies for decision-making. The paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning B&amp;C policies with scoring functions that have a piecewise polynomial structure. This structure encompasses traditional linear models and neural network architectures with ReLU activations commonly used in practice. The theoretical framework presented in the paper provides insights into the generalization performance of learned policies from finite data and extends to a range of sequential decision-making problems beyond B&amp;C. The research bridges the gap between established theoretical works and contemporary empirical studies on machine learning in B&amp;C optimization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&amp;C) being the predominant algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&amp;C critically depends on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks, to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous sample complexity bounds for learning B&amp;C policies where the scoring functions guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&amp;C, offering a unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general sequential decision making problems beyond B&amp;C.

SemiGTX is a novel framework for fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning. It utilizes semi-supervised graph learning to provide a comprehensive analysis of sectoral economic data. The framework integrates various geospatial data modalities into a graph structure and incorporates a semi-information loss function for better region representation. By concurrently mapping GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors through multi-task learning, SemiGTX outperforms existing methods with high R2 scores. The model's generality is demonstrated through cross-regional experiments in different cities. The framework enhances explainability by analyzing the influence of different data modalities on model predictions, providing valuable insights for regional development planning. Overall, SemiGTX advances regional economic monitoring and forecasting by integrating diverse urban data sources. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities, seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model. Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise economic forecasting.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated learning systems that are subject to noisy communications. The proposed approach addresses the issue of noisy and missing values in model parameters by learning a graph that represents pairwise relationships between client parameters during aggregation. By formulating the problem as a difference-of-convex optimization and utilizing a proximal DC algorithm, the method effectively learns the graph and restores the signal (model parameters). Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving improvements of up to 2-5% in classification accuracy under biased data distributions and noisy conditions. <div>

Abstract: We propose a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated learning (FL) under noisy communications. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a central server aggregates local model parameters from multiple clients. These parameters are often noisy and/or have missing values during data collection, training, and communication between the clients and server. This may cause a considerable drop in model accuracy. To address this issue, we learn a graph that represents pairwise relationships between model parameters of the clients during aggregation. We realize it with a joint problem of graph learning and signal (i.e., model parameters) restoration. The problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization, which is efficiently solved via a proximal DC algorithm. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by up to $2$--$5\%$ in classification accuracy under biased data distributions and noisy conditions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored. Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core, UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics. Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization, even in zero-shot settings.

Summary: 
This paper presents a new analysis of the convergence of gradient descent (GD) for training overparameterized neural networks, focusing on two-layer linear networks. The study relaxes assumptions on step size, hidden-layer width, and initialization. By proving that the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition and Descent Lemma hold locally for overparameterized networks, the analysis provides bounds on local constants that depend on weights, initialization, current loss, and global model constants. Based on these bounds, a linear convergence rate for GD is derived. The analysis not only advances previous results but also suggests improved choices for step size, validated through numerical experiments. <div>
arXiv:2505.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most prior work on the convergence of gradient descent (GD) for overparameterized neural networks relies on strong assumptions on the step size (infinitesimal), the hidden-layer width (infinite), or the initialization (large, spectral, balanced). Recent efforts to relax these assumptions focus on two-layer linear networks trained with the squared loss. In this work, we derive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks with GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size, width, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that classical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems, such as the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold globally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two conditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then, we provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization of the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of the non-overparameterized model. Based on these bounds, we derive a linear convergence rate for GD. Our convergence analysis not only improves upon prior results but also suggests a better choice for the step size, as verified through our numerical experiments.

This article addresses the limitations of current distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation, focusing on the estimation of classification performance and confidence in the absence of target labels. The authors introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that leverages Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport alignment. The OT score is intuitive, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient, providing uncertainty estimates for target pseudo-labels without retraining the model.

Abstract: We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), particularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and confidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically rigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model retraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source information. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that classification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing low-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms existing confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Parameter estimation in inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) underpins modeling across scientific disciplines, especially when parameters vary in space or time. Physics-informed Machine Learning (PhiML) integrates PDE constraints into deep learning, but prevailing approaches depend on recursive automatic differentiation (autodiff), which produces inaccurate high-order derivatives, inflates memory usage, and underperforms in noisy settings. We propose Mollifier Layers, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic module that replaces autodiff with convolutional operations using analytically defined mollifiers. This reframing of derivative computation as smoothing integration enables efficient, noise-robust estimation of high-order derivatives directly from network outputs. Mollifier Layers attach at the output layer and require no architectural modifications. We compare them with three distinct architectures and benchmark performance across first-, second-, and fourth-order PDEs -- including Langevin dynamics, heat diffusion, and reaction-diffusion systems -- observing significant improvements in memory efficiency, training time and accuracy for parameter recovery across tasks. To demonstrate practical relevance, we apply Mollifier Layers to infer spatially varying epigenetic reaction rates from super-resolution chromatin imaging data -- a real-world inverse problem with biomedical significance. Our results establish Mollifier Layers as an efficient and scalable tool for physics-constrained learning.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks using the concept of the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). The RTG represents linear regions induced by activation patterns, with edges connecting regions differing by a single neuron flip. The study establishes tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, proving its connectivity and linking its geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. The research also explores the relationship between RTG properties like entropy and average degree with generalization error, offering insights into network structure across various depths, widths, and data scenarios. By leveraging graph theory in analyzing ReLU networks, the work paves the way for advancements in compression, regularization, and complexity management based on RTG analysis. <div>
arXiv:2505.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

Abstract: We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth, width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary: fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous neural systems.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Qronos, a novel post-training quantization algorithm for neural networks. Qronos sequentially rounds and updates weights, explicitly addressing errors from weight, activation quantization, and prior layer quantization. It follows an interpretable optimization framework, outperforming existing data-driven methods with optimal update rules for error correction and diffusion. The algorithm's efficient implementation uses Cholesky decomposition for least-squares problems. Qronos is compatible with transformation techniques like incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization. Evaluations on autoregressive language models show Qronos consistently exceeds previous adaptive rounding methods in quantizing weights, activations, and KV caches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

<div> Wasserstein correlation, statistical dependence, representation learning, unsupervised, autoencoder <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper explores the use of Wasserstein correlation for unsupervised representation learning. Unlike contrastive methods, which cluster classes in the latent space, an encoder trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while maintaining the input distribution's properties. The authors demonstrate that maximizing Wasserstein correlation can create an (auto)encoder that is invariant to chosen augmentations while preserving the input distribution's structural properties. They introduce the concept of an augmented encoder using Markov-Wasserstein kernels to achieve this invariance. Experimental results show that simple feedforward networks can acquire invariants or impart invariants to pretrained models through this training process. Theoretical results for optimal transport-based dependence measures are also established. Code for the approach is available on GitHub at https://github.com/keenan-eikenberry/wasserstein_correlation_maximization. <div>

Abstract: This work investigates the use of Wasserstein correlation -- a normalized measure of statistical dependence based on the Wasserstein distance between a joint distribution and the product of its marginals -- for unsupervised representation learning. Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which naturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded distributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while approximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input distribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation maximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from scratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is approximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of augmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties of the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion of an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When the maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed to the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the desired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which show that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or can, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under this training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results for optimal transport-based dependence measures.

<div> Reinforcement learning, large language models, parameter update sparsity, test accuracy, subnetworks<br />
<br />Summary: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) in large language models (LLMs) improves downstream task performance and alignment with human values by updating only a small subnetwork of parameters. This parameter update sparsity occurs across various RL algorithms and LLMs without explicit sparsity-promoting regularizations. Finetuning the subnetwork alone yields similar results to full finetuning and shows high overlap across different random seeds and training data. The sparsity is not due to updating only a subset of layers but is spread across all parameter matrices. RL updates a small subset of parameters that cover the full subspaces of the matrices. Training data proximity to the policy distribution, rather than regularization techniques like KL regularization, primarily drives this update sparsity. <div>
arXiv:2505.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) yields substantial improvements in large language models (LLMs) downstream task performance and alignment with human values. Surprisingly, such large gains result from updating only a small subnetwork comprising just 5 percent to 30 percent of the parameters, with the rest effectively unchanged. We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity induced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments. This sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting regularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone recovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical to the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random seeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap than expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to updating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices receive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter matrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of parameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter matrices can represent. We conjecture that the this update sparsity can be primarily attributed to training on data that is near the policy distribution, techniques that encourage the policy to remain close to the pretrained model, such as the KL regularization and gradient clipping, have limited impact.

<div> actor-critic, reinforcement learning, bilevel optimization, Stackelberg game, Nystr\"om method
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new algorithm called Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients (BLPO) for actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning, which addresses the dependencies between the actor and critic in AC algorithms. By treating AC as a bilevel optimization problem, BLPO modifies the traditional AC approach by nesting the critic's update to learn a best response to the actor's policy and computing a hypergradient using the Nystr\"om method. The algorithm is proven to converge to a local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability and demonstrates competitive performance on various control tasks compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). BLPO's innovation lies in its handling of the nested structure of the bilevel optimization problem and its efficient computation of the hypergradient, making it a promising approach in the field of reinforcement learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO) problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients (BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and leverages the Nystr\"om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability, assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks.

Summary:
Multi-modal large language models (MLLM) based web agents interact with web pages using screenshots. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate web agents to perform specific actions. Existing attacks have limitations in effectiveness, stealthiness, or practicality. The proposed EnvInjection attack perturbs raw pixel values of web page screenshots to induce target actions. The attack involves modifying webpage source code to add perturbations, then using a neural network to approximate pixel-to-screenshot mapping for optimization. The non-differentiable mapping requires projected gradient descent for optimization.

arXiv:2505.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Summary:
The paper introduces the m-out-of-n bootstrap method for estimating sample quantiles without known nuisance parameters. It establishes a central limit theorem for the data-driven estimator under mild moment conditions and provides exact convergence rates through an Edgeworth expansion. The research also includes a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap approximation error. By demonstrating the theory's application to practical statistics like quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and rewards of ergodic Markov decision processes, the paper showcases the parameter-free asymptotic distributions for modern estimation and learning tasks. The study's findings contribute to robust inference with heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and various large-sample applications in econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet (1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications. Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics, including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method to improve efficiency in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) by distilling the aligned confidence of a Bayesian LLM into a non-Bayesian student LLM. By minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions, this approach eliminates the need for test-time sampling, making uncertainty estimation N-times more efficient compared to traditional Bayesian methods. The distillation is conducted solely on the training dataset without requiring an additional validation dataset. The experiments show that the uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data generalize well to unseen test data, producing results that are comparable to, or better than state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs. Overall, this method offers a simple yet effective way to improve efficiency and reliability in uncertainty estimation for LLMs.

arXiv:2505.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation. Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than) state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

This paper introduces a token-level uncertainty estimation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generation quality in mathematical reasoning tasks. By applying low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, the framework generates predictive distributions to estimate token-level uncertainties, which are aggregated to reflect semantic uncertainty in generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets show strong correlations between token-level uncertainty metrics, answer correctness, and model robustness. The approach also leverages uncertainty to enhance reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm, consistently outperforming existing methods. Effective uncertainty estimation emerges as a valuable tool for evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2505.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Summary:
POCAII is a new hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithm that separates the search and evaluation phases, focusing on generating configurations early on and increasing evaluation effort later. Compared to existing approaches like SMAC, BOHB, and DEHB, POCAII shows superior performance in low-budget HPO scenarios. Its flexibility makes it suitable for real-world problems where resources are limited. The algorithm exhibits higher robustness and lower variance in results, making it particularly valuable for expensive model training. These findings highlight POCAII's potential for practical applications in scenarios with constrained resources. <div>
arXiv:2505.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose for the first time the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithm POCAII. POCAII differs from the Hyperband and Successive Halving literature by explicitly separating the search and evaluation phases and utilizing principled approaches to exploration and exploitation principles during both phases. Such distinction results in a highly flexible scheme for managing a hyperparameter optimization budget by focusing on search (i.e., generating competing configurations) towards the start of the HPO process while increasing the evaluation effort as the HPO comes to an end.
  POCAII was compared to state of the art approaches SMAC, BOHB and DEHB. Our algorithm shows superior performance in low-budget hyperparameter optimization regimes. Since many practitioners do not have exhaustive resources to assign to HPO, it has wide applications to real-world problems. Moreover, the empirical evidence showed how POCAII demonstrates higher robustness and lower variance in the results. This is again very important when considering realistic scenarios with extremely expensive models to train.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces the concept of high-order momentum in optimizing machine learning models, focusing on utilizing third-power gradients. The research shows that incorporating third-power gradients can enhance convergence bounds for convex and smooth nonconvex optimization problems. Empirical experiments across various optimization tasks demonstrate that high-order momentum consistently outperforms traditional low-order momentum methods, achieving superior performance. Theoretical analysis supports the efficacy of high-order momentum in accelerating convergence and escaping stationary points in optimization algorithms. This novel approach offers a promising direction for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of momentum-based optimization techniques in advanced machine learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum-based gradients are essential for optimizing advanced machine learning models, as they not only accelerate convergence but also advance optimizers to escape stationary points. While most state-of-the-art momentum techniques utilize lower-order gradients, such as the squared first-order gradient, there has been limited exploration of higher-order gradients, particularly those raised to powers greater than two. In this work, we introduce the concept of high-order momentum, where momentum is constructed using higher-power gradients, with a focus on the third-power of the first-order gradient as a representative case. Our research offers both theoretical and empirical support for this approach. Theoretically, we demonstrate that incorporating third-power gradients can improve the convergence bounds of gradient-based optimizers for both convex and smooth nonconvex problems. Empirically, we validate these findings through extensive experiments across convex, smooth nonconvex, and nonsmooth nonconvex optimization tasks. Across all cases, high-order momentum consistently outperforms conventional low-order momentum methods, showcasing superior performance in various optimization problems.

Summary:
Permutation randomization in gradient-based optimization disrupts the shrinkage behavior, enabling continuous convergence to the global optimum with enough iterations. It can maintain the convergence rate of the underlying optimizer. Empirical experiments comparing permutation-randomized optimizers to baseline methods, including training deep neural networks and optimizing noisy objective functions, validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate practical benefits. The study provides a strong theoretical foundation and empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of permutation randomization. The findings have implications for utilizing a variety of randomization techniques in optimization processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While gradient-based optimizers that incorporate randomization often showcase superior performance on complex optimization, the theoretical foundations underlying this superiority remain insufficiently understood. A particularly pressing question has emerged: What is the role of randomization in dimension-free nonsmooth nonconvex optimization? To address this gap, we investigate the theoretical and empirical impact of permutation randomization within gradient-based optimization frameworks, using it as a representative case to explore broader implications. From a theoretical perspective, our analyses reveal that permutation randomization disrupts the shrinkage behavior of gradient-based optimizers, facilitating continuous convergence toward the global optimum given a sufficiently large number of iterations. Additionally, we prove that permutation randomization can preserve the convergence rate of the underlying optimizer. On the empirical side, we conduct extensive numerical experiments comparing permutation-randomized optimizer against three baseline methods. These experiments span tasks such as training deep neural networks with stacked architectures and optimizing noisy objective functions. The results not only corroborate our theoretical insights but also highlight the practical benefits of permutation randomization. In summary, this work delivers both rigorous theoretical justification and compelling empirical evidence for the effectiveness of permutation randomization. Our findings and evidence lay a foundation for extending analytics to encompass a wide array of randomization.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, SAEs, feature hedging, LLMs, interpretability
Summary: 
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are thought to break down polysemantic activations into understandable linear directions. However, narrow SAEs might merge correlated features, thereby compromising the monosemanticity of the model. This phenomenon, called feature hedging, is worsened in LLM SAEs due to reconstruction loss. This issue likely contributes to SAEs consistently performing below supervised baselines. The study introduces feature hedging theoretically and empirically, proposing an enhanced matryoshka SAE variant. Despite the fundamental challenges with SAEs, understanding feature hedging could lead to advancements in interpreting LLMs on a larger scale.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting LLMs at scale.

<div> topology-aware aggregation, decentralized learning, OOD knowledge propagation, communication topologies, model aggregation <br />
<br />Summary: <br />Decentralized learning allows collaborative training of models using distributed data without a centralized approach. Devices communicate with neighboring devices to update local models through model aggregation. The study focuses on out-of-distribution (OOD) knowledge propagation and its challenges with popular decentralized learning algorithms. The location of OOD data in a topology and the topology structure itself significantly impact knowledge propagation. Topology-aware aggregation strategies are proposed to enhance OOD knowledge propagation across devices, resulting in a 123% improvement in accuracy compared to topology-unaware methods. This research highlights the importance of considering communication topologies and adopting topology-aware techniques in decentralized learning systems. <div>

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore, knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds. We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD) knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself, significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.

<div> Kernel Integral Operator, Neural Operators, Quantum Simulation, Schrödingerised Kernel Neural Operator, Benchmark Tests

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework for neural operators called Schrödingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) that operates on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain, aligning better with the evolution of systems. The SKNO outperforms other methods in experiments, displaying state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests and zero-shot super-resolution tasks. The impact of different lifting and recovering operators on predictions within the framework is analyzed, highlighting the alignment between the model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution. The linear evolution process in neural operators is elucidated, drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations. The proposed SKNO demonstrates superior performance in capturing the evolution of systems compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

<div> Keywords: interpretability, neural networks, out-of-distribution prediction, causal mechanisms, language models

Summary: 
This study explores the use of interpretability techniques to predict model behavior on out-of-distribution examples. By examining a variety of language modeling tasks, including symbol manipulation and knowledge retrieval, the researchers demonstrate that causal features play a crucial role in predicting model correctness. Two novel methods, counterfactual simulation and value probing, are proposed to leverage causal mechanisms for predicting model outputs, showing high AUC-ROC performance both in and out of distribution. The study highlights the importance of internal causal analysis in language models for improving prediction accuracy in various tasks. This research offers a significant contribution to the field of interpretability in neural networks by showcasing the potential of causal mechanisms in enhancing model performance on diverse language tasks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

<div> Keywords: transfer learning, negative transfer, residual feature integration, source-side representation, target-side encoder

Summary:
Transfer learning is a method often used to improve performance on a target task by leveraging a pre-trained model's representations from a source domain. However, negative transfer can occur when the source representation does not align with the target distribution. The proposed method, Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), combines a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder to prevent negative transfer. The approach adapts to the target domain while retaining transferable knowledge from the source domain. Theoretical analysis shows that REFINE can prevent negative transfer and offers a theoretical benefit in generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that REFINE consistently enhances performance across various data modalities and outperforms other solutions. The method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and robust, making it a valuable addition to transfer learning techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning toolbox.

Summary: 
- The article introduces a method called LAMP (Linear Attribution Mapping Probe) to analyze the decision-making process of black-box language models.
- LAMP uses the model's self-reported explanations as a coordinate system to reveal the factors influencing the model's predictions.
- It applies LAMP to tasks like sentiment analysis and controversial-topic detection, showing that many language models have locally linear decision surfaces.
- The study finds that the decision landscapes identified by LAMP correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and clinical expert assessments.
- LAMP is a practical framework that does not require access to internal model information, making it suitable for auditing proprietary language models and assessing their consistency with provided explanations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LAMP} (\textbf{L}inear \textbf{A}ttribution \textbf{M}apping \textbf{P}robe), a method that shines light onto a black-box language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: \textit{sentiment analysis}, \textit{controversial-topic detection}, and \textit{safety-prompt auditing}. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces HARDMath2, a dataset of 211 original math problems designed by students and instructors at Harvard to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These problems cover core topics in applied math and were created through a collaborative environment where students refined problems and tested LLM-generated solutions. Evaluation results show current LLMs struggle with many of these problems, highlighting a gap in their mathematical reasoning skills. Students identified strategies to create more challenging problems by interacting with LLMs, leading to a richer benchmark and improved understanding of course material. This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing LLMs' abilities in approximation-based problems, given their growing role in solving complex challenges across various fields. <div>
arXiv:2505.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in mathematical problem-solving, but evaluation has largely focused on problems that have exact analytical solutions or involve formal proofs, often overlooking approximation-based problems ubiquitous in applied science and engineering. To fill this gap, we build on prior work and present HARDMath2, a dataset of 211 original problems covering the core topics in an introductory graduate applied math class, including boundary-layer analysis, WKB methods, asymptotic solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the asymptotics of oscillatory integrals. This dataset was designed and verified by the students and instructors of a core graduate applied mathematics course at Harvard. We build the dataset through a novel collaborative environment that challenges students to write and refine difficult problems consistent with the class syllabus, peer-validate solutions, test different models, and automatically check LLM-generated solutions against their own answers and numerical ground truths. Evaluation results show that leading frontier models still struggle with many of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the mathematical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Importantly, students identified strategies to create increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the models and exploiting common failure modes. This back-and-forth with the models not only resulted in a richer and more challenging benchmark but also led to qualitative improvements in the students' understanding of the course material, which is increasingly important as we enter an age where state-of-the-art language models can solve many challenging problems across a wide domain of fields.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

Summary: The article introduces the Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) as a new approach for deep time series forecasting. While Fourier Transform (FT) struggles with capturing multi-scale patterns, and Wavelet Transform (WT) is insensitive to time series change points, WDT excels at extracting time-aware patterns that encompass both overall trends and subtle fluctuations. WDT operates on the derivative of the series, magnifying rate-of-change cues and revealing abrupt regime shifts crucial for modeling. Incorporated into the WaveTS framework, WDT decomposes input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them through linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets showcase that WaveTS delivers top-tier forecasting accuracy with high computational efficiency.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets, assuming exchangeability. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual $1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending on the distribution of weights. We extend our framework to data-dependent weights, and we derive a general procedure for data-dependent weight aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic and real data in the mixture-of-experts setting, and we show that aggregation with data-dependent weights provides a form of adaptive coverage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro, BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation for future research. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/VenusX.

Abstract: This paper investigates approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on multi-turn tool-use scenarios, which can be naturally modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing approaches often train multi-turn LLM agents with trajectory-level advantage estimation in bandit settings, they struggle with turn-level credit assignment across multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on multi-turn reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce a fine-grained turn-level advantage estimation strategy to enable more precise credit assignment in multi-turn agent interactions. The strategy is general and can be incorporated into various RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our experimental evaluation on multi-turn reasoning and search-based tool-use tasks with GRPO implementations highlights the effectiveness of the MDP framework and the turn-level credit assignment in advancing the multi-turn reasoning capabilities of LLM agents in complex decision-making settings. Our method achieves 100% success in tool execution and 50% accuracy in exact answer matching, significantly outperforming baselines, which fail to invoke tools and achieve only 20-30% exact match accuracy.

Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT (Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved training stability.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have received considerable recent attention as tools for mechanistic interpretability, showing success at extracting interpretable features even from very large LLMs. However, this research has been largely empirical, and there have been recent doubts about the true utility of SAEs. In this work, we seek to enhance the theoretical understanding of SAEs, using the spline theory of deep learning. By situating SAEs in this framework: we discover that SAEs generalise ``$k$-means autoencoders'' to be piecewise affine, but sacrifice accuracy for interpretability vs. the optimal ``$k$-means-esque plus local principal component analysis (PCA)'' piecewise affine autoencoder. We characterise the underlying geometry of (TopK) SAEs using power diagrams. And we develop a novel proximal alternating method SGD (PAM-SGD) algorithm for training SAEs, with both solid theoretical foundations and promising empirical results in MNIST and LLM experiments, particularly in sample efficiency and (in the LLM setting) improved sparsity of codes.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and efficient student models.

<title>On the $O(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{K^{1/4}})$ Convergence Rate of AdamW Measured by $\ell_1$ Norm</title>

Abstract: As the default optimizer for training large language models, AdamW has achieved remarkable success in deep learning. However, its convergence behavior is not theoretically well-understood. This paper establishes the convergence rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_1\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$ for AdamW measured by $\ell_1$ norm, where $K$ represents the iteration number, $d$ denotes the model dimension, and $C$ matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we have $E\left[\|\nabla f(x)\|_1\right]\geq\sqrt{\frac{2d}{\pi}}E\left[\|\nabla f(x)\|_2\right]$ when each element of $\nabla f(x)$ is generated from Gaussian distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. Empirically, our experimental results on real-world deep learning tasks reveal $\|\nabla f(x)\|_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d})\|\nabla f(x)\|_2$. Both support that our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD.

<title>Learning on a Razor's Edge: the Singularity Bias of Polynomial Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks often infer sparse representations, converging to a subnetwork during the learning process. In this work, we theoretically analyze subnetworks and their bias through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider fully-connected networks with polynomial activation functions, and focus on the geometry of the function space they parametrize, often referred to as neuromanifold. First, we compute the dimension of the subspace of the neuromanifold parametrized by subnetworks. Second, we show that this subspace is singular. Third, we argue that such singularities often correspond to critical points of the training dynamics. Lastly, we discuss convolutional networks, for which subnetworks and singularities are similarly related, but the bias does not arise.

<title>Bridging the Reality Gap in Digital Twins with Context-Aware, Physics-Guided Deep Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11847</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11847</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable powerful predictive analytics, but persistent discrepancies between simulations and real systems--known as the reality gap--undermine their reliability. Coined in robotics, the term now applies to DTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain interactions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is pressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational context, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage: simulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios difficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model alignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in robotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike one-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's lifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of out-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs often perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from observations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain purely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some approaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation techniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data, detects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our approach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator guidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency. We illustrate the RGA module in a structural health monitoring case study on a steel truss bridge in Pittsburgh, PA, showing faster calibration and better real-world alignment.

<title>Q-Policy: Quantum-Enhanced Policy Evaluation for Scalable Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Q-Policy, a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework that mathematically accelerates policy evaluation and optimization by exploiting quantum computing primitives. Q-Policy encodes value functions in quantum superposition, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices, addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.

<title>Learning Pareto-Optimal Rewards from Noisy Preferences: A Framework for Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.

<title>J1: Exploring Simple Test-Time Scaling for LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$ surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally, we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3) Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level, structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.

<title>MINGLE: Mixtures of Null-Space Gated Low-Rank Experts for Test-Time Continual Model Merging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average across diverse task orders.

<title>Fast RoPE Attention: Combining the Polynomial Method and Fast Fourier Transform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has been widely applied to many machine learning tasks. A main bottleneck in the time to perform transformer computations is a task called attention computation. [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] have shown that in the bounded entry regime, there is an almost linear time algorithm to approximate the attention computation. They also proved that the bounded entry assumption is necessary for a fast algorithm assuming the popular Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  A new version of transformer which uses position embeddings has recently been very successful. At a high level, position embedding enables the model to capture the correlations between tokens while taking into account their position in the sequence. Perhaps the most popular and effective version is Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which was proposed by [Su, Lu, Pan, Murtadha, Wen, and Liu, Neurocomputing 2024].
  A main downside of RoPE is that it complicates the attention computation problem, so that previous techniques for designing almost linear time algorithms no longer seem to work. In this paper, we show how to overcome this issue, and give a new algorithm to compute the RoPE attention in almost linear time in the bounded entry regime. (Again, known lower bounds imply that bounded entries are necessary.) Our new algorithm combines two techniques in a novel way: the polynomial method, which was used in prior fast attention algorithms, and the Fast Fourier Transform.

<title>AdaCoT: Pareto-Optimal Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Triggering via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance on complex tasks.

arXiv:2505.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate time series tasks as input-output mappings under varying objectives, where the same input may yield different outputs. This challenges a model's generalization and adaptability. To study this, we construct a synthetic dataset with numerous conflicting subtasks to evaluate adaptation under frequent task shifts. Existing static models consistently fail in such settings. We propose a dynamic perturbed adaptive method based on a trunk-branch architecture, where the trunk evolves slowly to capture long-term structure, and branch modules are re-initialized and updated for each task. This enables continual test-time adaptation and cross-task transfer without relying on explicit task labels. Theoretically, we show that this architecture has strictly higher functional expressivity than static models and LoRA. We also establish exponential convergence of branch adaptation under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex and conflicting task environments, exhibiting fast adaptation and progressive learning capabilities.

Abstract: Clustering is a widely used and powerful machine learning technique, but its effectiveness is often limited by the need to specify the number of clusters, k, or by relying on thresholds that implicitly determine k. We introduce k*-means, a novel clustering algorithm that eliminates the need to set k or any other parameters. Instead, it uses the minimum description length principle to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, k*, by splitting and merging clusters while also optimising the standard k-means objective. We prove that k*-means is guaranteed to converge and demonstrate experimentally that it significantly outperforms existing methods in scenarios where k is unknown. We also show that it is accurate in estimating k, and that empirically its runtime is competitive with existing methods, and scales well with dataset size.

Abstract: Multi-agent simulations enables the modeling and analyses of the dynamic behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities evolving in complex environments. Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent phenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational cost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations requiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty quantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for real-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these limitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning approximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide cheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression models, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been applied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and interpretability.
  This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate modeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model, we highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate models, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance. Finally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within ABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support across various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern artificial intelligence, among which the capability of implicitly learning an internal model during inference time is widely believed to play a key role in the under standing of pre-trained large language models. However, most recent works have been focusing on studying supervised learning topics such as in-context learning, leaving the field of unsupervised learning largely unexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations). These results bridge the gap between practical success and theoretical understanding, positioning transformers as versatile tools for unsupervised learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.

<title>The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.

<title>How can Diffusion Models Evolve into Continual Generators?</title>

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG) paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.

<title>Exploring Criteria of Loss Reweighting to Enhance LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted a surprising alignment between gradients and the top eigenspace of the Hessian -- termed the Dominant subspace -- during neural network training. Concurrently, there has been growing interest in the distinct roles of sharp and flat directions in the Hessian spectrum. In this work, we study Bulk-SGD, a variant of SGD that restricts updates to the orthogonal complement of the Dominant subspace. Through ablation studies, we characterize the stability properties of Bulk-SGD and identify critical hyperparameters that govern its behavior. We show that updates along the Bulk subspace, corresponding to flatter directions in the loss landscape, can accelerate convergence but may compromise stability. To balance these effects, we introduce interpolated gradient methods that unify SGD, Dom-SGD, and Bulk-SGD. Finally, we empirically connect this subspace decomposition to the Generalized Gauss-Newton and Functional Hessian terms, showing that curvature energy is largely concentrated in the Dominant subspace. Our findings suggest a principled approach to designing curvature-aware optimizers.

<title>FedHQ: Hybrid Runtime Quantization for Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized model training approach that preserves data privacy but struggles with low efficiency. Quantization, a powerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for integration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct performance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a result, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT, optimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently accelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL settings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and QAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of using hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and accuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related analysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off boundaries for strategy selection. Based on these, we proposed a novel framework named FedHQ to automatically adopt optimal hybrid strategy allocation for FL systems. Specifically, FedHQ develops a coarse-grained global initialization and fine-grained ML-based adjustment to ensure efficiency and robustness. Experiments show that FedHQ achieves up to 2.47x times training acceleration and up to 11.15% accuracy improvement and negligible extra overhead.

<title>Variance-Optimal Arm Selection: Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification</title>

arXiv:2505.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on selecting the arm with the highest variance from a set of $K$ independent arms. Specifically, we focus on two settings: (i) regret setting, that penalizes the number of pulls of suboptimal arms in terms of variance, and (ii) fixed-budget \ac{BAI} setting, that evaluates the ability of an algorithm to determine the arm with the highest variance after a fixed number of pulls. We develop a novel online algorithm called \texttt{UCB-VV} for the regret setting and show that its upper bound on regret for bounded rewards evolves as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log{n}\right)$ where $n$ is the horizon. By deriving the lower bound on the regret, we show that \texttt{UCB-VV} is order optimal. For the fixed budget \ac{BAI} setting and propose the \texttt{SHVV} algorithm. We show that the upper bound of the error probability of \texttt{SHVV} evolves as $\exp\left(-\frac{n}{\log(K) H}\right)$, where $H$ represents the complexity of the problem, and this rate matches the corresponding lower bound. We extend the framework from bounded distributions to sub-Gaussian distributions using a novel concentration inequality on the sample variance. Leveraging the same, we derive a concentration inequality for the empirical Sharpe ratio (SR) for sub-Gaussian distributions, which was previously unknown in the literature. Empirical simulations show that \texttt{UCB-VV} consistently outperforms \texttt{$\epsilon$-greedy} across different sub-optimality gaps though it is surpassed by \texttt{VTS}, which exhibits the lowest regret, albeit lacking in theoretical guarantees. We also illustrate the superior performance of \texttt{SHVV}, for a fixed budget setting under 6 different setups against uniform sampling. Finally, we conduct a case study to empirically evaluate the performance of the \texttt{UCB-VV} and \texttt{SHVV} in call option trading on $100$ stocks generated using \ac{GBM}.

<title>Parameter Efficient Continual Learning with Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.

<title>Approximation theory for 1-Lipschitz ResNets</title>

Abstract: 1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation for their practical use.

Abstract: The neural operator (NO) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent NOs are dominated by the Transformer architecture, which offers NOs the capability to capture long-range dependencies in PDE dynamics. However, existing Transformer-based NOs suffer from quadratic complexity, lack geometric rigor, and thus suffer from sub-optimal performance on regular grids. As a remedy, we propose the Geometric Mamba Neural Operator (GeoMaNO) framework, which empowers NOs with Mamba's modeling capability, linear complexity, plus geometric rigor. We evaluate GeoMaNO's performance on multiple standard and popularly employed PDE benchmarks, spanning from Darcy flow problems to Navier-Stokes problems. GeoMaNO improves existing baselines in solution operator approximation by as much as 58.9%.

<title>Spotlight Your Instructions: Instruction-following with Dynamic Attention Steering</title>

Abstract: In many real-world applications, users rely on natural language instructions to guide large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. These instructions are often complex, diverse, and subject to frequent change. However, LLMs do not always attend to these instructions reliably, and users lack simple mechanisms to emphasize their importance beyond modifying prompt wording or structure. To address this, we present an inference-time method that enables users to emphasize specific parts of their prompt by steering the model's attention toward them, aligning the model's perceived importance of different prompt tokens with user intent. Unlike prior approaches that are limited to static instructions, require significant offline profiling, or rely on fixed biases, we dynamically update the proportion of model attention given to the user-specified parts--ensuring improved instruction following without performance degradation. We demonstrate that our approach improves instruction following across a variety of tasks involving multiple instructions and generalizes across models of varying scales.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens. In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) problems are fundamental in online decision-making and have been instrumental in finding an optimal policy for Markov decision processes (MDPs). Function approximations are usually deployed to handle large or infinite state-action space. In our work, we consider the RL problems with function approximation and we develop a new algorithm to solve it efficiently. Our algorithm is based on the linear programming (LP) reformulation and it resolves the LP at each iteration improved with new data arrival. Such a resolving scheme enables our algorithm to achieve an instance-dependent sample complexity guarantee, more precisely, when we have $N$ data, the output of our algorithm enjoys an instance-dependent $\tilde{O}(1/N)$ suboptimality gap. In comparison to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ worst-case guarantee established in the previous literature, our instance-dependent guarantee is tighter when the underlying instance is favorable, and the numerical experiments also reveal the efficient empirical performances of our algorithms.

<title>Safe Delta: Consistently Preserving Safety when Fine-Tuning LLMs on Diverse Datasets</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign, can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets (e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.

Abstract: Attention mechanism has emerged as a foundation module of modern deep learning models and has also empowered many milestones in various domains. Moreover, FlashAttention with IO-aware speedup resolves the efficiency issue of standard attention, further promoting its practicality. Beyond canonical attention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position bias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold. In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent, which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

Abstract: Port berthing sites are regions of high interest for monitoring and optimizing port operations. Data sourced from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be superimposed on berths enabling their real-time monitoring and revealing long-term utilization patterns. Ultimately, insights from multiple berths can uncover bottlenecks, and lead to the optimization of the underlying supply chain of the port and beyond. However, publicly available documentation of port berths, even when available, is frequently incomplete - e.g. there may be missing berths or inaccuracies such as incorrect boundary boxes - necessitating a more robust, data-driven approach to port berth localization. In this context, we propose an unsupervised spatial modeling method that leverages AIS data clustering and hyperparameter optimization to identify berthing sites. Trained on one month of freely available AIS data and evaluated across ports of varying sizes, our models significantly outperform competing methods, achieving a mean Bhattacharyya distance of 0.85 when comparing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) trained on separate data splits, compared to 13.56 for the best existing method. Qualitative comparison with satellite images and existing berth labels further supports the superiority of our method, revealing more precise berth boundaries and improved spatial resolution across diverse port environments.

Abstract: Recent work has formalized the reward hypothesis through the lens of expected utility theory, by interpreting reward as utility. Hausner's foundational work showed that dropping the continuity axiom leads to a generalization of expected utility theory where utilities are lexicographically ordered vectors of arbitrary dimension. In this paper, we extend this result by identifying a simple and practical condition under which preferences cannot be represented by scalar rewards, necessitating a 2-dimensional reward function. We provide a full characterization of such reward functions, as well as the general d-dimensional case, in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under a memorylessness assumption on preferences. Furthermore, we show that optimal policies in this setting retain many desirable properties of their scalar-reward counterparts, while in the Constrained MDP (CMDP) setting -- another common multiobjective setting -- they do not.

Abstract: Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery. We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations. Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various physical systems, such as fluid and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the laws of physics.

arXiv:2505.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain, ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including large language models. Theoretical verification shows that AP-Calculus not only extends but can also subsume traditional do-calculus for many practical applications, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised learning contexts.

Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field (MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode. Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias (IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and average-pooling layers.

Abstract: The combinatorial structure of many real-world action spaces leads to exponential growth in the number of possible actions, limiting the effectiveness of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent approaches for combinatorial action spaces impose factorized or sequential structures over sub-actions, failing to capture complex joint behavior. We introduce the Sub-Action Interaction Network using Transformers (SAINT), a novel policy architecture that represents multi-component actions as unordered sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with standard policy optimization algorithms. In 15 distinct combinatorial environments across three task domains, including environments with nearly 17 million joint actions, SAINT consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: We propose new graph kernels grounded in the study of metric graphs via tropical algebraic geometry. In contrast to conventional graph kernels that are based on graph combinatorics such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs, our graph kernels are purely based on the geometry and topology of the underlying metric space. A key characterizing property of our construction is its invariance under edge subdivision, making the kernels intrinsically well-suited for comparing graphs that represent different underlying spaces. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these kernels and analyze their complexity, showing that it depends primarily on the genus of the input graphs. Empirically, our kernels outperform existing methods in label-free settings, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. We further highlight their practical utility through an urban road network classification task.

Abstract: Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.

Abstract: Transformers have shown a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL), making predictions based on contextual examples. However, while theoretical analyses have explored this prediction capability, the nature of the inferred context and its utility for downstream predictions remain open questions. This paper aims to address these questions by examining ICL for inverse linear regression (ILR), where context inference can be characterized by unsupervised learning of underlying weight vectors. Focusing on the challenging scenario of rank-deficient inverse problems, where context length is smaller than the number of unknowns in the weight vectors and regularization is necessary, we introduce a linear transformer to learn the inverse mapping from contextual examples to the underlying weight vector. Our findings reveal that the transformer implicitly learns both a prior distribution and an effective regularization strategy, outperforming traditional ridge regression and regularization methods. A key insight is the necessity of low task dimensionality relative to the context length for successful learning. Furthermore, we numerically verify that the error of the transformer estimator scales linearly with the noise level, the ratio of task dimension to context length, and the condition number of the input data. These results not only demonstrate the potential of transformers for solving ill-posed inverse problems, but also provide a new perspective towards understanding the knowledge extraction mechanism within transformers.

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.

Abstract: The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be extended to other domains.

Abstract: Natural gradient methods significantly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), but are often prohibitively costly. We introduce a suite of techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of energy natural gradient descent (ENGD) for PINNs. First, we leverage the Woodbury formula to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of ENGD. Second, we adapt the Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent algorithm from the variational Monte Carlo literature to accelerate the convergence. Third, we explore the use of randomized algorithms to further reduce the computational cost in the case of large batch sizes. We find that randomization accelerates progress in the early stages of training for low-dimensional problems, and we identify key barriers to attaining acceleration in other scenarios. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform previous approaches, achieving the same $L^2$ error as the original ENGD up to $75\times$ faster.

Abstract: Large language models have recently made great strides in reasoning task performance through chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies trained via reinforcement learning; however, these "reasoning large language models" (RLLMs) remain imperfect reasoners, and understanding the frequencies and causes of their failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3 Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate edges not specified in the prompt's description of the graph. This phenomenon persists across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. Our results indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this weakness.

<title>FABLE: A Localized, Targeted Adversarial Attack on Weather Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based weather forecasting models have recently demonstrated significant performance improvements over gold-standard physics-based simulation tools. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we first investigate the feasibility of applying existing adversarial attack methods to weather forecasting models. We argue that a successful attack should (1) not modify significantly its original inputs, (2) be faithful, i.e., achieve the desired forecast at targeted locations with minimal changes to non-targeted locations, and (3) be geospatio-temporally realistic. However, balancing these criteria is a challenge as existing methods are not designed to preserve the geospatio-temporal dependencies of the original samples. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called FABLE (Forecast Alteration By Localized targeted advErsarial attack), which employs a 3D discrete wavelet decomposition to extract the varying components of the geospatio-temporal data. By regulating the magnitude of adversarial perturbations across different components, FABLE can generate adversarial inputs that maintain geospatio-temporal coherence while remaining faithful and closely aligned with the original inputs. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over baseline methods across various metrics.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms. Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to 50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation ("forgetting") mechanisms that are inherently coupled to the timescale of state evolution. As forgetting is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on multiple timescales. We analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under simple, flexible parameterizations. D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on long-range learning tasks, without introducing additional complexity, and simultaneously reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attacks pose a major threat to the security of large language models (LLMs), allowing adversaries to compromise safety guardrails with minimal harmful data. While existing defenses attempt to reinforce LLM alignment, they fail to address models' inherent "trainability" on harmful data, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attacks with increased learning rates or larger harmful datasets. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce SEAM, a novel alignment-enhancing defense that transforms LLMs into self-destructive models with intrinsic resilience to misalignment attempts. Specifically, these models retain their capabilities for legitimate tasks while exhibiting substantial performance degradation when fine-tuned on harmful data. The protection is achieved through a novel loss function that couples the optimization trajectories of benign and harmful data, enhanced with adversarial gradient ascent to amplify the self-destructive effect. To enable practical training, we develop an efficient Hessian-free gradient estimate with theoretical error bounds. Extensive evaluation across LLMs and datasets demonstrates that SEAM creates a no-win situation for adversaries: the self-destructive models achieve state-of-the-art robustness against low-intensity attacks and undergo catastrophic performance collapse under high-intensity attacks, rendering them effectively unusable. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

<title>BenSParX: A Robust Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Bengali Conversational Speech</title>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has been made publicly available at https://github.com/Riad071/BenSParX.

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism, and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of $\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$ denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$ simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

<title>Imagination-Limited Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning seeks to derive improved policies entirely from historical data but often struggles with over-optimistic value estimates for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This issue is typically mitigated via policy constraint or conservative value regularization methods. However, these approaches may impose overly constraints or biased value estimates, potentially limiting performance improvements. To balance exploitation and restriction, we propose an Imagination-Limited Q-learning (ILQ) method, which aims to maintain the optimism that OOD actions deserve within appropriate limits. Specifically, we utilize the dynamics model to imagine OOD action-values, and then clip the imagined values with the maximum behavior values. Such design maintains reasonable evaluation of OOD actions to the furthest extent, while avoiding its over-optimism. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed ILQ under tabular Markov decision processes. Particularly, we demonstrate that the error bound between estimated values and optimality values of OOD state-actions possesses the same magnitude as that of in-distribution ones, thereby indicating that the bias in value estimates is effectively mitigated. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: Suicide remains one of the main preventable causes of death among active service members and veterans. Early detection and prediction are crucial in suicide prevention. Machine learning techniques have yielded promising results in this area recently. This study aims to assess and summarize current research and provides a comprehensive review regarding the application of machine learning techniques in assessing and predicting suicidal ideation, attempts, and mortality among members of military and veteran populations.
  A keyword search using PubMed, IEEE, ACM, and Google Scholar was conducted, and the PRISMA protocol was adopted for relevant study selection. Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. These studies consistently identified risk factors relevant to mental health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, prior attempts, physical health problems, and demographic characteristics.
  Machine learning models applied in this area have demonstrated reasonable predictive accuracy. However, additional research gaps still exist. First, many studies have overlooked metrics that distinguish between false positives and negatives, such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value, which are crucial in the context of suicide prevention policies. Second, more dedicated approaches to handling survival and longitudinal data should be explored. Lastly, most studies focused on machine learning methods, with limited discussion of their connection to clinical rationales.
  In summary, machine learning analyses have identified a wide range of risk factors associated with suicide in military populations. The diversity and complexity of these factors also demonstrates that effective prevention strategies must be comprehensive and flexible.

<title>Reward Inside the Model: A Lightweight Hidden-State Reward Model for LLM's Best-of-N sampling</title>

Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs. In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to achieve additional performance gains.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning (CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.

Abstract: Kernelized attention extends the attention mechanism by modeling sequence correlations through kernel functions, making significant progresses in optimizing attention. Under the guarantee of harmonic analysis theory, kernel functions can be expanded with basis functions, inspiring random feature-based approaches to enhance the efficiency of kernelized attention while maintaining predictive performance. However, current random feature-based works are limited to the Fourier basis expansions under Bochner's theorem. We propose Schoenberg's theorem-based attention (SchoenbAt), which approximates dot-product kernelized attention with the polynomial basis under Schoenberg's theorem via random Maclaurin features and applies a two-stage regularization to constrain the input space and restore the output scale, acting as a drop-in replacement of dot-product kernelized attention. Our theoretical proof of the unbiasedness and concentration error bound of SchoenbAt supports its efficiency and accuracy as a kernelized attention approximation, which is also empirically validated under various random feature dimensions. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SchoenbAt significantly enhances computational speed while preserving competitive performance in terms of precision, outperforming several efficient attention methods.

Abstract: Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs, which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex knowledge setting.

Abstract: Power flow estimation plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and reliability of electrical power systems, particularly in the context of growing network complexities and renewable energy integration. However, existing studies often fail to adequately address the unique characteristics of power systems, such as the sparsity of network connections and the critical importance of the unique Slack node, which poses significant challenges in achieving high-accuracy estimations. In this paper, we present SenseFlow, a novel physics-informed and self-ensembling iterative framework that integrates two main designs, the Physics-Informed Power Flow Network (FlowNet) and Self-Ensembling Iterative Estimation (SeIter), to carefully address the unique properties of the power system and thereby enhance the power flow estimation. Specifically, SenseFlow enforces the FlowNet to gradually predict high-precision voltage magnitudes and phase angles through the iterative SeIter process. On the one hand, FlowNet employs the Virtual Node Attention and Slack-Gated Feed-Forward modules to facilitate efficient global-local communication in the face of network sparsity and amplify the influence of the Slack node on angle predictions, respectively. On the other hand, SeIter maintains an exponential moving average of FlowNet's parameters to create a robust ensemble model that refines power state predictions throughout the iterative fitting process. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseFlow outperforms existing methods, providing a promising solution for high-accuracy power flow estimation across diverse grid configurations.

Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients. Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies: task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities (e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings: ($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity, our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Graph structure learning is a core problem in graph-based machine learning, essential for uncovering latent relationships and ensuring model interpretability. However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx: a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved scalability.

Abstract: The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances. This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple, scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations by drawing inspiration from the classical Graduated Assignment (GA) technique. Central to NGA is stacking of neural components that closely resemble the GA process, but with the reparameterization of learnable temperature into higher dimension. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA, showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES and offers insights into other assignment problems.

<title>Mitigating Hallucinations via Inter-Layer Consistency Aggregation in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they remain susceptible to hallucinations-generating content that is inconsistent with the input image. Existing training-free hallucination mitigation methods often suffer from unstable performance and high sensitivity to hyperparameter settings, limiting their practicality and broader adoption. In this paper, we propose a novel decoding mechanism, Decoding with Inter-layer Consistency via Layer Aggregation (DCLA), which requires no retraining, fine-tuning, or access to external knowledge bases. Specifically, our approach constructs a dynamic semantic reference by aggregating representations from previous layers, and corrects semantically deviated layers to enforce inter-layer consistency. The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate hallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks such as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.

arXiv:2505.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While norm-based and leverage-score-based methods have been extensively studied for identifying "important" data points in linear models, analogous tools for nonlinear models remain significantly underdeveloped. By introducing the concept of the adjoint operator of a nonlinear map, we address this gap and generalize norm-based and leverage-score-based importance sampling to nonlinear settings. We demonstrate that sampling based on these generalized notions of norm and leverage scores provides approximation guarantees for the underlying nonlinear mapping, similar to linear subspace embeddings. As direct applications, these nonlinear scores not only reduce the computational complexity of training nonlinear models by enabling efficient sampling over large datasets but also offer a novel mechanism for model explainability and outlier detection. Our contributions are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental results across a variety of supervised learning scenarios.

arXiv:2505.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement learning architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather, binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1% without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive online RL regimes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy, focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention. However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation, especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.

arXiv:2505.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However, existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE) subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks, including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing reward models.

Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Abstract: The Saint-Venant torsion theory is a classical theory for analyzing the torsional behavior of structural components, and it remains critically important in modern computational design workflows. Conventional numerical methods, including the finite element method (FEM), typically rely on mesh-based approaches to obtain approximate solutions. However, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive techniques to overcome the limitations of approximation, leading to significant increases in computational cost. The objective of this study is to develop a series of novel numerical methods based on physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving the Saint-Venant torsion equations. Utilizing the expressive power and the automatic differentiation capability of neural networks, the PINN can solve partial differential equations (PDEs) along with boundary conditions without the need for intricate computational techniques. First, a PINN solver was developed to compute the torsional constant for bars with arbitrary cross-sectional geometries. This was followed by the development of a solver capable of handling cases with sharp geometric transitions; variable-scaling PINN (VS-PINN). Finally, a parametric PINN was constructed to address the limitations of conventional single-instance PINN. The results from all three solvers showed good agreement with reference solutions, demonstrating their accuracy and robustness. Each solver can be selectively utilized depending on the specific requirements of torsional behavior analysis.

Abstract: Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted. Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model, removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50 seconds using 4-5 images.

<title>Hyperbolic Residual Quantization: Discrete Representations for Data with Latent Hierarchies</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching, necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture latent hierarchies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.

Abstract: Understanding the convergence points and optimization landscape of neural networks is crucial, particularly for homogeneous networks where Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the associated maximum-margin problem often characterize solutions. This paper investigates the relationship between such KKT points across networks of different widths generated via neuron splitting. We introduce and formalize the \textbf{KKT point embedding principle}, establishing that KKT points of a homogeneous network's max-margin problem ($P_{\Phi}$) can be embedded into the KKT points of a larger network's problem ($P_{\tilde{\Phi}}$) via specific linear isometric transformations corresponding to neuron splitting. We rigorously prove this principle holds for neuron splitting in both two-layer and deep homogeneous networks. Furthermore, we connect this static embedding to the dynamics of gradient flow training with smooth losses. We demonstrate that trajectories initiated from appropriately mapped points remain mapped throughout training and that the resulting $\omega$-limit sets of directions are correspondingly mapped ($T(L(\theta(0))) = L(\boldsymbol{\eta}(0))$), thereby preserving the alignment with KKT directions dynamically when directional convergence occurs. Our findings offer insights into the effects of network width, parameter redundancy, and the structural connections between solutions found via optimization in homogeneous networks of varying sizes.

Fixed point explanations satisfy properties like minimality, stability, and faithfulness, revealing hidden model behaviours and explanatory weaknesses. We define convergence conditions for several classes of explainers, from feature-based to mechanistic tools like Sparse AutoEncoders, and we report quantitative and qualitative results.

Abstract: Recently, innovative adaptations of the Ritz Method incorporating deep learning have been developed, known as the Deep Ritz Method. This approach employs a neural network as the test function for variational problems. However, the neural network does not inherently satisfy the boundary conditions of the variational problem. To resolve this issue, the Deep Ritz Method introduces a penalty term into the functional of the variational problem, which can lead to misleading results during the optimization process. In this work, an ansatz is proposed that inherently satisfies the boundary conditions of the variational problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed ansatz not only eliminates misleading outcomes but also reduces complexity while maintaining accuracy, showcasing its practical effectiveness in addressing variational problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end, we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint, alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies, highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/zrguo/Observe-R1.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is broadly utilized for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values because of its flexibility. Despite its effectiveness, it has been observed that the capability of DPO to generate human-preferred response is limited and the results of DPO are far from resilient. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, i.e., SGDPO, which incorporates a pilot term to steer the gradient flow during the optimization process, allowing for fine-grained control over the updates of chosen and rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed method and elucidate its operational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments on various models and benchmarks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistency between the empirical results and our theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach (up to 9.19% higher score).

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both 15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000 additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.

<title>AltLoRA: Towards Better Gradient Approximation in Low-Rank Adaptation with Alternating Projections</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design, approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost. In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design, meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.

<title>UFO-RL: Uncertainty-Focused Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning Data Selection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training, reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.

<title>A Case for Library-Level k-Means Binning in Histogram Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12460</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12460</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from O(N) to O(B) given a fixed bin budget B. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy-designed to distribute data points evenly among bins-may overlook critical boundary values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we propose replacing quantile binning with a k-means discretizer initialized with quantile bins. We test this swap on 33 OpenML tasks plus synthetics that control for modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in four cases-most strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15 classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs 0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large MSE gains-typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exact splitting when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the 32-64-bin GPU regime-because it is a "safe default" with large upside, yet adds only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 2s to bin 10M rows on one core).

<title>A Finite-Sample Analysis of Distributionally Robust Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is crucial for long-term decision making under potential environment mismatches, yet its finite-sample complexity study remains largely unexplored. Existing works offer algorithms with asymptotic guarantees, but the absence of finite-sample analysis hinders its principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited settings. We close this gap by proposing Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI), the first algorithm with provable finite-sample complexity guarantee. Under standard uncertainty sets -- including contamination sets and $\ell_p$-norm balls -- RHI attains an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with near-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result gives the first polynomial sample complexity guarantee for robust average-reward RL. Moreover, our RHI's independence from prior knowledge distinguishes it from many previous average-reward RL studies. Our work thus constitutes a significant advancement in enhancing the practical applicability of robust average-reward methods to complex, real-world problems.

<title>Resolving Latency and Inventory Risk in Market Making with Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12465</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latency of the exchanges in Market Making (MM) is inevitable due to hardware limitations, system processing times, delays in receiving data from exchanges, the time required for order transmission to reach the market, etc. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods for Market Making (MM) overlook the impact of these latency, which can lead to unintended order cancellations due to price discrepancies between decision and execution times and result in undesired inventory accumulation, exposing MM traders to increased market risk. Therefore, these methods cannot be applied in real MM scenarios. To address these issues, we first build a realistic MM environment with random delays of 30-100 milliseconds for order placement and market information reception, and implement a batch matching mechanism that collects orders within every 500 milliseconds before matching them all at once, simulating the batch auction mechanisms adopted by some exchanges. Then, we propose Relaver, an RL-based method for MM to tackle the latency and inventory risk issues. The three main contributions of Relaver are: i) we introduce an augmented state-action space that incorporates order hold time alongside price and volume, enabling Relaver to optimize execution strategies under latency constraints and time-priority matching mechanisms, ii) we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to guide the exploration of RL training for better policies, iii) we train a market trend predictor, which can guide the agent to intelligently adjust the inventory to reduce the risk. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Relaver} significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art RL-based MM strategies across multiple metrics.

<title>Joint Embedding vs Reconstruction: Provable Benefits of Latent Space Prediction for Self Supervised Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.

<title>$\gamma$-FedHT: Stepsize-Aware Hard-Threshold Gradient Compression in Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12479</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient compression can effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks in Federated Learning (FL). Contemporary state-of-the-art sparse compressors, such as Top-$k$, exhibit high computational complexity, up to $\mathcal{O}(d\log_2{k})$, where $d$ is the number of model parameters. The hard-threshold compressor, which simply transmits elements with absolute values higher than a fixed threshold, is thus proposed to reduce the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(d)$. However, the hard-threshold compression causes accuracy degradation in FL, where the datasets are non-IID and the stepsize $\gamma$ is decreasing for model convergence. The decaying stepsize reduces the updates and causes the compression ratio of the hard-threshold compression to drop rapidly to an aggressive ratio. At or below this ratio, the model accuracy has been observed to degrade severely. To address this, we propose $\gamma$-FedHT, a stepsize-aware low-cost compressor with Error-Feedback to guarantee convergence. Given that the traditional theoretical framework of FL does not consider Error-Feedback, we introduce the fundamental conversation of Error-Feedback. We prove that $\gamma$-FedHT has the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ ($T$ representing total training iterations) under $\mu$-strongly convex cases and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ under non-convex cases, \textit{same as FedAVG}. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\gamma$-FedHT improves accuracy by up to $7.42\%$ over Top-$k$ under equal communication traffic on various non-IID image datasets.

<title>CPGD: Toward Stable Rule-based Reinforcement Learning for Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly improved the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) with rule-based rewards. However, existing RL methods -- such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and RLOO -- often suffer from training instability, where large policy updates and improper clipping can lead to training collapse. To address this issue, we propose Clipped Policy Gradient Optimization with Policy Drift (CPGD), a novel algorithm designed to stabilize policy learning in LMs. CPGD introduces a policy drift constraint based on KL divergence to dynamically regularize policy updates, and leverages a clip mechanism on the logarithm of the ratio to prevent excessive policy updates. We provide theoretical justification for CPGD and demonstrate through empirical analysis that it mitigates the instability observed in prior approaches. Furthermore, we show that CPGD significantly improves performance while maintaining training stability. Our implementation balances theoretical rigor with practical usability, offering a robust alternative for RL in the post-training of LMs. We release our code at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments. In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel ``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and generalizing across environments without access to labels.

<title>InnateCoder: Learning Programmatic Options with Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Outside of transfer learning settings, reinforcement learning agents start their learning process from a clean slate. As a result, such agents have to go through a slow process to learn even the most obvious skills required to solve a problem. In this paper, we present InnateCoder, a system that leverages human knowledge encoded in foundation models to provide programmatic policies that encode "innate skills" in the form of temporally extended actions, or options. In contrast to existing approaches to learning options, InnateCoder learns them from the general human knowledge encoded in foundation models in a zero-shot setting, and not from the knowledge the agent gains by interacting with the environment. Then, InnateCoder searches for a programmatic policy by combining the programs encoding these options into larger and more complex programs. We hypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve the sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies. Empirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since they show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system that do not use options or learn them from experience.

<title>Towards Budget-Friendly Model-Agnostic Explanation Generation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced, model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly models.

<title>Scalable Strategies for Continual Learning with Replay</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively. Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks. In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.

Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) on Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices offers numerous advantages over cloud-based processing. However, such devices face substantial energy constraints to prolong battery-life, or may even operate intermittently via energy-harvesting. Consequently, \textit{energy-aware} approaches for optimizing DL inference and training on such resource-constrained devices have garnered recent interest. We present an overview of such approaches, outlining their methodologies, implications for energy consumption and system-level efficiency, and their limitations in terms of supported network types, hardware platforms, and application scenarios. We hope our review offers a clear synthesis of the evolving energy-aware DL landscape and serves as a foundation for future research in energy-constrained computing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), while being accurate, face significant training inefficiencies due to irregular supervision signals in dynamic graphs, which induce sparse gradient updates. We first theoretically establish that aggregating historical node interactions into pseudo-labels reduces gradient variance, accelerating convergence. Building on this analysis, we propose History-Averaged Labels (HAL), a method that dynamically enriches training batches with pseudo-targets derived from historical label distributions. HAL ensures continuous parameter updates without architectural modifications by converting idle computation into productive learning steps. Experiments on the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) validate our findings and an assumption about slow change of user preferences: HAL accelerates TGNv2 training by up to 15x while maintaining competitive performance. Thus, this work offers an efficient, lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and theoretically motivated solution to label sparsity in temporal graph learning.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has become a critical concern, particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing approaches often focus on achieving full fairness across all score ranges generated by predictive models, ensuring fairness in both high and low-scoring populations. However, this stringent requirement can compromise predictive performance and may not align with the practical fairness concerns of stakeholders. In this work, we propose a novel framework for building partially fair machine learning models, which enforce fairness within a specific score range of interest, such as the middle range where decisions are most contested, while maintaining flexibility in other regions. We introduce two statistical metrics to rigorously evaluate partial fairness within a given score range, such as the top 20%-40% of scores. To achieve partial fairness, we propose an in-processing method by formulating the model training problem as constrained optimization with difference-of-convex constraints, which can be solved by an inexact difference-of-convex algorithm (IDCA). We provide the complexity analysis of IDCA for finding a nearly KKT point. Through numerical experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our framework achieves high predictive performance while enforcing partial fairness where it matters most.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success across scientific domains, yet their impact in chemistry remains limited due to the absence of diverse, large-scale, high-quality datasets that reflect the field's multifaceted nature. We present the ChemPile, an open dataset containing over 75 billion tokens of curated chemical data, specifically built for training and evaluating general-purpose models in the chemical sciences. The dataset mirrors the human learning journey through chemistry -- from educational foundations to specialized expertise -- spanning multiple modalities and content types including structured data in diverse chemical representations (SMILES, SELFIES, IUPAC names, InChI, molecular renderings), scientific and educational text, executable code, and chemical images. ChemPile integrates foundational knowledge (textbooks, lecture notes), specialized expertise (scientific articles and language-interfaced data), visual understanding (molecular structures, diagrams), and advanced reasoning (problem-solving traces and code) -- mirroring how human chemists develop expertise through diverse learning materials and experiences. Constructed through hundreds of hours of expert curation, the ChemPile captures both foundational concepts and domain-specific complexity. We provide standardized training, validation, and test splits, enabling robust benchmarking. ChemPile is openly released via HuggingFace with a consistent API, permissive license, and detailed documentation. We hope the ChemPile will serve as a catalyst for chemical AI, enabling the development of the next generation of chemical foundation models.

arXiv:2505.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures, parameter counts, and training datasets.
  The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for classification and attribute inference.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for differentially private (DP) statistical estimation via data truncation, addressing a key challenge in DP estimation when the data support is unbounded. Traditional approaches rely on problem-specific sensitivity analysis, limiting their applicability. By leveraging techniques from truncated statistics, we develop computationally efficient DP estimators for exponential family distributions, including Gaussian mean and covariance estimation, achieving near-optimal sample complexity. Previous works on exponential families only consider bounded or one-dimensional families. Our approach mitigates sensitivity through truncation while carefully correcting for the introduced bias using maximum likelihood estimation and DP stochastic gradient descent. Along the way, we establish improved uniform convergence guarantees for the log-likelihood function of exponential families, which may be of independent interest. Our results provide a general blueprint for DP algorithm design via truncated statistics.

Abstract: Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.

Abstract: Real-world systems, from aerospace to railway engineering, are modeled with partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the physics of the system. Estimating robust solutions for such problems is essential. Deep learning-based architectures, such as neural PDE solvers, have recently gained traction as a reliable solution method. The current state of development of these approaches, however, primarily focuses on improving accuracy. The environmental impact of excessive computation, leading to increased carbon emissions, has largely been overlooked. This paper introduces a carbon emission measure for a range of PDE solvers. Our proposed metric, EcoL2, balances model accuracy with emissions across data collection, model training, and deployment. Experiments across both physics-informed machine learning and operator learning architectures demonstrate that the proposed metric presents a holistic assessment of model performance and emission cost. As such solvers grow in scale and deployment, EcoL2 represents a step toward building performant scientific machine learning systems with lower long-term environmental impact.

<title>HybridServe: Efficient Serving of Large AI Models with Confidence-Based Cascade Routing</title>

arXiv:2505.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become indispensable for accurate and robust support of large-scale cloud based AI services. However, serving giant DNNs is prohibitively expensive from an energy consumption viewpoint easily exceeding that of training, due to the enormous scale of GPU clusters needed to hold giant DNN model partitions and replicas. Existing approaches can either optimize energy efficiency or inference accuracy but not both. To overcome this status quo, we propose HybridServe, a novel hybrid DNN model serving system that leverages multiple sized versions (small to giant) of the model to be served in tandem. Through a confidence based hybrid model serving dataflow, HybridServe prefers to serve inference requests with energy-efficient smaller models so long as accuracy is not compromised, thereby reducing the number of replicas needed for giant DNNs. HybridServe also features a dataflow planner for efficient partitioning and replication of candidate models to maximize serving system throughput. Experimental results using a prototype implementation of HybridServe show that it reduces energy footprint by up to 19.8x compared to the state-of-the-art DNN model serving systems while matching the accuracy of serving solely with giant DNNs.

<title>AdaDim: Dimensionality Adaptation for SSL Representational Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high $H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a highly effective approach for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks with minimal computational overhead. At the core, PEFT methods freeze most parameters and only trains a small subset (say $<0.1\%$ of total parameters). Notably, different PEFT methods select different subsets, resulting in varying levels of performance. This variation prompts a key question: how to effectively select the most influential subset to train?
  We formulate the subset selection as a multi-task problem: maximizing the performance and minimizing the number of trainable parameters. We leverage a series of transformations -- including $\epsilon$-constraint method and second-order Taylor approximation -- to arrive at the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, which we solve through the lens of Pareto optimality. Consequently, we propose AdaPEFT, a Hessian-informed PEFT that adapts to various tasks and models, in which the selected subset empirically transfers across training horizons and model sizes.

<title>An approach based on class activation maps for investigating the effects of data augmentation on neural networks for image classification</title>

Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting. Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies. Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.

<title>Learning Robust Spectral Dynamics for Temporal Domain Generalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models struggle to maintain performance in dynamic environments where temporal distribution shifts, \emph{i.e., concept drift}, are prevalent. Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model generalization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically assume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts involving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which tackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter trajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter evolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component with dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator, robustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and periodicity. Simultaneously, potentially disruptive high-frequency variations are smoothed via targeted temporal regularization, preventing overfitting to transient noise and domain uncertainties. In addition, this dual spectral strategy is rigorously grounded through theoretical analysis, providing stability guarantees for the Koopman prediction, a principled Bayesian justification for the high-frequency regularization, and culminating in a multiscale generalization bound connecting spectral dynamics to improved generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate FreKoo's significant superiority over SOTA TDG approaches, particularly excelling in real-world streaming scenarios with complex drifts and uncertainties.

<title>A Few Large Shifts: Layer-Inconsistency Based Minimal Overhead Adversarial Example Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex architectures, heavy augmentations, or adversarial data, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial perturbations typically induce large representation shifts in a small subset of layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with negligible computational overhead and no compromise to clean accuracy.

<title>Rethinking Predictive Modeling for LLM Routing: When Simple kNN Beats Complex Learned Routers</title>

arXiv:2505.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and specialization, routing--selecting the best model for a given input--has become essential for efficient and effective deployment. While recent methods rely on complex learned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and evaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work, we revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a well-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often outperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks spanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as well as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs. Our findings reveal that the locality properties of model performance in embedding space enable simple non-parametric methods to achieve strong routing decisions with lower sample complexity than parametric approaches. This challenges the prevailing trend toward sophisticated architectures and highlights the importance of thoroughly evaluating simple baselines before investing in complex solutions. To support reproducibility and further exploration, we will release all benchmarks and code upon publication.

<title>Action-Dependent Optimality-Preserving Reward Shaping</title>

arXiv:2505.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent RL research has utilized reward shaping--particularly complex shaping rewards such as intrinsic motivation (IM)--to encourage agent exploration in sparse-reward environments. While often effective, ``reward hacking'' can lead to the shaping reward being optimized at the expense of the extrinsic reward, resulting in a suboptimal policy. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) techniques such as Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) and Policy-Invariant Explicit Shaping (PIES) have mitigated this. These methods allow for implementing IM without altering optimal policies. In this work we show that they are effectively unsuitable for complex, exploration-heavy environments with long-duration episodes. To remedy this, we introduce Action-Dependent Optimality Preserving Shaping (ADOPS), a method of converting intrinsic rewards to an optimality-preserving form that allows agents to utilize IM more effectively in the extremely sparse environment of Montezuma's Revenge. We also prove ADOPS accommodates reward shaping functions that cannot be written in a potential-based form: while PBRS-based methods require the cumulative discounted intrinsic return be independent of actions, ADOPS allows for intrinsic cumulative returns to be dependent on agents' actions while still preserving the optimal policy set. We show how action-dependence enables ADOPS's to preserve optimality while learning in complex, sparse-reward environments where other methods struggle.

arXiv:2505.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and unlearning capability.

Abstract: Feature generation involves creating new features from raw data to capture complex relationships among the original features, improving model robustness and machine learning performance. Current methods using reinforcement learning for feature generation have made feature exploration more flexible and efficient. However, several challenges remain: first, during feature expansion, a large number of redundant features are generated. When removing them, current methods only retain the best features each round, neglecting those that perform poorly initially but could improve later. Second, the state representation used by current methods fails to fully capture complex feature relationships. Third, there are significant differences between discrete and continuous features in tabular data, requiring different operations for each type. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-agent reinforcement learning method for feature generation. Two agents are designed: the first generates new features, and the second determines whether they should be preserved. A self-attention mechanism enhances state representation, and diverse operations distinguish interactions between discrete and continuous features. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The code is available at https://github.com/extess0/DARL.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the adaptability of LLMs.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) can automatically construct intelligent agents, deep neural networks (alternatively, DL models), that can outperform humans in certain tasks. However, the operating principles of DL remain poorly understood, making its decisions incomprehensible. As a result, it poses a great risk to deploy DL in high-stakes domains in which mistakes or errors may lead to critical consequences. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm that can help DL models make more robust decisions by allowing them to abstain from answering when they are uncertain. Our algorithm, named `Two out of Three (ToT)', is inspired by the sensitivity of the human brain to conflicting information. ToT creates two alternative predictions in addition to the original model prediction and uses the alternative predictions to decide whether it should provide an answer or not.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool that can solve complex problems, and thus, it seems natural to assume that DL can be used to enhance the security of wireless communication. However, deploying DL models to edge devices in wireless networks is challenging, as they require significant amounts of computing and power resources. Notably, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are known to be efficient in terms of power consumption, meaning they can be an alternative platform for DL models for edge devices. In this study, we ask if SNNs can be used in physical layer authentication. Our evaluation suggests that SNNs can learn unique physical properties (i.e., `fingerprints') of RF transmitters and use them to identify individual devices. Furthermore, we find that SNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that an autoencoder can be used clean out adversarial perturbations to harden SNNs against them.

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.
  To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.

Abstract: Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training, improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home -- demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: AI developers are releasing large language models (LLMs) under a variety of different licenses. Many of these licenses restrict the ways in which the models or their outputs may be used. This raises the question how license violations may be recognized. In particular, how can we identify that an API or product uses (an adapted version of) a particular LLM? We present a new method that enable model developers to perform such identification via fingerprints: statistical patterns that are unique to the developer's model and robust to common alterations of that model. Our method permits model identification in a black-box setting using a limited number of queries, enabling identification of models that can only be accessed via an API or product. The fingerprints are non-invasive: our method does not require any changes to the model during training, hence by design, it does not impact model quality. Empirically, we find our method provides a high degree of robustness to common changes in the model or inference settings. In our experiments, it substantially outperforms prior art, including invasive methods that explicitly train watermarks into the model.

Abstract: Key feature fields need bigger embedding dimensionality, others need smaller. This demands automated dimension allocation. Existing approaches, such as pruning or Neural Architecture Search (NAS), require training a memory-intensive SuperNet that enumerates all possible dimension combinations, which is infeasible for large feature spaces. We propose DimGrow, a lightweight approach that eliminates the SuperNet requirement. Starting training model from one dimension per feature field, DimGrow can progressively expand/shrink dimensions via importance scoring. Dimensions grow only when their importance consistently exceed a threshold, ensuring memory efficiency. Experiments on three recommendation datasets verify the effectiveness of DimGrow while it reduces training memory compared to SuperNet-based methods.

<title>Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.

<title>RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations</title>

Abstract: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat.
  In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.

<title>Counterfactual Explanations for Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in domains like healthcare and robotics but often struggles with adoption due to its lack of interpretability. Counterfactual explanations, which address "what if" scenarios, provide a promising avenue for understanding RL decisions but remain underexplored for continuous action spaces. We propose a novel approach for generating counterfactual explanations in continuous action RL by computing alternative action sequences that improve outcomes while minimizing deviations from the original sequence. Our approach leverages a distance metric for continuous actions and accounts for constraints such as adhering to predefined policies in specific states. Evaluations in two RL domains, Diabetes Control and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization of our approach, enabling more interpretable and trustworthy RL applications.

Abstract: Advances in deep generative modelling have made it increasingly plausible to train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.

<title>Pave Your Own Path: Graph Gradual Domain Adaptation on Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Geodesics</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks, despite their impressive performance, are highly vulnerable to distribution shifts on graphs. Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with \textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to \textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node classification accuracy on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles, users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs, thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber attacks.

Abstract: The development of edge computing places critical demands on energy-efficient model deployment for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection tasks. Deploying deep unfolding models such as PGD-Nets and ADMM-Nets into resource-constrained edge devices using quantization methods is challenging. Existing quantization methods based on quantization aware training (QAT) suffer from performance degradation due to their reliance on parametric distribution assumption of activations and static quantization step sizes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based adaptive quantization (KAQ) framework for deep unfolding networks. By utilizing a joint kernel density estimation (KDE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) approach to align activation distributions between full-precision and quantized models, the need for prior distribution assumptions is eliminated. Additionally, a dynamic step size updating method is introduced to adjust the quantization step size based on the channel conditions of wireless networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of proposed KAQ framework outperforms traditional methods and successfully reduces the model's inference latency.

<title>Option-aware Temporally Abstracted Value for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical learning paradigm where goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant unlabeled (reward-free) datasets without additional environment interaction. However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. By identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following insights: First, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Second, when learning the high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage signal frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function to produce a clear advantage signal for learning the high-level policy is essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, the proposed learning scheme contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that the high-level policy extracted using the OTA value function achieves strong performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation environments.

Abstract: Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of LLMs.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a popular tool for single source domain generalization, which expands the source domain by generating simulated ones, improving generalization on unseen target domains. In this work, we show that the performance of such augmentation-based methods in the target domains universally fluctuates during training, posing challenges in model selection under realistic scenarios. We argue that the fluctuation stems from the inability of the model to accumulate the knowledge learned from diverse augmentations, exacerbating feature distortion during training. Based on this observation, we propose a novel generalization method, coined Parameter-Space Ensemble with Entropy Regularization (PEER), that uses a proxy model to learn the augmented data on behalf of the main model. The main model is updated by averaging its parameters with the proxy model, progressively accumulating knowledge over the training steps. Maximizing the mutual information between the output representations of the two models guides the learning process of the proxy model, mitigating feature distortion during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEER in reducing the OOD performance fluctuation and enhancing generalization across various datasets, including PACS, Digits, Office-Home, and VLCS. Notably, our method with simple random augmentation achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior approaches on sDG that utilize complex data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data. MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.

Abstract: Instruction data selection aims to identify a high-quality subset from the training set that matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset on target tasks. Existing methods focus on the instruction-to-response mapping, but neglect the human preference for diverse responses. In this paper, we propose Preference-oriented Data Selection method (ProDS) that scores training samples based on their alignment with preferences observed in the target set. Our key innovation lies in shifting the data selection criteria from merely estimating features for accurate response generation to explicitly aligning training samples with human preferences in target tasks. Specifically, direct preference optimization (DPO) is employed to estimate human preferences across diverse responses. Besides, a bidirectional preference synthesis strategy is designed to score training samples according to both positive preferences and negative preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our superiority to existing task-agnostic and targeted methods.

<title>Your Offline Policy is Not Trustworthy: Bilevel Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Portfolio Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant promise for sequential portfolio optimization tasks, such as stock trading, where the objective is to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing risks using historical data. However, traditional RL approaches often produce policies that merely memorize the optimal yet impractical buying and selling behaviors within the fixed dataset. These offline policies are less generalizable as they fail to account for the non-stationary nature of the market. Our approach, MetaTrader, frames portfolio optimization as a new type of partial-offline RL problem and makes two technical contributions. First, MetaTrader employs a bilevel learning framework that explicitly trains the RL agent to improve both in-domain profits on the original dataset and out-of-domain performance across diverse transformations of the raw financial data. Second, our approach incorporates a new temporal difference (TD) method that approximates worst-case TD estimates from a batch of transformed TD targets, addressing the value overestimation issue that is particularly challenging in scenarios with limited offline data. Our empirical results on two public stock datasets show that MetaTrader outperforms existing methods, including both RL-based approaches and traditional stock prediction models.

<title>Enhancing Channel-Independent Time-Series Forecasting via Cross-Variate Patch Embedding</title>

Abstract: Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However, existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy. The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However, we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.

<title>FedSVD: Adaptive Orthogonalization for Private Federated Learning with LoRA</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients, and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result, FedSVD consistently improves stability and performance across a variety of privacy settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines under both private and non-private regimes.

Abstract: This paper explores a simple question: can we model the internal transformations of a neural network using dynamical systems theory? We introduce Koopman autoencoders to capture how neural representations evolve through network layers, treating these representations as states in a dynamical system. Our approach learns a surrogate model that predicts how neural representations transform from input to output, with two key advantages. First, by way of lifting the original states via an autoencoder, it operates in a linear space, making editing the dynamics straightforward. Second, it preserves the topologies of the original representations by regularizing the autoencoding objective. We demonstrate that these surrogate models naturally replicate the progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks. As a practical application, we show how our approach enables targeted class unlearning in the Yin-Yang and MNIST classification tasks.

Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly detector valued for its exceptional runtime efficiency and performance on large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper theoretically investigates the conditions and extent of iForest's effectiveness by analyzing its inductive bias through the formulation of depth functions and growth processes. Since directly analyzing the depth function proves intractable due to iForest's random splitting mechanism, we model the growth process of iForest as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function using transition probabilities. Our case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor anomaly detectors. Our study provides theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward. Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias. Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms, our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces verbosity without compromising its performance.

Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles, play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the trained network.

<title>PhyDA: Physics-Guided Diffusion Models for Data Assimilation in Atmospheric Systems</title>

Abstract: Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.

<title>TinyAlign: Boosting Lightweight Vision-Language Models by Mitigating Modal Alignment Bottlenecks</title>

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

<title>Efficient training for large-scale optical neural network using an evolutionary strategy and attention pruning</title>

Abstract: MZI-based block optical neural networks (BONNs), which can achieve large-scale network models, have increasingly drawn attentions. However, the robustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough. Moreover, large-scale BONNs usually contain numerous trainable parameters, resulting in expensive computation and power consumption. In this article, by pruning matrix blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327% for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5) exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover, when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5% accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.

<title>Sinusoidal Initialization, Time for a New Start</title>

Abstract: Initialization plays a critical role in Deep Neural Network training, directly influencing convergence, stability, and generalization. Common approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.8 % in final validation accuracy and 20.9 % in convergence speed. By replacing randomness with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable foundation for Deep Learning systems.

Abstract: Exhaustive virtual screening is highly informative but often intractable against the expensive objective functions involved in modern drug discovery. This problem is exacerbated in combinatorial contexts such as multi-vector expansion, where molecular spaces can quickly become ultra-large. Here, we introduce Scalable Active Learning via Synthon Acquisition (SALSA): a simple algorithm applicable to multi-vector expansion which extends pool-based active learning to non-enumerable spaces by factoring modeling and acquisition over synthon or fragment choices. Through experiments on ligand- and structure-based objectives, we highlight SALSA's sample efficiency, and its ability to scale to spaces of trillions of compounds. Further, we demonstrate application toward multi-parameter objective design tasks on three protein targets - finding SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known bioactives, and exhibit greater diversity and higher scores over an industry-leading generative approach.

<title>Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet.

<title>RGNMR: A Gauss-Newton method for robust matrix completion with theoretical guarantees</title>

Abstract: Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.

<title>Leveraging LLM Inconsistency to Boost Pass@k Performance</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

<title>Multi-Level Monte Carlo Training of Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: Operator learning is a rapidly growing field that aims to approximate nonlinear operators related to partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural operators. These rely on discretization of input and output functions and are, usually, expensive to train for large-scale problems at high-resolution. Motivated by this, we present a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach to train neural operators by leveraging a hierarchy of resolutions of function dicretization. Our framework relies on using gradient corrections from fewer samples of fine-resolution data to decrease the computational cost of training while maintaining a high level accuracy. The proposed MLMC training procedure can be applied to any architecture accepting multi-resolution data. Our numerical experiments on a range of state-of-the-art models and test-cases demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to traditional single-resolution training approaches, and highlight the existence of a Pareto curve between accuracy and computational time, related to the number of samples per resolution.

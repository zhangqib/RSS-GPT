Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 {\deg}C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 {\deg}C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.

<div> Keywords: invertible problems, large language models, lossless encoding, hardware description language, design verification<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses invertible problems where data is transformed between a source domain, such as Logic Condition Tables (LCTs), and a destination domain, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) code. The authors propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as lossless encoders and decoders, effectively treating the LLMs like compression tools that can translate from source to destination and back without data loss. This method helps to reduce common issues with LLMs, including hallucinations and omissions during code generation. The approach is demonstrated by generating complete HDL code for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router from LCT inputs using seven different LLMs. They then reconstructed the original LCTs from this auto-generated HDL and compared them to the originals. Results show that this technique not only confirms correctly generated logic and detects errors in the LLM output but also enhances productivity by assisting developers in identifying specification mistakes. The study highlights the potential of LLMs as reliable, reversible translators between complex technical domains, improving accuracy and confidence in automated code generation workflows. <div>

Abstract: We show for invertible problems that transform data from a source domain (for example, Logic Condition Tables (LCTs)) to a destination domain (for example, Hardware Description Language (HDL) code), an approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lossless encoder from source to destination followed by as a lossless decoder back to the source, comparable to lossless compression in information theory, can mitigate most of the LLM drawbacks of hallucinations and omissions. Specifically, using LCTs as inputs, we generate the full HDL for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router (13 units, 1500-2000 lines of code) using seven different LLMs, reconstruct the LCTs from the auto-generated HDL, and compare the original and reconstructed LCTs. This approach yields significant productivity improvements, not only confirming correctly generated LLM logic and detecting incorrectly generated LLM logic but also assisting developers in finding design specification errors.

<div> Federated Learning, Green AI, adaptive layer-freezing, MRI-to-CT conversion, energy efficiency<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple healthcare institutions to collaboratively train deep learning models without sharing data, helping advance equality in health.  
2. FL's high computational and energy demands tend to exclude centers with limited resources, potentially worsening healthcare disparities.  
3. The authors propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy that reduces energy consumption and computational load during federated training while preserving model quality.  
4. Their approach selectively freezes encoder weights based on the relative weight changes between training rounds, using a patience mechanism to ensure freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently small.  
5. This method was applied to various federated architectures aimed at converting MRI images to CT images.  
6. Using the CodeCarbon library, they monitored energy use and CO2 equivalent emissions, finding reductions of up to 23% in training time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions compared to non-frozen training.  
7. The MRI-to-CT conversion performance, measured by Mean Absolute Error, was maintained with minimal variation; three of five architectures showed no statistically significant differences, while two showed significant improvements.  
8. This work supports the development of sustainable, equitable, and privacy-preserving AI models in healthcare, aligning clinical performance with environmental and social responsibility.  
9. It establishes a foundation for new evaluation frameworks in federated learning, promoting justice and equity in AI-driven medical applications. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds the potential to advance equality in health by enabling diverse institutions to collaboratively train deep learning (DL) models, even with limited data. However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability. It lays the groundwork for novel FL evaluation frameworks, advancing privacy, equity and, more broadly, justice in AI-driven healthcare.

<div> Keywords: cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, physics-informed learning, graph neural networks, fractional flow reserve  

<br><br>Summary:  
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with coronary artery disease (CAD) as the most common form, emphasizing the need for early risk prediction. Traditional assessment methods using 3D coronary artery digital twins rely heavily on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is computationally expensive and limits widespread application. Data-driven approaches face challenges due to limited labeled clinical data and the lack of integrated physiological knowledge. To overcome these barriers, the study introduces PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins. The model incorporates physical laws such as the 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop relationships, thereby eliminating the dependency on CFD simulations and labeled datasets. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD achieves an AUC of 0.73 in predicting future cardiovascular events, exceeding the performance of standard clinical risk scores and purely data-driven models. The framework also produces spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable, physiologically meaningful biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD enables a scalable, simulation-free, and physiology-aware analysis of routine angiography, advancing preventive cardiology practices. <div>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of mortality, with coronary artery disease (CAD) as its most prevalent form, necessitating early risk prediction. While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.

<title>Delta Sampling: Data-Free Knowledge Transfer Across Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03056</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03056</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Diffusion Models, Stable Diffusion, Knowledge Transfer, Delta Sampling, Image Synthesis<br><br>Summary:  
1. This paper addresses the challenge of adapting parameter-efficient components (like LoRA, LyCORIS, ControlNet) to upgraded diffusion models, especially when the base models differ significantly in architecture or parameters, such as between Stable Diffusion (SD) versions 1.x and 2.x.  
2. The authors propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel inference-time method that facilitates knowledge transfer across different base models without needing access to the original training data.  
3. DS works by capturing the "delta," or the difference in model predictions before and after adaptation of a source base model, and then using this delta to guide the denoising steps during inference with a new base model.  
4. This approach allows the reuse of adaptation components like fine-tuned checkpoints and adapters on different underlying diffusion models, overcoming the typical incompatibility caused by architectural changes.  
5. Experimental results across multiple Stable Diffusion versions show that DS consistently improves the generation of the intended visual effects (including style, semantics, and structure) under various sampling techniques, making DS an effective, plug-and-play tool for cross-version knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.  
6. The authors provide code to implement Delta Sampling, encouraging further adoption within the open-source community. <div>
arXiv:2512.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD) drive a vibrant open-source ecosystem including fully fine-tuned checkpoints and parameter-efficient adapters such as LoRA, LyCORIS, and ControlNet. However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis. Code:~ https://github.com/Zhidong-Gao/DeltaSampling

<div> Tokens dynamics, pre-trained Transformers, positional encoding, convergence behavior, Transformer refinement  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper studies the dynamical behavior of tokens within pre-trained Transformer models by analyzing the continuous-time limit of these models as dynamical systems. It characterizes how tokens move relative to each other over time and identifies the asymptotic outcomes, such as tokens converging to zero or diverging to infinity, based on model parameters. The authors provide a set of sufficient conditions for these behaviors that are more general and applicable to practical, real-world Transformer models compared to previous work. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of different positional encoding schemes—specifically absolute positional encoding and rotary positional encoding—on these dynamical regimes and finds that convergence scenarios negatively impact model performance. Motivated by these insights, the authors propose straightforward architectural refinements to Transformers that help mitigate the undesirable convergence behavior in models employing either absolute or rotary positional encoding. The results collectively provide both theoretical insights and practical design principles aimed at improving the stability and performance of Transformer models by controlling token dynamics. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of tokens in pre-trained Transformer models and explores their application to improving Transformers. To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.

<div> Electric Buses, Renewable Energy, Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning, Charging Scheduling, Constrained Markov Decision Process  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing Electric Bus (EB) charging schedules integrated with photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy sources to minimize operational costs while ensuring battery safety. The authors recognize real-world uncertainties such as variable PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, fluctuating travel times, and limited charging infrastructure. To tackle these challenges, they model the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options that allow temporally abstract decision-making. They propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework, introducing the Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian) algorithm. This method integrates Lagrangian relaxation within a Double Actor-Critic framework to handle constraints effectively. At the high level, a centralized PPO-Lagrangian learns safe charger allocation policies, while at the low level, MAPPO-Lagrangian handles decentralized decisions for charging power using Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE). Extensive experiments leveraging real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses existing baselines in minimizing costs and maintaining safety compliance. Additionally, the method achieves fast convergence, proving it effective and practical for real-world EB charging scheduling under uncertain operational conditions. <div>

Abstract: The integration of Electric Buses (EBs) with renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) panels is a promising approach to promote sustainable and low-carbon public transportation. However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework. At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in both cost minimization and safety compliance, while maintaining fast convergence speed.

<div> Keywords: Heterogeneous Treatment Effect, Conditional Average Treatment Effect, Snapchat, experimental data, ad influenceability  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper presents a large-scale industrial framework for estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) using experimental data from hundreds of millions of Snapchat users.  
2. The framework leverages data across many experiments to uncover latent user characteristics that were previously unmeasurable, enabling a more nuanced understanding of treatment effects beyond the one-size-fits-all assumption.  
3. Key components of the framework include careful experiment selection, a well-designed base learner, and an incremental training method that allows for stable and scalable treatment effect estimation.  
4. Two primary applications highlighted are measuring user influenceability to ads and sensitivity to ads, which help in understanding how different users respond differently to advertising interventions.  
5. An online A/B test using influenceability scores for targeting demonstrated substantial business improvements, with gains over six times larger than the typical significance threshold, proving the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world advertising contexts. <div>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) models relax the assumption that treatment effects are the same for every user. We present a large scale industrial framework for estimating HTE using experimental data from hundreds of millions of Snapchat users. By combining results across many experiments, the framework uncovers latent user characteristics that were previously unmeasurable and produces stable treatment effect estimates at scale.
  We describe the core components that enabled this system, including experiment selection, base learner design, and incremental training. We also highlight two applications: user influenceability to ads and user sensitivity to ads. An online A/B test using influenceability scores for targeting showed an improvement on key business metrics that is more than six times larger than what is typically considered significant.

<div> Low-rank decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition, Large Language Models, model compression, gradient descent<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge of compressing Large Language Models (LLMs), which are computationally intensive, by focusing on low-rank decomposition techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The authors identify practical difficulties in this approach, including the selection of appropriate ranks for each layer and eliminating parameter redundancy. To overcome these challenges, they propose two physics-inspired improvements to SVD for LLM compression. First, they introduce FermiGrad, a novel gradient-descent algorithm that optimizes layer-wise ranks globally by converting the typically discrete singular-value truncation process into a continuous optimization problem using the Fermi function. Second, they present PivGa, a lossless compression technique that leverages the intrinsic gauge freedom in the parametrization of low-rank factors, thereby reducing redundancy without any loss of information. Together, these methods enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of compressing LLMs, potentially reducing resource demands while preserving model performance. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are very demanding in terms of their computational resources. Low-rank decompositions of LLM weights, e.g. via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is a promising approach for LLM compression, but presents several practical hurdles, e.g. selecting appropriate layer-wise ranks and getting rid of its parameter redundancy. In this work, we present two physics-inspired improvements to SVD LLM compression: (1) \textbf{FermiGrad}, a gradient-descent algorithm that determines globally optimal layer-wise ranks by relaxing the discrete singular-value truncation into a continuous optimization using the Fermi function; (2) \textbf{PivGa}, an additional \textit{lossless} compression of the low-rank factors that exploits the intrinsic gauge freedom in their parametrization.

<div> Keywords: Generative AI agents, Thompson Sampling, contextual bandits, life sciences, user feedback<br><br>Summary:  
The article addresses a key challenge faced by generative AI agents in life sciences: selecting the best approach to handle a diverse range of queries, from simple factual questions to complex mechanistic reasoning. Traditional methods rely on fixed rules or expensive labeled training data, which lack adaptability to evolving conditions or user needs. To overcome this, the authors introduce a novel framework that integrates AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits, enabling AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies purely from user feedback. Their system optimizes three main dimensions: the choice of generation strategy (direct versus chain-of-thought), selection of tools (such as literature search or drug databases), and domain routing among specialized fields like pharmacology, molecular biology, and clinical expertise. Empirical evaluation on real life science queries demonstrated an improvement in user satisfaction by 15-30% compared to random baseline systems. The learning effect became evident after about 20-30 queries, highlighting the system’s adaptability. Notably, this approach requires no ground truth labels, continuously adapts to user preferences, and effectively balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off essential for agentic AI systems operating in complex and dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: Generative AI agents in life sciences face a critical challenge: determining the optimal approach for diverse queries ranging from simple factoid questions to complex mechanistic reasoning. Traditional methods rely on fixed rules or expensive labeled training data, neither of which adapts to changing conditions or user preferences. We present a novel framework that combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to enable AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies from user feedback alone. Our system optimizes three key dimensions: generation strategy selection (direct vs. chain-of-thought), tool selection (literature search, drug databases, etc.), and domain routing (pharmacology, molecular biology, clinical specialists). Through empirical evaluation on life science queries, we demonstrate 15-30\% improvement in user satisfaction compared to random baselines, with clear learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries. Our approach requires no ground truth labels, adapts continuously to user preferences, and provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in agentic AI systems.

<div> Keywords: energy consumption, pretopology, hierarchical classification, time series clustering, automated recommendations<br><br>Summary: This article addresses the challenge of modeling and classifying energy consumption profiles across a large distributed territory to optimize building energy management. It highlights the impracticality of conducting detailed audits on thousands of buildings due to significant resource demands, proposing an automated approach instead. The authors utilize pretopology to model the consumption profiles of sites and develop a multi-criterion hierarchical classification algorithm that leverages properties of pretopological spaces. This algorithm has been implemented in a Python library for practical use. To validate the method, three datasets are employed: a set of generated points of varying sizes in two-dimensional space, a generated set of time series, and a real dataset comprising 400 consumption time series from a French energy company. The algorithm successfully identifies clusters in the point dataset by considering both spatial position and size parameters. Applied to the generated time series, it achieves perfect clustering (an Adjusted Rand Index of 1) based on Pearson's correlation. These results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in classifying and modeling energy consumption profiles, paving the way for scalable, data-driven recommendations to optimize energy use in buildings. <div>

Abstract: This article attempts answering the following problematic: How to model and classify energy consumption profiles over a large distributed territory to optimize the management of buildings' consumption?
  Doing case-by-case in depth auditing of thousands of buildings would require a massive amount of time and money as well as a significant number of qualified people. Thus, an automated method must be developed to establish a relevant and effective recommendations system.
  To answer this problematic, pretopology is used to model the sites' consumption profiles and a multi-criterion hierarchical classification algorithm, using the properties of pretopological space, has been developed in a Python library.
  To evaluate the results, three data sets are used: A generated set of dots of various sizes in a 2D space, a generated set of time series and a set of consumption time series of 400 real consumption sites from a French Energy company.
  On the point data set, the algorithm is able to identify the clusters of points using their position in space and their size as parameter. On the generated time series, the algorithm is able to identify the time series clusters using Pearson's correlation with an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 1.

Abstract: The advent of the big data paradigm has transformed how industries manage and analyze information, ushering in an era of unprecedented data volume, velocity, and variety. Within this landscape, mixed-data clustering has become a critical challenge, requiring innovative methods that can effectively exploit heterogeneous data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Traditional clustering techniques, typically designed for homogeneous datasets, often struggle to capture the additional complexity introduced by mixed data, underscoring the need for approaches specifically tailored to this setting. Hierarchical and explainable algorithms are particularly valuable in this context, as they provide structured, interpretable clustering results that support informed decision-making. This paper introduces a clustering method grounded in pretopological spaces. In addition, benchmarking against classical numerical clustering algorithms and existing pretopological approaches yields insights into the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method within the big data paradigm.

<div> Keywords: pretopology, mixed data clustering, Disjunctive Normal Form, hierarchical clusters, explainability  
  
<br><br>Summary:  
This article introduces a novel clustering algorithm based on pretopology specifically designed to handle mixed data types without relying on dimensionality reduction techniques. The method utilizes Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) to define customizable logical rules, enabling users to create hierarchical clusters tailored to the specific needs of heterogeneous datasets. Adjustable hyperparameters provide flexibility in cluster construction, allowing for more precise and interpretable grouping. The approach constructs clusters directly from raw data, preserving the integrity and original structure of the datasets. By applying hierarchical dendrogram analysis alongside comparative clustering metrics, the algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods. Empirical results confirm the robustness of the method in generating meaningful and explainable clusters, highlighting its potential to address challenges related to cluster interpretability in mixed data scenarios. The key innovation of this work lies in bypassing dimensionality reduction and instead using logical rule-based criteria to enhance both cluster formation accuracy and transparency. Overall, this research contributes a significant advancement to clustering methodologies for mixed data by improving both performance and explainability while maintaining the fidelity of the original data. <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in relational learning tasks, including node classification and link prediction. However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy. The datasets and source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/mtavassoli/GNN-FC.

<div> Tilted risk, Flow Matching, entropic objective, neural velocity field, risk-sensitive loss  

<br><br>Summary:  
This work investigates the application of tilted (entropic) risk—a log-exponential transform of a base loss—to Flow Matching (FM), a technique that learns a velocity field mapping samples from a source distribution to data via ODE integration. Traditional rectified FM uses a mean squared error loss to train on linearly interpolated sample pairs, which results in predicting only the conditional mean of velocity fields at each space-time point. This approach neglects higher-order conditional information such as variance, skewness, and multi-modality, which are critical for capturing the data manifold's geometric nuances and minority branches. The authors propose applying the risk-sensitive tilted loss to the FM setting, deriving a conditional entropic FM objective that naturally upper bounds the original loss at every space-time location. They further perform a first-order gradient expansion revealing two key corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual and an asymmetric skew tail term that favors rare or minority branches. Experiments on synthetic ambiguous and heavy-tailed data demonstrate that this tilted loss improves statistical performance and more accurately recovers geometric structures compared to standard FM. This approach thus enhances FM’s ability to capture complex conditional distributions and refine learned velocity fields in flow-based generative modeling. <div>
arXiv:2512.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilted (entropic) risk, obtained by applying a log-exponential transform to a base loss, is a well established tool in statistics and machine learning for emphasizing rare or high loss events while retaining a tractable optimization problem. In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.

arXiv:2512.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly stimulated research interest in developing multi-modal LLM (MLLM)-based visual anomaly detection (VAD) algorithms that can be deployed in complex environments. The challenge is that in these complex environments, the anomalies are sometimes highly contextual and also ambiguous, and thereby, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial capacity for an MLLM-based VAD system to succeed. In this paper, we introduce our UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework called ALARM. ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques like reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust and accurate performance and is designed based on a rigorous probabilistic inference pipeline and computational process. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using the real-world smart-home benchmark data and wound image classification data, which shows ALARM's superior performance and its generic applicability across different domains for reliable decision-making.

<div> Keywords: bootstrap particle filters, state estimation, diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration, Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance, hazardous-gas localization<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper addresses critical challenges in early-stage state estimation within emergency response scenarios, where errors can lead to catastrophic outcomes such as delays and resource misallocation.  
2. A key issue identified is Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), observed in bootstrap particle filters under the stationary bootstrap baseline, where parts of the state space excluded by the initial prior remain forever unvisited, even if new contradictory evidence emerges.  
3. Existing classical perturbation methods that can break this lock-in are inefficient as they operate continuously and indiscriminately.  
4. To resolve this, the authors propose a novel diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables dynamic, real-time correction of early estimation errors by expanding the posterior support through entropy-regularized sampling combined with covariance-scaled diffusion.  
5. Their approach incorporates a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance step to ensure adaptivity and statistical soundness.  
6. Empirical validation on complex hazardous-gas localization tasks demonstrates that their method matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are accurate, while significantly outperforming classical sequential Monte Carlo perturbations and RL-based methods when priors are misaligned.  
7. Theoretical guarantees are provided to confirm that the proposed Diffusion-Driven Exploration Particle Filter (DEPF) effectively resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor. <div>
arXiv:2512.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.

<div> Keywords: large language models, hallucination detection, semantic entropy, perplexity decomposition, evidence utilization  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. This paper addresses hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), defined as fluent but unsupported answers, which constrain safe use in critical areas.  
2. The authors introduce ECLIPSE, a framework that models hallucination as a mismatch between a model’s semantic entropy and the capacity of accessible evidence supporting its output.  
3. ECLIPSE uniquely combines entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that assesses how well a model leverages retrieved evidence during response generation.  
4. They prove that the entropy-capacity objective formulated by ECLIPSE is strictly convex under mild conditions, guaranteeing a unique stable optimum for detecting hallucination.  
5. Evaluation on a carefully controlled financial question-answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (200 balanced samples including synthetic hallucinations) shows ECLIPSE achieving strong performance (ROC AUC 0.89, average precision 0.90), significantly outperforming an entropy-only baseline with AUC 0.50.  
6. An ablation study using Claude-3-Haiku, lacking token-level log probabilities, saw performance drop to an AUC of 0.59 and a 95% decrease in coefficient magnitudes, confirming ECLIPSE’s dependence on calibrated token-level uncertainties.  
7. The perplexity decomposition features carry the largest learned coefficients, indicating that how the model uses evidence is critical for detecting hallucinations.  
8. The work is positioned as a mechanism study under controlled settings, with wider validation on diverse domains and real-world hallucinations left for future investigation. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.

<div> Agentic AI, verifiers, sequential hypothesis testing, e-processes, false alarm control<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Agentic AI systems perform sequences of actions in response to user prompts, such as reasoning steps or tool calls, whose success needs to be evaluated reliably.<br>2. Existing verifiers like large language model (LLM) judges and process-reward models provide heuristic scores to assess trajectory quality but lack guarantees for correctness in predicting successful outcomes.<br>3. The paper introduces e-valuator, a novel method that transforms any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control over false alarm rates.<br>4.

Empirical results across six datasets and three agent types show that e-valuator outperforms alternative methods in statistical power and false alarm rate control, and it also facilitates early termination of problematic trajectories to save computation resources.<br>6. As a lightweight, model-agnostic framework, e-valuator offers statistically guaranteed decision-making that can improve the reliability and efficiency of deploying agentic AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2512.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems execute a sequence of actions, such as reasoning steps or tool calls, in response to a user prompt. To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.

<div> Keywords: Shapley values, Explainable AI, nonlinear transformation, sparsity, isotonic regression<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses two key challenges in using Shapley values for feature attribution in Explainable AI: the common assumption of additive payoff functions which often fails in real-world scenarios, and the difficulty of achieving sparse, consistent explanations in high-dimensional settings. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a novel framework that simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity without requiring explicit functional forms, while enforcing an L0 sparsity constraint on Shapley values to improve computational efficiency. The optimization algorithm utilizes Pool-Adjacent-Violators for isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for feature selection, providing ease of implementation and guaranteed global convergence. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that SISR can accurately recover the true transformation under various conditions and effectively identify relevant features even in noisy environments. The work highlights that irrelevant features and feature dependencies can cause nonlinearity in the true payoff function, which standard Shapley methods fail to capture. Empirical evaluations on regression, logistic regression, and tree-based models show that SISR produces stable, consistent attributions, correctly filters out irrelevant features, and avoids the rank and sign distortions seen in conventional Shapley attributions. Overall, SISR advances nonlinear explainability by integrating nonlinear transformation learning with sparsity pursuit in a principled attribution framework. <div>
arXiv:2512.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley values, a gold standard for feature attribution in Explainable AI, face two primary challenges. First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.

<div> Keywords: structural health monitoring, Bayesian neural network, uncertainty quantification, principal component analysis, carbon fiber reinforced polymer<br><br>Summary:  
This article presents an integrated framework for structural health monitoring (SHM) that combines principal component analysis (PCA), Bayesian neural networks (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference to achieve reliable real-time analysis of sensor data. The framework maps sparse strain gauge measurements onto the leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions, enabling spatially resolved quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The method was experimentally validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with different crack lengths. The results showed accurate strain field reconstructions with R squared values above 0.9, demonstrating the framework's robustness even in the presence of noise and crack-induced strain singularities. The BNN provides explicit uncertainty representations that help distinguish between data-inherent noise and model-related limitations at a local scale. This capability allows for more trustworthy decision-making in SHM by highlighting regions of low confidence and their underlying causes. Overall, the proposed approach advances SHM toward the realization of trustworthy digital twins and risk-aware structural diagnostics, promising improved monitoring and maintenance of high-value assets with quantified confidence levels in predictions. <div>

Abstract: Reliable real-time analysis of sensor data is essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) of high-value assets, yet a major challenge is to obtain spatially resolved full-field aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for trustworthy decision-making. We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) unify visual understanding and image generation within a single autoregressive framework. However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for determining the structures of small molecules and is especially critical in the discovery of novel natural products and clinical therapeutics. Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

Abstract: Wastewater-based genomic surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for population-level viral monitoring, offering comprehensive insights into circulating viral variants across entire communities. However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.

<div> Keywords: interleaved reasoning, Plantain, incremental grounding, pass@1 improvement, reduced latency  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. Traditional reasoning models operate by first fully thinking through a problem before generating any visible response, which can waste user time if the model’s reasoning is based on a false premise.  
2. Unlike these models, human communication involves lightweight, incremental grounding acts that confirm mutual understanding and allow early corrections, improving conversation flow.  
3. Inspired by this, the authors propose interleaved reasoning (IR), which alternates between thinking steps and surfacing intermediate outputs, giving users earlier insights into the model’s reasoning progress.  
4. IR aims to reduce perceived latency—how long a user waits for an initial response—without lowering the quality of the final answer.  
5. A specific form of IR called Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving) begins by outputting a step-by-step plan as the first intermediate response, enabling user intervention and feedback during the reasoning process.  
6. Experiments show that Plantain achieves about a 6% improvement in pass@1 accuracy over challenging math and coding benchmarks compared to traditional think-then-answer models.  
7. Additionally, Plantain reduces the time-to-first-response by over 60%, significantly enhancing responsiveness while maintaining or improving output quality. <div>
arXiv:2512.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models often spend a significant amount of time thinking before they generate a visible response. In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard "think-then-answer" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines.

<div> Policy-gradient, memory, POMDP, infinite-horizon, robot navigation<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper focuses on improving policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning in partially observable environments, especially when memory in the policy is necessary. The authors develop several novel algorithms designed to learn policies with memory within an infinite-horizon framework, addressing both scenarios where the environment model is known and where learning must be done through simulation. These advancements aim to overcome the limitations of traditional policy-gradient approaches that perform well for memoryless policies but struggle when memory is required. The study includes comprehensive comparisons across challenging large-scale Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), such as noisy robot navigation tasks and multi-agent settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, showing improved learning performance and policy quality in environments requiring internal memory to manage partial observability. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the applicability of policy-gradient methods to complex domains where agents benefit from maintaining memory to make better decisions over an infinite time horizon. <div>

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods have received increased attention recently as a mechanism for learning to act in partially observable environments. They have shown promise for problems admitting memoryless policies but have been less successful when memory is required. In this paper we develop several improved algorithms for learning policies with memory in an infinite-horizon setting -- directly when a known model of the environment is available, and via simulation otherwise. We compare these algorithms on some large POMDPs, including noisy robot navigation and multi-agent problems.

<div> Network routing, policy-gradient, reinforcement learning, multi-agent cooperation, reward shaping<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses network routing as a distributed decision problem evaluated by numerical performance measures like average packet travel time. The authors apply OLPOMDP, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, to simulated network routing scenarios across various network models. Multiple distributed agents, representing routers, learned to cooperate effectively without explicit communication channels. Notably, the system avoided selfish routing behaviors which, although beneficial on an individual level, were detrimental to overall network performance. An important contribution is the introduction of reward shaping, where the reward signal is modified to penalize sub-optimal routing behaviors explicitly. This modification significantly improved the convergence speed of the learning algorithm. The results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can successfully foster cooperative network routing strategies in a distributed manner, optimizing collective outcomes through shaped incentives. <div>

Abstract: Network routing is a distributed decision problem which naturally admits numerical performance measures, such as the average time for a packet to travel from source to destination. OLPOMDP, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, was successfully applied to simulated network routing under a number of network models. Multiple distributed agents (routers) learned co-operative behavior without explicit inter-agent communication, and they avoided behavior which was individually desirable, but detrimental to the group's overall performance. Furthermore, shaping the reward signal by explicitly penalizing certain patterns of sub-optimal behavior was found to dramatically improve the convergence rate.

Abstract: Perch 2.0 is a supervised bioacoustics foundation model pretrained on 14,597 species, including birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects, and has state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Given that Perch 2.0 includes almost no marine mammal audio or classes in the training data, we evaluate Perch 2.0 performance on marine mammal and underwater audio tasks through few-shot transfer learning. We perform linear probing with the embeddings generated from this foundation model and compare performance to other pretrained bioacoustics models. In particular, we compare Perch 2.0 with previous multispecies whale, Perch 1.0, SurfPerch, AVES-bio, BirdAVES, and Birdnet V2.3 models, which have open-source tools for transfer-learning and agile modeling. We show that the embeddings from the Perch 2.0 model have consistently high performance for few-shot transfer learning, generally outperforming alternative embedding models on the majority of tasks, and thus is recommended when developing new linear classifiers for marine mammal classification with few labeled examples.

<div> Keywords: Process reward models, self-consistency, meta-critique, reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning<br><br>Summary:  
This paper introduces SPARK, a novel three-stage framework designed to improve reinforcement learning (RL) by generating dense, step-level reward feedback without relying on costly annotations or ground truth references. First, SPARK uses a generator model to create diverse solution candidates and applies a verifier model that evaluates them through two verification methods: parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). Second, the verification results are synthesized into training data to fine-tune generative process reward models (PRMs), which act as reward functions for RL training. Results show that training PRMs on aggregated step-level independent verifications surpasses conventional ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench for detecting errors in mathematical reasoning steps, compared to 66.4 for reference-based and 61.9 for GPT-4o methods. In the final stage, the authors integrate the generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) into RL to solve mathematical reasoning problems, introducing format constraints to mitigate reward hacking. Using the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, they attain 47.4% accuracy averaged over six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR methods (43.9%). This approach enables effective reference-free RL training, extending applications to domains without verifiable answers or accessible ground truth. <div>

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) that provide dense, step-level feedback have shown promise for reinforcement learning, yet their adoption remains limited by the need for expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references. We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking. Using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we achieve 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). Our work enables reference-free RL training that exceeds ground-truth methods, opening new possibilities for domains lacking verifiable answers or accessible ground truth.

<div> Keywords: vision language models, factual recall, entity representations, mechanistic analysis, multimodal alignment<br><br>Summary: Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual input representations from a vision encoder with textual embeddings of pretrained large language models (LLMs). This study reveals that many VLMs suffer from degraded factual recall compared to their standalone LLM backbones, raising concerns about the effectiveness of multimodal fine-tuning for extending LLM knowledge to visual inputs. The authors conceptualize factual recall in VLMs as a two-hop problem: first, forming accurate entity representations from visual data, and second, using those representations to retrieve associated factual knowledge. By benchmarking 14 VLMs of different architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), parameter sizes (7B–124B), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their LLM backbones, they find that 11 out of 14 models display factual recall degradation. An in-depth mechanistic analysis focusing on five selected models (three high-performing and two low-performing in recall) demonstrates that poor-performing VLMs resolve entity representations late in the computation, hindering the reuse of existing factual recall circuits in LLMs. In contrast, better-performing VLMs resolve entities early, enabling effective use of pretrained factual knowledge. Finally, the authors propose two interventions to recover or enhance performance: patching entity representations from LLM backbones into VLMs and employing chain-of-thought prompting. Overall, the work highlights that timely early entity resolution is critical and demonstrates how mechanistic interpretability can elucidate and address multimodal alignment failures. <div>

Abstract: Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual representations from a vision encoder with the textual representations of a pretrained large language model (LLM). However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment.

<div> Keywords: aerodynamic surrogates, blended wing body, CFD dataset, inverse design, diffusion model<br><br>Summary:  
The paper introduces BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset specifically designed for blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, addressing the lack of extensive field-resolved datasets for machine learning in aerodynamics. It contains over 12,000 unique geometry cases with steady RANS CFD simulations carried out under a single flight condition, providing 12,490 aerodynamic results. Each case includes integrated force/moment coefficients (CL, CD, CM) and dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients (Cp, Cfx, Cfy, Cfz), facilitating pointwise aerodynamic analysis. The authors establish a standardized benchmark for forward surrogate modeling and evaluate six different model architectures: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), FiLMNet, and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). For inverse design, they formulate a task to achieve a target lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions using a conditional diffusion model. Performance of this approach is benchmarked against gradient-based optimization and a hybrid method combining diffusion sampling and further optimization. BlendedNet++ offers a unified forward and inverse modeling protocol with multi-model baselines, promoting fair, reproducible comparisons across various architectures and optimization strategies. The dataset and associated resources will be publicly released upon acceptance to support further research in aerodynamic field prediction and aircraft design optimization. <div>

Abstract: Despite progress in machine learning-based aerodynamic surrogates, the scarcity of large, field-resolved datasets limits progress on accurate pointwise prediction and reproducible inverse design for aircraft. We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms. We expect BlendedNet++ to catalyze reproducible research in field-level aerodynamics and inverse design; resources (dataset, splits, baselines, and scripts) will be released upon acceptance.

To overcome this, the authors propose a multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) approach that allows devices with varying data sampling frequencies to collaboratively learn a joint machine learning model without sharing raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Multi-frequency FL supports the integration of heterogeneous devices that operate at different sampling rates, improving the flexibility and applicability of HAR systems. The research demonstrates improved performance on two benchmark datasets when compared to frequency-specific models, showing the efficacy of the multi-frequency FL strategy. This method not only advances privacy-aware HAR but also expands its reach to head-worn devices. Additionally, the authors provide a publicly available implementation of their proposed network to encourage further research and development in this domain. Overall, this work presents promising directions for privacy-preserving, multi-device, multi-frequency HAR utilizing Federated Learning. <div>

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benefits various application domains, including health and elderly care. Traditional HAR involves constructing pipelines reliant on centralized user data, which can pose privacy concerns as they necessitate the uploading of user data to a centralized server. This work proposes multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) to enable: (1) privacy-aware ML; (2) joint ML model learning across devices with varying sampling frequency. We focus on head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds and smart glasses), a relatively unexplored domain compared to traditional smartwatch- or smartphone-based HAR. Results have shown improvements on two datasets against frequency-specific approaches, indicating a promising future in the multi-frequency FL-HAR task. The proposed network's implementation is publicly available for further research and development.

<div> Keywords: Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Adaptive Spectral Layer, Fourier Features, Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation, Nonlinear Dynamical Systems<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a popular mesh-free method for solving partial differential equations but face challenges with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear problems due to spectral bias limiting high-frequency representation.<br>2. The paper introduces the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), which incorporates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features at the input stage, allowing dynamic tuning of the network’s spectral basis during training.<br>3. ASPEN is applied to the challenging Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (CGLE), a benchmark for nonlinear and stiff spatio-temporal dynamics, where standard PINNs fail by producing non-physical oscillations.<br>4. Results show ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with high accuracy, achieving a low median physics residual (5.10 x 10^-3) and producing solutions visually indistinguishable from high-resolution ground truth.<br>5. ASPEN's solutions are physically consistent, capturing critical emergent properties such as rapid free energy relaxation and long-term domain wall front stability, demonstrating robustness in complex dynamical system modeling where standard PINNs fail. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.

<div> Keywords: regime transitions, uncertainty quantification, Deep Switching State Space Models, Adaptive Conformal Inference, nonstationarity  

<br><br>Summary:  
This article addresses the challenge of uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting under regime transitions, which typically violate stationarity assumptions. The authors propose a methodology that combines Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and its aggregated variant (AgACI) to provide distribution-free uncertainty estimates. They introduce a unified conformal wrapper that integrates with strong sequence forecasting baselines such as S4, MC-Dropout GRU, sparse Gaussian processes, and change-point local models. This wrapper enables the generation of online predictive confidence bands that offer finite-sample marginal guarantees even in the presence of nonstationarity and model misspecification. The approach is comprehensively tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that the conformalized forecasters maintain near-nominal coverage probabilities, indicating reliable uncertainty quantification, while maintaining competitive point prediction accuracy. Additionally, the method generally produces more efficient predictive bands, meaning tighter and more informative uncertainty intervals. Overall, the work contributes a robust framework for uncertainty-aware forecasting in complex, regime-switching environments prevalent in many real-world time series applications. <div>

Abstract: Regime transitions routinely break stationarity in time series, making calibrated uncertainty as important as point accuracy. We study distribution-free uncertainty for regime-switching forecasting by coupling Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and its aggregated variant (AgACI). We also introduce a unified conformal wrapper that sits atop strong sequence baselines including S4, MC-Dropout GRU, sparse Gaussian processes, and a change-point local model to produce online predictive bands with finite-sample marginal guarantees under nonstationarity and model misspecification. Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.

<div> reservoir inflow prediction, domain generalization, domain shift, spatial metadata, adversarial learning  

<br><br>Summary:  
Deep learning models for reservoir inflow prediction often experience performance drops when applied to new reservoirs due to domain shifts caused by differing data distributions. Traditional domain generalization (DG) approaches attempt to find domain-invariant representations to address this but face limitations in hydrological systems where each reservoir has distinct inflow dynamics and spatial metadata influences patterns indirectly. To tackle these challenges, the paper introduces HydroDCM, a novel scalable DG framework designed for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. HydroDCM leverages spatial metadata to generate pseudo-domain labels, which then guide adversarial learning aimed at extracting invariant temporal features relevant across domains. Additionally, the framework includes lightweight conditioning layers during inference that adapt these learned features based on the target reservoir's metadata, allowing a balance between DG invariance and location-specific adjustment. Experimental validation on 30 real reservoirs from the Upper Colorado River Basin shows HydroDCM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art DG methods under scenarios involving many domains. Besides improved accuracy, the approach remains computationally efficient, making it a practical solution for real-world hydrological forecasting applications involving diverse reservoir systems. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in reservoir inflow prediction, yet their performance often deteriorates when applied to different reservoirs due to distributional differences, referred to as the domain shift problem. Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation. Experiment results on 30 real-world reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art DG baselines under many-domain conditions and remains computationally efficient.

<div> Keywords: Tabular Foundation Models, synthetic datasets, adversarial training, optimality gap, TabPFN V2<br><br>Summary: The paper presents advancements in tabular foundation models (TFMs), emphasizing their growing ability to outperform traditional machine learning techniques for structured data. A significant insight is that TFMs can be pretrained exclusively on synthetic data, which allows for the deliberate design of data generators to instill desirable model characteristics. Unlike previous approaches that focused on improving generator priors, this work introduces a parameterized generator distribution to adopt an adversarial robustness perspective. Specifically, the generator is adapted during training to highlight datasets that are most challenging for the model. The authors formalize this concept through an optimality gap metric, which measures the difference between the TFM’s performance and the best achievable outcomes estimated by strong baseline models such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building upon this framework, they develop Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training strategy. When applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM yields up to a 6% improvement in mean normalized AUC compared to the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, with fewer than 100,000 additional synthetic datasets needed. These findings suggest a new promising direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs solely using synthetic data. <div>

Abstract: The development of tabular foundation models (TFMs) has accelerated in recent years, showing strong potential to outperform traditional ML methods for structured data. A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.

<div> coarse resolution, bias correction, operator learning, Earth-system model, U-Net<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This article addresses the challenges of coarse resolution, imperfect parameterizations, and uncertain initial states that limit the accuracy of Earth-system model (ESM) predictions. Traditional bias correction methods improve constrained simulations but are less effective when models run freely. To overcome this, the authors introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies, applying these corrections online during model integration. They design two operator architectures, the Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M&M), which incorporate diverse upsampling techniques and varying receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features while adhering to Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Training on two years of E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis enables these operators to generalize well across vertical height levels and seasonal variations. Offline tests show that both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines, suggesting that the functional diversity of the networks, rather than parameter count, is key to performance. In online hybrid E3SM experiments, the M&M architecture achieves the most consistent bias reductions across several variables and vertical layers. Importantly, the ML-augmented model configurations maintain long-term stability and computational feasibility in multi-year runs, paving the way for scalable hybrid Earth-system modeling that emphasizes stability, portability, and cadence-limited updates. <div>

Abstract: Coarse resolution, imperfect parameterizations, and uncertain initial states and forcings limit Earth-system model (ESM) predictions. Traditional bias correction via data assimilation improves constrained simulations but offers limited benefit once models run freely. We introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies and applies them online during integration. Building on a U-Net backbone, we develop two operator architectures Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M\&amp;M) that combine diverse upsampling and receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Trained on two years E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis, the operators generalize across height levels and seasons. Both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines in offline tests, indicating that functional richness rather than parameter count drives performance. In online hybrid E3SM runs, M\&amp;M delivers the most consistent bias reductions across variables and vertical levels. The ML-augmented configurations remain stable and computationally feasible in multi-year simulations, providing a practical pathway for scalable hybrid modeling. Our framework emphasizes long-term stability, portability, and cadence-limited updates, demonstrating the utility of expressive ML operators for learning structured, cross-scale relationships and retrofitting legacy ESMs.

<div> Memory, KV cache, retention gate, token eviction, LLM interpretability<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper addresses the memory and computational bottlenecks in long-horizon large language model (LLM) inference caused by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and growing key-value (KV) caches.  
2. It introduces TRIM-KV, a novel method that assigns each token an intrinsic importance score at creation through a lightweight retention gate, which predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, specific to layer and attention head.  
3. Tokens with low retention scores are evicted when memory capacity is exceeded, ensuring the KV cache prioritizes the most critical tokens while maintaining efficiency.  
4. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently by distilling knowledge from a frozen LLM and incorporating a capacity loss, requiring only fine-tuning of the retention gates and adding minimal inference overhead.  
5. Experimental results across diverse tasks—mathematical reasoning, procedural generation, conversational long-memory, and long-context understanding—show TRIM-KV consistently outperforms existing eviction and retrieval baselines, especially in memory-constrained settings, sometimes even surpassing full-cache models by reducing noise from uninformative tokens.  
6. Qualitative analysis reveals that retention scores align well with human intuition and naturally recover known heuristics like sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit programming.  
7. Beyond efficiency gains, the learned retention scores offer interpretability into layer- and head-specific functions, pointing toward new directions in understanding LLM behavior. <div>
arXiv:2512.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is plagued by two key challenges: high communication overhead and performance collapse on heterogeneous (non-IID) data. Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision.

<div> Keywords: Off-Policy Evaluation, deterministic auctions, bid landscape model, Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring, online advertising  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of applying Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) in the context of online advertising auctions, which are deterministic and winner-takes-all, unlike stochastic policy settings common in recommender systems. Traditional OPE methods fail here due to zero exposure probability for non-winning ads. The authors propose the first principled OPE framework tailored for deterministic auctions by utilizing the bid landscape model to approximate propensity scores. This approximation enables the use of stable estimators such as Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for reliable counterfactual evaluation. Their approach is validated on both the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and through a two-week online A/B test on a large-scale industrial platform. Results demonstrate strong alignment with real online outcomes, achieving 92% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a key metric for deployment decisions as it indicates whether a new model will improve or degrade performance. Overall, this work delivers the first practical, validated, and efficient framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, providing a safer and resource-efficient alternative to costly and risky live online experiments. <div>

Abstract: Online A/B testing, the gold standard for evaluating new advertising policies, consumes substantial engineering resources and risks significant revenue loss from deploying underperforming variations. This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments.

It highlights the limitations of classical aggregation rules which assume Euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, making them inadequate for emerging quantum federated systems. The authors propose A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a novel framework that incorporates dual gains: a geometry gain for regulating geometric blending between models and a QoS gain that reflects client importance based on teleportation fidelity, latency, and device instability. The paper formulates the A2G update rule and provides theoretical convergence guarantees under assumptions of smoothness and bounded variance. Moreover, A2G generalizes existing methods by recovering FedAvg, QoS-aware averaging, and manifold-based aggregation as special cases. Experimental evaluation on a quantum-classical hybrid testbed demonstrates that A2G achieves improved training stability and higher accuracy in the presence of heterogeneous and noisy network conditions, thus validating its effectiveness for federated learning in quantum-enabled environments. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.

<div> Intrusion Detection, Multimodal Data, Diffusion Model, Data Augmentation, Cybersecurity<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses critical challenges faced by modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), specifically dealing with heterogeneous network traffic, evolving cyber threats, and significant imbalances between benign and attack flow data. Existing data augmentation methods using generative models are typically limited to single data modalities and do not effectively capture dependencies across different data domains. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose MAGE-ID, a novel multimodal generative framework based on diffusion processes that integrates tabular flow features with their corresponding transformed images using a shared latent prior. MAGE-ID employs a combined architecture featuring Transformer-based and CNN-based variational encoders alongside an EDM style denoiser to enable coherent and balanced synthesis of multimodal data. Evaluations conducted on popular benchmark datasets CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD reveal that MAGE-ID significantly outperforms existing baselines such as TabSyn and TabDDPM in terms of data fidelity and diversity. Importantly, this improved data generation translates into better downstream intrusion detection performance. The results demonstrate that MAGE-ID is an effective augmentation approach capable of enhancing the robustness and accuracy of IDS by leveraging multimodal data correlations and advanced generative modeling techniques. <div>

Abstract: Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face severe challenges due to heterogeneous network traffic, evolving cyber threats, and pronounced data imbalance between benign and attack flows.

By jointly training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with an EDM style denoiser, MAGE-ID achieves balanced and coherent multimodal synthesis. Evaluations on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection performance over TabSyn and TabDDPM, highlighting the effectiveness of MAGE-ID for multimodal IDS augmentation.

The paper introduces UniQL, a unified framework combining post-training quantization and low-rank compression with configurable on-device pruning to optimize LLM deployment on resource-constrained platforms. UniQL supports various model architectures, including Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models, making it versatile for diverse edge applications. Key innovations include a structured weight-sorting method that accelerates computation by 20 times, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce quantization noise, state-aware weight sorting specifically designed for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel optimized for pruned models. The framework integrates weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization into a single cloud-based pass, while allowing devices to configure pruning rates up to 35% at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate memory footprint reductions between 4x to 5.7x and throughput improvements of 2.7x to 3.4x, all while maintaining accuracy within 5% of original uncompressed models at 15% pruning levels across tested models including Llama3, Qwen2.5, Mamba2, Nemotron-H, and Bamba-v2. The code and pre-quantized models are made publicly available on GitHub for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Deploying large language model (LLM) models on mobile platforms faces significant challenges due to the limited memory and shared computational resources of the device. Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2). The code and quantized models are available at: https://github.com/enyac-group/UniQL.

<div> Keywords: joint sparsity, multiple measurement vectors, implicit regularization, overparameterization, gradient descent<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the problem of recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting, a common challenge in machine learning. Traditional algorithms such as M-OMP and M-FOCUSS require careful tuning of parameters or prior knowledge about signal sparsity and noise variance, which can be impractical. The authors propose a novel tuning-free approach that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) emerging from overparameterization to overcome these limitations. Their method reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors, which effectively separate the shared row support of the signals from the entries corresponding to individual measurement vectors. By applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective defined on these factors, the optimization dynamics inherently encourage the emergence of row-sparsity without explicit regularization. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization behaves like a "momentum-like" process, causing rows corresponding to the true support to grow significantly faster in norm than others, thus guaranteeing convergence towards an ideal row-sparse solution. Experimental results confirm that the proposed framework achieves performance on par with traditional, tuned methods but without the need for any prior parameter knowledge or tuning, offering a practical and theoretically grounded alternative for MMV sparse recovery tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods like multiple measurement vectors orthogonal matching pursuit (M-OMP) and multiple measurement vectors FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (M-FOCUSS) often require careful parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal and/or noise variance. We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a "momentum-like" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to established methods without requiring any prior information or tuning.

<div> Keywords: Graph classification, Hyperdimensional Computing, Vector Symbolic Architectures, Spike Diffusion, Associative Message Passing  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the fundamental task of graph classification, relevant in areas such as molecular property prediction and materials design. It recognizes that while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide strong predictive performance through message passing, their high computational cost limits scalability and deployment on resource-constrained platforms. As an alternative, the work leverages Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also called Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), which is lightweight and brain-inspired but traditionally less accurate than GNNs in graph tasks. The authors propose a novel framework named VS-Graph that bridges the gap between HDC efficiency and GNN expressive power. VS-Graph incorporates a Spike Diffusion mechanism to identify nodes based on graph topology and an Associative Message Passing scheme to aggregate multi-hop neighborhood information entirely within high-dimensional vector spaces. Uniquely, this method does not rely on gradient-based optimization or backpropagation yet achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, surpassing previous HDC baselines by 4-5% on benchmarks like MUTAG and DD. Additionally, VS-Graph matches or exceeds GNN performance on other datasets while speeding up training by up to 450 times. The framework also sustains high accuracy with vector dimensionality compressed down to 128, enabling ultra-efficient operation on edge devices and neuromorphic hardware. <div>

Abstract: Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.

<title>Full-Stack Alignment: Co-Aligning AI and Institutions with Thick Models of Value</title>

<div> Keywords: full-stack alignment, values, normative reasoning, AI systems, collective goods<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This article argues that aligning individual AI systems solely with their operators' intentions is insufficient to ensure beneficial societal outcomes, as organizational goals may conflict with broader social interests. It introduces the concept of full-stack alignment, which calls for the simultaneous alignment of AI systems and the institutions governing them with the values held by people, without prescribing a fixed vision of well-being. The paper critiques current methods of representing values, such as utility functions and preference orderings, highlighting their deficiencies in distinguishing values from transient preferences, enabling normative reasoning, and modeling collective goods. To address these issues, the authors propose "thick models of value," structured frameworks that capture enduring values, acknowledge the social context of individual choices, and facilitate normative reasoning to apply values across diverse situations. They illustrate the utility of thick value models through five key applications: guiding AI value stewardship, creating normatively competent AI agents, designing negotiation systems that yield mutually beneficial outcomes, developing economic mechanisms that preserve meaning, and establishing democratic regulatory institutions. This approach aims to foster AI systems and social structures that better reflect complex human values and promote positive societal impacts. <div>

Abstract: Beneficial societal outcomes cannot be guaranteed by aligning individual AI systems with the intentions of their operators or users. Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.

<div> Keywords: world-modeling, Transformers, Rubik's Cube, state-prediction, reinforcement learning  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper investigates the impact of explicit world-modeling objectives on the internal representations and downstream performance of Transformer models during different phases of training. Using a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube environment, the authors explore two primary questions: how explicit pretraining to model the world influences latent state representations, and how the quality of these learned world models affects performance after reinforcement learning (RL) post-training. They compare standard next-token prediction training with two explicit world-modeling approaches: (i) state-prediction pretraining alone and (ii) a joint objective combining state prediction and next-token prediction. After pretraining, the models undergo Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training method for solving the cube tasks. The study evaluates the learned representations through linear probing and causal intervention techniques to measure decodability and controllability of internal states. Results show that explicit world-modeling improves both the linear decodability and causal steerability of latent state representations. Crucially, higher-quality state representations enable better gains from subsequent GRPO training, particularly on more complex cube states. The findings suggest that enhancing state representation quality through explicit world-modeling can significantly improve post-training effectiveness for sequence-planning problems. <div>

Abstract: In this work we study how explicit world-modeling objectives affect the internal representations and downstream capability of Transformers across different training stages. We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks.

<div> GaussDetect-LiNGAM, bivariate causal discovery, Gaussianity, kernel independence tests, causal inference<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper introduces GaussDetect-LiNGAM, a new method for bivariate causal discovery that removes the need for direct Gaussianity tests by utilizing an equivalence between noise Gaussianity in the forward regression and residual independence in the reverse regression. Operating under standard LiNGAM assumptions—linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity—the authors prove that Gaussian noise in the forward causal model corresponds exactly to independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This key theoretical finding replaces conventional Gaussianity tests, which are often fragile and sensitive to sample size, with more robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental evaluations confirm both the theoretical equivalence and practical advantages of GaussDetect-LiNGAM. The method shows consistent performance across various noise distributions and sample sizes while requiring fewer tests per decision (TPD), enhancing efficiency. Overall, GaussDetect-LiNGAM improves the practicality and reliability of causal inference within the LiNGAM framework, making it more accessible for real-world data analysis by reducing test complexity and increasing robustness against noisy or limited data scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We propose GaussDetect-LiNGAM, a novel approach for bivariate causal discovery that eliminates the need for explicit Gaussianity tests by leveraging a fundamental equivalence between noise Gaussianity and residual independence in the reverse regression. Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD). Our method enhances both the efficiency and practical applicability of causal inference, making LiNGAM more accessible and reliable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Grokking-delayed generalization that emerges well after a model has fit the training data-has been linked to robustness and representation quality. We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting. Our results highlight when a model is trained (pre- vs. post-grokking) as an orthogonal lever to how unlearning is performed, providing a practical recipe to improve existing unlearning methods without altering their algorithms.

<title>Multi-Modal Opinion Integration for Financial Sentiment Analysis using Cross-Modal Attention</title>

Abstract: In recent years, financial sentiment analysis of public opinion has become increasingly important for market forecasting and risk assessment. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent. These results highlight the potential of our framework to support more accurate financial decision-making and risk management.

Abstract: Chronic diseases often progress differently across patients. Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.

Abstract: The global rise in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective screening methods. Current diagnosis requires biochemical assays, which are invasive and costly. Advances in consumer wearables have enabled early explorations of machine learning-based disease detection, but prior studies were limited to controlled settings. We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients. These findings demonstrate that combining engineered features with lightweight architectures can support accurate, rapid, and generalizable detection of type 2 diabetes in real-world wearable settings.

Abstract: Event-based models (EBMs) infer disease progression from cross-sectional data, and standard EBMs assume a single underlying disease per individual. In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and computational implementation is a major bottleneck in Scientific Computing (SciC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.
  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides an attractive solution for large-area tactile sensing due to its minimal wiring and shape flexibility, but its nonlinear inverse problem often leads to severe artifacts and inaccurate contact reconstruction. This work presents PhyDNN, a physics-driven deep reconstruction framework that embeds the EIT forward model directly into the learning objective. By jointly minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps and enforcing consistency with the forward PDE, PhyDNN reduces the black-box nature of deep networks and improves both physical plausibility and generalization. To enable efficient backpropagation, we design a differentiable forward-operator network that accurately approximates the nonlinear EIT response, allowing fast physics-guided training. Extensive simulations and real tactile experiments on a 16-electrode soft sensor show that PhyDNN consistently outperforms NOSER, TV, and standard DNNs in reconstructing contact shape, location, and pressure distribution. PhyDNN yields fewer artifacts, sharper boundaries, and higher metric scores, demonstrating its effectiveness for high-quality tomographic tactile sensing.

Abstract: Compressed sensing enables sparse sampling but relies on generic bases and random measurements, limiting efficiency and reconstruction quality. Optimal sensor placement uses historcal data to design tailored sampling patterns, yet its fixed, linear bases cannot adapt to nonlinear or sample-specific variations. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves reconstruction using deep generative priors but still employs suboptimal random sampling. We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements.

Abstract: Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.

<title>Towards Irreversible Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.

<title>When, How Long and How Much? Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate</title>

Abstract: Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.
  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment provide interpretable geometric frameworks for comparing, transforming, and aggregating heterogeneous datasets -- tasks ubiquitous in data science and machine learning. Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the VesselEdge system, which leverages federated learning and bandwidth-constrained trajectory compression to enhance maritime situational awareness by extending AIS coverage. VesselEdge transforms vessels into mobile sensors, enabling real-time anomaly detection and efficient data transmission over low-bandwidth connections. The system integrates the M3fed model for federated learning and the BWC-DR-A algorithm for trajectory compression, prioritizing anomalous data. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of VesselEdge in improving AIS coverage and situational awareness using historical data.

<title>Observation-driven correction of numerical weather prediction for marine winds</title>

Abstract: Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.

Abstract: Merging neural networks without retraining is central to federated and distributed learning. Common methods such as weight averaging or Fisher merging often lose accuracy and are unstable across seeds. CoGraM (Contextual Granular Merging) is a multi-stage, context-sensitive, loss-based, and iterative optimization method across layers, neurons, and weight levels that aligns decisions with loss differences and thresholds and prevents harmful updates through rollback. CoGraM is an optimization method that addresses the weaknesses of methods such as Fisher and can significantly improve the merged network.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to enhance neural network performance when training data and application data are not very similar, e.g., out of distribution problems, as well as pattern and regime shifts. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Retrain the neural network towards reasonable subsets of the training data set and note down the resulting weight anomalies. 2) Choose reasonable predictors and derive a regression between the predictors and the weight anomalies. 3) Extrapolate the weights, and thereby the neural network, to the application data. We show and discuss this method in three use cases from the climate sciences, which include successful temporal, spatial and cross-domain extrapolations of neural networks.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is essential for demand management and smart grid operations. This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly evaluate temporal encodings, calendar-based features, and hybrid ensemble architectures within a unified short-term energy forecasting framework.

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a powerful method for guiding the behavior of generative models towards desired outcomes such as toxicity mitigation. However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.

Abstract: While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.

Abstract: We propose a novel QTGNN framework for detecting fraudulent transactions in large-scale financial networks. By integrating quantum embedding, variational graph convolutions, and topological data analysis, QTGNN captures complex transaction dynamics and structural anomalies indicative of fraud. The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning. QTGNN offers a theoretically sound, interpretable, and practical solution for financial fraud detection, bridging quantum machine learning, graph theory, and topological analysis.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems face increasing resilience challenges from extreme weather events, but current assessment methods rely on surface-level recovery indicators that miss hidden structural damage. Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and "false recovery," where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining "structural irreversibility detection" and "energy landscape reconstruction" has been developed. Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring. Our framework provides tools for proactive structural risk assessment, enabling infrastructure investments based on true system health rather than misleading surface metrics.

Abstract: Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.

Abstract: Urban analytics increasingly relies on AI-driven trajectory analysis, yet current approaches suffer from methodological fragmentation: trajectory learning captures movement patterns but ignores spatial context, while spatial embedding methods encode street networks but miss temporal dynamics. Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.

Abstract: Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.

Abstract: Smartphones and smartwatches are ever-present in daily life, and provide a rich source of information on their users' behaviour. In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities. Evaluating on a new dataset, NFI\_FARED, which contains digital traces from four different types of iPhones labelled with 19 activities, it was found that our approach could produce useful LR systems to distinguish 167 out of a possible 171 activity pairings. The same approach was extended to analyse likelihoods for multiple activities (or groups of activities) simultaneously and create activity timelines to aid in both the early and latter stages of forensic investigations. The dataset and all code required to replicate the results have also been made public to encourage further research on this topic.

Abstract: Clinical pathways are specialized healthcare plans that model patient treatment procedures. They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications. The results show that our method enables expanding the knowledge base of clinical pathways with sufficient precision, peaking to 95.62% AUC while maintaining an arc-degree simplicity of 67.11%.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram is a useful diagnostic signal that can detect cardiac abnormalities by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart. Due to its rapid, non-invasive, and richly informative characteristics, ECG has many emerging applications. In this paper, we study novel deep learning technologies to effectively manage and analyse ECG data, with the aim of building a diagnostic model, accurately and quickly, that can substantially reduce the burden on medical workers. Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age). Our evaluations on representative ECG datasets validate the superiority of our model against state-of-the-art works in terms of high precision, multi-feature fusion, and lightweights.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Configuration: A Case Study on Optimizing OneMax with the (1+($\lambda$,$\lambda$))-GA</title>

Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) studies the efficient identification of control policies for parameterized optimization algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\lambda$,$\lambda$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.

Abstract: When using an LLM through an API provider, users expect the served model to remain consistent over time, a property crucial for the reliability of downstream applications and the reproducibility of research. Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of depth sensors has substantially lowered the barrier to point-cloud acquisition. This letter proposes a semantic wireless transmission framework for three dimension (3D) point clouds built on Deep Joint Source - Channel Coding (DeepJSCC). Instead of sending raw features, the transmitter predicts combination weights over a receiver-side semantic orthogonal feature pool, enabling compact representations and robust reconstruction. A folding-based decoder deforms a 2D grid into 3D, enforcing manifold continuity while preserving geometric fidelity. Trained with Chamfer Distance (CD) and an orthogonality regularizer, the system is evaluated on ModelNet40 across varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and bandwidths. Results show performance on par with SEmantic Point cloud Transmission (SEPT) at high bandwidth and clear gains in bandwidth-constrained regimes, with consistent improvements in both Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and CD. Ablation experiments confirm the benefits of orthogonalization and the folding prior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.

Abstract: Decision support systems often rely on solving complex optimization problems that may require to estimate uncertain parameters beforehand. Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation. In our results, the method reduces costly inner solver calls, with a solution quality comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing can significantly improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption, yet the energy demands of AI models may offset these gains. This study utilizes in-situ sensing-based prediction of geometric quality in smart machining to compare the energy consumption, accuracy, and speed of common AI models. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) is introduced as an alternative, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional models while drastically reducing energy consumption, 200$\times$ for training and 175 to 1000$\times$ for inference. Furthermore, HDC reduces training times by 200$\times$ and inference times by 300 to 600$\times$, showcasing its potential for energy-efficient smart manufacturing.

<title>Automatic Attack Discovery for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.

Abstract: Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using \v{C}ech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.

Abstract: We introduce Density-Informed VAE (DiVAE), a lightweight, data-driven regularizer that aligns the VAE log-prior probability $\log p_Z(z)$ with a log-density estimated from data. Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration. On MNIST, DiVAE improves alignment of the prior with external estimates of the density, providing better interpretability, and improves OOD detection for learnable priors.

Abstract: In the vision domain, dataset distillation arises as a technique to condense a large dataset into a smaller synthetic one that exhibits a similar result in the training process. While image data presents an extensive literature of distillation methods, text dataset distillation has fewer works in comparison. Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications. In this report, we review past and recent advances in dataset distillation for text, highlighting different distillation strategies, key contributions, and general challenges.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often relies on behavior regularization that enforces policies to remain close to the dataset distribution. However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

Abstract: Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) becomes challenging when probe-vehicle penetration is low and observations are spatially sparse. Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE.

Abstract: Cross-entropy (CE) training loss dominates deep learning practice, yet existing theory often relies on simplifications, either replacing it with squared loss or restricting to convex models, that miss essential behavior. CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values. This technique opens a pathway for analyzing CE training dynamics well beyond our specific setting considered here.

Abstract: Training with differential privacy (DP) provides a guarantee to members in a dataset that they cannot be identified by users of the released model. However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training. This leads to the first known DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility whose DP verification scales better than training cost, significantly reducing verification costs on large datasets.

Abstract: Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.

<title>MarkTune: Improving the Quality-Detectability Trade-off in Open-Weight LLM Watermarking</title>

Abstract: Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models require immense computational resources, motivating research into low-precision training. Quantised training addresses this by representing training components in low-bit integers, but typically relies on discretising real-valued updates. We introduce an alternative approach where the update rule itself is discrete, avoiding the quantisation of continuous updates by design. We establish convergence guarantees for a general class of such discrete schemes, and present a multinomial update rule as a concrete example, supported by empirical evaluation. This perspective opens new avenues for efficient training, particularly for models with inherently discrete structure.

<title>Eval Factsheets: A Structured Framework for Documenting AI Evaluations</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: In todays increasing world, it is very important to have good hailing services like Ola, Uber, and Rapido as it is very essential for our daily transportation. Users often face difficulties in choosing the most appropriate and efficient ride that would lead to both cost-effective and would take us to our destination in less time. This project provides you with the web application that helps you to select the most beneficial ride for you by providing users with the fare comparison between Ola, Uber, Rapido for the destination entered by the user. The backend is use to fetch the data, providing users with the fare comparison for the ride and finally providing with the best option using Python. This research paper also addresses the problem and challenges faced in accessing the data using APIs, Android Studios emulator, Appium and location comparison. Thus, the aim of the project is to provide transparency to the users in ride-hailing services and increase efficiency and provide users with better experience.

<title>Learning Steerable Clarification Policies with Collaborative Self-play</title>

Abstract: To handle underspecified or ambiguous queries, AI assistants need a policy for managing their uncertainty to determine (a) when to guess the user intent and answer directly, (b) when to enumerate and answer multiple possible intents, and (c) when to ask a clarifying question. However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy. Moreover, our procedure also generalizes to numerical cost values that were unobserved at training time.

<title>Advancing Multi-Step Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models through Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.

<title>Exploring Syntropic Frameworks in AI Alignment: A Philosophical Investigation</title>

Abstract: I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.

Abstract: We prove an impossibility result for conditional Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-efficient reasoning in large language models. While recent work has established marginal PAC efficiency guarantees for composite models that switch between expensive expert models and cheaper fast models, we show that conditional (pointwise) guarantees are impossible in the distribution-free setting. Specifically, for non-atomic input spaces, any algorithm achieving conditional PAC efficiency must be trivial in the sense that it defers to the expert model with probability at least $1-\alpha$ for almost every input.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.
  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.
  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.

<title>Calibrating Geophysical Predictions under Constrained Probabilistic Distributions</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown significant promise in studying complex geophysical dynamical systems, including turbulence and climate processes. Such systems often display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, reflected in positive Lyapunov exponents, where even small perturbations in short-term forecasts can lead to large deviations in long-term outcomes. Thus, meaningful inference requires not only accurate short-term predictions, but also consistency with the system's long-term attractor that is captured by the marginal distribution of state variables. Existing approaches attempt to address this challenge by incorporating spatial and temporal dependence, but these strategies become impractical when data are extremely sparse. In this work, we show that prior knowledge of marginal distributions offers valuable complementary information to short-term observations, motivating a distribution-informed learning framework. We introduce a calibration algorithm based on normalization and the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to enhance ML predictions. The method here employs KSD within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to calibrate model outputs, improving their fidelity to known physical distributions. This not only sharpens pointwise predictions but also enforces consistency with non-local statistical structures rooted in physical principles. Through synthetic experiments-spanning offline climatological CO2 fluxes and online quasi-geostrophic flow simulations-we demonstrate the robustness and broad utility of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Frontier AI developers may fail to align or control highly-capable AI agents. In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVCs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in comparison to classical models for machine learning tasks. By evaluating these models on the Iris and MNIST-PCA datasets, we find that quantum models tend to outperform classical approaches as the problem complexity increases. While QSVCs generally provide more consistent results, QNNs exhibit superior performance in higher-complexity tasks due to their increased quantum load. Additionally, we analyze the impact of hyperparameter tuning, showing that feature maps and ansatz configurations significantly influence model accuracy. We also compare the PennyLane and Qiskit frameworks, concluding that Qiskit provides better optimization and efficiency for our implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for complex classification problems and provide insights into model selection and optimization strategies

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare IoT systems promises faster decisions and improved medical support. LLMs are also deployed as multi-agent teams to assist AI doctors by debating, voting, or advising on decisions. However, when multiple assistant agents interact, coordinated adversaries can collude to create false consensus, pushing an AI doctor toward harmful prescriptions. We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems. In contrast, the verifier agent restores 100% accuracy by blocking adversarial consensus. This work provides the first systematic evidence of collusion risk in AI healthcare and demonstrates a practical, lightweight defence that ensures guideline fidelity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked interest in Trustworthy AI and AI Implementation Science, both of which are essential for accelerating clinical adoption. However, strict regulations, gaps between research and clinical settings, and challenges in evaluating AI systems continue to hinder real-world implementation. This study presents an AI implementation case study within Shriners Childrens (SC), a large multisite pediatric system, showcasing the modernization of SCs Research Data Warehouse (RDW) to OMOP CDM v5.4 within a secure Microsoft Fabric environment. We introduce a Python-based data quality assessment tool compatible with SCs infrastructure, extending OHDsi's R/Java-based Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) and integrating Trustworthy AI principles using the METRIC framework. This extension enhances data quality evaluation by addressing informative missingness, redundancy, timeliness, and distributional consistency. We also compare systematic and case-specific AI implementation strategies for Craniofacial Microsomia (CFM) using the FHIR standard. Our contributions include a real-world evaluation of AI implementations, integration of Trustworthy AI principles into data quality assessment, and insights into hybrid implementation strategies that blend systematic infrastructure with use-case-driven approaches to advance AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become indispensable in critical domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and recommendation systems, yet their black-box nature hinders deployment in scenarios requiring transparency and accountability. While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs. The implementation of QGShap is available at https://github.com/smlab-niser/qgshap.

Abstract: This study proposes a new discrete neural operator for surrogate modeling of transient Darcy flow fields in heterogeneous porous media with random parameters. The new method integrates temporal encoding, operator learning and UNet to approximate the mapping between vector spaces of random parameter and spatiotemporal flow fields. The new discrete neural operator can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the SOTA attention-residual-UNet structure. Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set.

Abstract: Modern deep learning faces significant challenges with noisy labels, class ambiguity, as well as the need to robustly reject out-of-distribution or corrupted samples. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a "drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries. Furthermore, our drainage formulation enables applications well beyond classification, with immediate benefits for web-scale, semi-supervised dataset cleaning, and open-set applications.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators can directly emulate time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling the exploration of diverse physical phenomena such as phase transitions, quench dynamics, and non-equilibrium processes. Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.

Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of language models to improve the classification of labor market information by linking job vacancy texts to two major European frameworks: the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). We examine and compare two prominent methodologies from the literature: Sentence Linking and Entity Linking. In support of ongoing research, we release an open-source tool, incorporating these two methodologies, designed to facilitate further work on labor classification and employment discourse. To move beyond surface-level skill extraction, we introduce two annotated datasets specifically aimed at evaluating how occupations and qualifications are represented within job vacancy texts. Additionally, we examine different ways to utilize generative large language models for this task. Our findings contribute to advancing the state of the art in job entity extraction and offer computational infrastructure for examining work, skills, and labor market narratives in a digitally mediated economy.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables non-invasive assessment of prostate microstructure but conventional metrics such as the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in multiparametric MRI lack specificity to underlying histology. Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings highlight the potential of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling to improve non-invasive prostate cancer characterization and reduce unnecessary biopsies.

Abstract: We study estimation and statistical inference for reward models used in aligning large language models (LLMs). A key component of LLM alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where humans compare pairs of model-generated answers and their preferences are used to train a reward model. However, human feedback is inherently heterogeneous, creating significant challenges for reliable reward learning. To address this, we adopt a heterogeneous preference framework that jointly models the latent reward of answers and human rationality. This leads to a challenging biconvex optimization problem, which we solve via an alternating gradient descent algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting estimator, including its convergence and asymptotic distribution. These results enable the construction of confidence intervals for reward estimates. Leveraging these uncertainty quantification results, we conduct valid statistical comparisons between rewards and incorporate uncertainty into the best-of-$N$ (BoN) policy framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and applications to real LLM data highlight the practical value of accounting for uncertainty in reward modeling for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an "as static as possible" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of a class of iterative algorithms designed to minimize a potentially non-smooth and noisy objective function, which may be algebraically intractable and whose values may be obtained as the output of a black box. The algorithms considered can be cast under the umbrella of a generalised gradient descent recursion, where the gradient is that of a smooth approximation of the objective function. The framework we develop includes as special cases model-based and mollification methods, two classical approaches to zero-th order optimisation. The convergence results are obtained under very weak assumptions on the regularity of the objective function and involve a trade-off between the degree of smoothing and size of the steps taken in the parameter updates. As expected, additional assumptions are required in the stochastic case. We illustrate the relevance of these algorithms and our convergence results through a challenging classification example from machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce iterative tilting, a gradient-free method for fine-tuning diffusion models toward reward-tilted distributions. The method decomposes a large reward tilt $\exp(\lambda r)$ into $N$ sequential smaller tilts, each admitting a tractable score update via first-order Taylor expansion. This requires only forward evaluations of the reward function and avoids backpropagating through sampling chains. We validate on a two-dimensional Gaussian mixture with linear reward, where the exact tilted distribution is available in closed form.

Abstract: High quality data is needed to unlock the full potential of AI for end users. However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.
  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches.

Abstract: We frame novelty detection on path space as a hypothesis testing problem with signature-based test statistics. Using transportation-cost inequalities of Gasteratos and Jacquier (2023), we obtain tail bounds for false positive rates that extend beyond Gaussian measures to laws of RDE solutions with smooth bounded vector fields, yielding estimates of quantiles and p-values. Exploiting the shuffle product, we derive exact formulae for smooth surrogates of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in terms of expected signatures, leading to new one-class SVM algorithms optimising smooth CVaR objectives. We then establish lower bounds on type-$\mathrm{II}$ error for alternatives with finite first moment, giving general power bounds when the reference measure and the alternative are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. Finally, we evaluate numerically the type-$\mathrm{I}$ error and statistical power of signature-based test statistic, using synthetic anomalous diffusion data and real-world molecular biology data.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI call for a paradigm shift from bit-centric communication to goal- and semantics-oriented architectures, paving the way for AI-native 6G networks. In this context, we address a key open challenge: enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise and preserving task-relevant meaning. We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task. The resulting communication network provides new insights about semantic heterogeneity across agents, highlighting the interpretability of our methodology.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate wildfire detection is crucial for emergency response and environmental management. In airborne and spaceborne missions, real-time algorithms must distinguish between no fire, active fire, and post-fire conditions, and estimate fire intensity. Multispectral and hyperspectral thermal imagers provide rich spectral information, but high data dimensionality and limited onboard resources make real-time processing challenging. As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, the need for low-latency and computationally efficient onboard detection methods is critical.
  We present a systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures, including custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, for multi-class fire classification. We also introduce PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline that performs fire classification followed by fire radiative power (FRP) regression or segmentation to reduce inference time and computational cost for onboard deployment. Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency.
  Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.

Abstract: Cancer treatment outcomes are influenced not only by clinical and demographic factors but also by the collaboration of healthcare teams. However, prior work has largely overlooked the potential role of human collaboration in shaping patient survival. This paper presents an applied AI approach to uncovering the impact of healthcare professionals' (HCPs) collaboration-captured through electronic health record (EHR) systems-on cancer patient outcomes. We model EHR-mediated HCP interactions as networks and apply machine learning techniques to detect predictive signals of patient survival embedded in these collaborations. Our models are cross validated to ensure generalizability, and we explain the predictions by identifying key network traits associated with improved outcomes. Importantly, clinical experts and literature validate the relevance of the identified crucial collaboration traits, reinforcing their potential for real-world applications. This work contributes to a practical workflow for leveraging digital traces of collaboration and AI to assess and improve team-based healthcare. The approach is potentially transferable to other domains involving complex collaboration and offers actionable insights to support data-informed interventions in healthcare delivery.

Abstract: The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.

Abstract: The function of biomolecules such as proteins depends on their ability to interconvert between a wide range of structures or "conformations." Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.

Abstract: Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

<title>When does Gaussian equivalence fail and how to fix it: Non-universal behavior of random features with quadratic scaling</title>

Abstract: A major effort in modern high-dimensional statistics has been devoted to the analysis of linear predictors trained on nonlinear feature embeddings via empirical risk minimization (ERM). Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.
  We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.
  Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM.

Abstract: Design generation, in its essence, is a step-by-step process where designers progressively refine and enhance their work through careful modifications. Despite this fundamental characteristic, existing approaches mainly treat design synthesis as a single-step generation problem, significantly underestimating the inherent complexity of the creative process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel problem setting called Step-by-Step Layered Design Generation, which tasks a machine learning model with generating a design that adheres to a sequence of instructions from a designer. Leveraging recent advancements in multi-modal LLMs, we propose SLEDGE: Step-by-step LayEred Design GEnerator to model each update to a design as an atomic, layered change over its previous state, while being grounded in the instruction. To complement our new problem setting, we introduce a new evaluation suite, including a dataset and a benchmark. Our exhaustive experimental analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches tailored to our new setup demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We hope our work will attract attention to this pragmatic and under-explored research area.

Abstract: Ejection fraction (EF) is a crucial metric for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing conditions such as heart failure. Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\pm$2.10.

Abstract: The maximum clique problem, a well-known graph-based combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed through various algorithmic approaches, though systematic analyses of the problem instances remain sparse. This study employs the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology to systematically analyze the instance space of this problem and assess & predict the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including exact, heuristic, and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods. A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the exact algorithm Mixed Order Maximum Clique (MOMC) exhib- ited superior performance across approximately 74.7% of the instance space constituted by the compiled dataset. Gurobi & CliSAT accounted for superior performance in 13.8% and 11% of the instance space, respectively. The ISA-based algorithm performance prediction model run on 34 challenging test instances compiled from the BHOSLIB and DIMACS datasets yielded top-1 and top-2 best performing algorithm prediction accuracies of 88% and 97%, respectively.

Abstract: Understanding and representing the structure of 3D objects in an unsupervised manner remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics. Most existing unsupervised keypoint methods are not designed for unconditional generative settings, restricting their use in modern 3D generative pipelines; our formulation explicitly bridges this gap. We present an unsupervised framework for learning spatially structured 3D keypoints from point cloud data. These keypoints serve as a compact and interpretable representation that conditions an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) to reconstruct the full shape. The learned keypoints exhibit repeatable spatial structure across object instances and support smooth interpolation in keypoint space, indicating that they capture geometric variation. Our method achieves strong performance across diverse object categories, yielding a 6 percentage-point improvement in keypoint consistency compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, becoming essential tools in creative content generation and physical simulation. Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications.
  We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Decoding imagined speech engages complex neural processes that are difficult to interpret due to uncertainty in timing and the limited availability of imagined-response datasets. In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.

Abstract: In cell culture bioprocessing, real-time batch process monitoring (BPM) refers to the continuous tracking and analysis of key process variables such as viable cell density, nutrient levels, metabolite concentrations, and product titer throughout the duration of a batch run. This enables early detection of deviations and supports timely control actions to ensure optimal cell growth and product quality. BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability. The results also suggest that integrating Raman-based predictions with lagged offline measurements enhances monitoring accuracy, offering a promising direction for future bioprocess soft sensor development.

Abstract: Malicious URLs remain a primary vector for phishing, malware, and cyberthreats. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning framework combining \texttt{HashingVectorizer} n-gram analysis, SMOTE balancing, Isolation Forest anomaly filtering, and a lightweight neural network classifier for real-time URL classification. The multi-stage pipeline processes URLs from open-source repositories with statistical features (length, dot count, entropy), achieving $O(NL + EBdh)$ training complexity and a 20\,ms prediction latency. Empirical evaluation yields 96.4\% accuracy, 95.4\% F1-score, and 97.3\% ROC-AUC, outperforming CNN (94.8\%) and SVM baselines with a $50\!\times$--$100\!\times$ speedup (Table~\ref{tab:comp-complexity}). A multilingual Tkinter GUI (Arabic/English/French) enables real-time threat assessment with clipboard integration. The framework demonstrates superior scalability and resilience against obfuscated URL patterns.

Abstract: Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in the field of long-context modeling, however, their inference computational costs have become a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of tasks such as agents and multimodal applications. This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) aims to predict speakers' emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual cues. Existing approaches either struggle to capture complex cross-modal interactions or experience gradient conflicts and unstable training when using deeper architectures. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Space Synergy (CSS), which couples a representation component with an optimization component. Synergistic Polynomial Fusion (SPF) serves the representation role, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization to efficiently capture high-order cross-modal interactions. Pareto Gradient Modulator (PGM) serves the optimization role, steering updates along Pareto-optimal directions across competing objectives to alleviate gradient conflicts and improve stability. Experiments show that CSS outperforms existing representative methods on IEMOCAP and MELD in both accuracy and training stability, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed across a wide range of industrial applications where ultra-low power consumption is a critical prerequisite. At the same time, these systems must maintain a certain level of determinism to ensure reliable and predictable operation. In this view, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) is a communication technology that meets both conditions, making it an attractive option for its usage in industrial WSNs. This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

Abstract: The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/HanxiuZhang/SELF_v2.

Abstract: Transformer-based audio SSL (self-supervised learning) models often treat spectrograms as images, applying convolutional patchification with heavy temporal downsampling. This lowers the effective Nyquist frequency and introduces aliasing, while na\"ive low-pass filtering removes task-relevant high-frequency cues. In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens. AaPE integrates seamlessly into the masked teacher-student self-supervised learning. In addition, we combine a multi-mask strategy with a contrastive objective to enforce consistency across diverse mask patterns, stabilizing training. Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a subset of tasks and competitive results across the remainder. Complementary linear probing evaluation mirrors this pattern, yielding clear gains on several benchmarks and strong performance elsewhere. The collective analysis of these results indicates that AaPE serves to mitigate the effects of aliasing without discarding of informative high-frequency content.

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding

Abstract: Coarse graining (CG) is an important task for efficient modeling and simulation of complex multi-scale systems, such as the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model.

Abstract: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) encode conditional dependencies among random variables using a graph -nodes for variables, links for dependencies- and factorize the joint distribution into lower-dimensional components. This makes PGMs well-suited for analyzing complex systems and supporting decision-making. Recent advances in topological signal processing highlight the importance of variables defined on topological spaces in several application domains. In such cases, the underlying topology shapes statistical relationships, limiting the expressiveness of canonical PGMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Colored Markov Random Fields (CMRFs), which model both conditional and marginal dependencies among Gaussian edge variables on topological spaces, with a theoretical foundation in Hodge theory. CMRFs extend classical Gaussian Markov Random Fields by including link coloring: connectivity encodes conditional independence, while color encodes marginal independence. We quantify the benefits of CMRFs through a distributed estimation case study over a physical network, comparing it with baselines with different levels of topological prior.

Abstract: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.

We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training. This successful deployment demonstrates the feasibility of training RL policies terrestrially and transferring them to space-based applications. This paves the way for future work in In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM), enabling rapid on-orbit adaptation to dynamic mission requirements.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.

<title>Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from a Sequence-Level Perspective</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering tasks, but their reliance on large numbers of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.

Abstract: Egyptian hieroglyphs, the ancient Egyptian writing system, are composed entirely of drawings. Translating these glyphs into English poses various challenges, including the fact that a single glyph can have multiple meanings. Deep learning translation applications are evolving rapidly, producing remarkable results that significantly impact our lives. In this research, we propose a method for the automatic recognition and translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs from images to English. This study utilized two datasets for classification and translation: the Morris Franken dataset and the EgyptianTranslation dataset. Our approach is divided into three stages: segmentation (using Contour and Detectron2), mapping symbols to Gardiner codes, and translation (using the CNN model). The model achieved a BLEU score of 42.2, a significant result compared to previous research.

Abstract: Neural networks have become a widely adopted tool for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems from data. However, the choice of training strategy remains a key design decision, particularly for simulation tasks. This paper compares two predominant strategies: parallel and series-parallel training. The conducted empirical analysis spans five neural network architectures and two examples: a pneumatic valve test bench and an industrial robot benchmark. The study reveals that, even though series-parallel training dominates current practice, parallel training consistently yields better long-term prediction accuracy. Additionally, this work clarifies the often inconsistent terminology in the literature and relate both strategies to concepts from system identification. The findings suggest that parallel training should be considered the default training strategy for neural network-based simulation of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp generation aims to produce grasp poses that align with task requirements and human interpretable grasp semantics. However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Active suspension systems are critical for enhancing vehicle comfort, safety, and stability, yet their performance is often limited by fixed hardware designs and control strategies that cannot adapt to uncertain and dynamic operating conditions. Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end pipeline for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into spiking Sigma-Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs). We demonstrate that an ANN policy trained entirely in simulation can be transformed into an SDNN compatible with Intel's Loihi 2 architecture, enabling low-latency and energy-efficient inference. As a test case, we use an RL policy for controlling the Astrobee free-flying robot, similar to a previously hardware in space-validated controller. The policy, trained with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), is converted to an SDNN and deployed on Intel's Loihi 2, then evaluated in NVIDIA's Omniverse Isaac Lab simulation environment for closed-loop control of Astrobee's motion. We compare execution performance between GPU and Loihi 2. The results highlight the feasibility of using neuromorphic platforms for robotic control and establish a pathway toward energy-efficient, real-time neuromorphic computation in future space and terrestrial robotics applications.

Abstract: In large-scale AI training, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (s-MoE) layers enable scaling by activating only a small subset of experts per token. An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings. Together, these results build a principled framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing of s-MoE in AI models.

Abstract: Deep Image Prior (DIP) has recently emerged as a promising one-shot neural-network based image reconstruction method. However, DIP has seen limited application to 3D image reconstruction problems. In this work, we introduce Tada-DIP, a highly effective and fully 3D DIP method for solving 3D inverse problems. By combining input-adaptation and denoising regularization, Tada-DIP produces high-quality 3D reconstructions while avoiding the overfitting phenomenon that is common in DIP. Experiments on sparse-view X-ray computed tomography reconstruction validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that Tada-DIP produces much better reconstructions than training-data-free baselines and achieves reconstruction performance on par with a supervised network trained using a large dataset with fully-sampled volumes.

Abstract: Foundational Machine Learning Potentials can resolve the accuracy and transferability limitations of classical force fields. They enable microscopic insights into material behavior through Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can crucially expedite material design and discovery. However, insufficiently broad and systematically biased reference data affect the predictive quality of the learned models. Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant. Our approach is model-agnostic, applicable to multi-component systems with solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions, and compliant with top-down training on other experimental properties. Therefore, our approach can serve as an essential step towards highly accurate application-specific and foundational machine learning potentials.

Abstract: The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/PSA

Abstract: The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are widely and successfully used for probabilistic wind power forecasting, yet the pervasive issue of missing values (e.g., due to sensor faults or communication outages) has received limited attention. The prevailing practice is impute-then-predict, but conditioning on point imputations biases parameter estimates and fails to propagate uncertainty from missing features. Our approach treats missing features and forecast targets uniformly: we learn a joint generative model of features and targets from incomplete data and, at operational deployment, condition on the observed features and marginalize the unobserved ones to produce forecasts. This imputation-free procedure avoids error introduced by imputation and preserves uncertainty aroused from missing features. In experiments, it improves forecast quality in terms of continuous ranked probability score relative to impute-then-predict baselines while incurring substantially lower computational cost than common alternatives.

Abstract: This paper presents a philosophical and experimental study of fairness interventions in AI classification, centered on the explainability of corrective methods. We argue that ensuring fairness requires not only satisfying a target criterion, but also explaining which variables constrain its realization. When corrections are used to mitigate advantage transparently, they must remain sensitive to the distribution of true labels. To illustrate this approach, we built FairDream, a fairness package whose mechanism is made transparent for lay users, increasing the model's weights of errors on disadvantaged groups. While a user may intend to achieve Demographic Parity by the correction method, experiments show that FairDream tends towards Equalized Odds, revealing a conservative bias inherent to the data environment. We clarify the relationship between these fairness criteria, analyze FairDream's reweighting process, and compare its trade-offs with closely related GridSearch models. Finally, we justify the normative preference for Equalized Odds via an epistemological interpretation of the results, using their proximity with Simpson's paradox.

Abstract: The Rectified Power Unit (RePU) activation function, a differentiable generalization of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), has shown promise in constructing neural networks due to its smoothness properties. However, deep RePU networks often suffer from critical issues such as vanishing or exploding values during training, rendering them unstable regardless of hyperparameter initialization. Leveraging the perspective of effective field theory, we identify the root causes of these failures and propose the Modified Rectified Power Unit (MRePU) activation function. MRePU addresses RePU's limitations while preserving its advantages, such as differentiability and universal approximation properties. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MRePU satisfies criticality conditions necessary for stable training, placing it in a distinct universality class. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MRePU, showing significant improvements in training stability and performance across various tasks, including polynomial regression, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and real-world vision tasks. Our findings highlight the potential of MRePU as a robust alternative for building deep neural networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration properties of cumulative reward in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We introduce a unified approach to characterize reward concentration in MDPs, covering both infinite-horizon settings (i.e., average and discounted reward frameworks) and finite-horizon setting. Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a martingale decomposition of cumulative reward, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences.

Abstract: We introduce a method based on Conformal Prediction (CP) to quantify the uncertainty of full ranking algorithms. We focus on a specific scenario where $n+m$ items are to be ranked by some ``black box'' algorithm. It is assumed that the relative (ground truth) ranking of $n$ of them is known. The objective is then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new items among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$ original items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the $m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to apply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct distribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results on the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we provide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item. We also control the false coverage proportion, a crucial quantity when dealing with multiple prediction sets. Finally, we empirically show on both synthetic and real data the efficiency of our CP method for state-of-the-art algorithms such as RankNet or LambdaMart.

Abstract: Chemical Language Models (CLMs) leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in de novo molecular design, yet often suffer from mode collapse, limiting their exploration capabilities. Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on temporal graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is essential for flood management, transportation, energy system operations, and emergency response. However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the extensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation data alone. This study examines whether integrating multi-variable weather-station measurements with radar can enhance nowcasting skill and introduces two complementary architectures that integrate multi-variable station data with radar images. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network; The SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration . Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather station data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather nowcasting models.

Abstract: Deep tabular models have demonstrated remarkable success on i.i.d. data, excelling in a variety of structured data tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection performs. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, on-policy algorithms used for post-training are not naturally robust to a diversified content of experience replay buffers, which asynchronous off-policy actors can efficiently populate in parallel to training. We propose efficiently learning on such off-policy data via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), an approach to asynchronous RL for LLMs that leverages the principled off-policy TB objective. On math, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming tasks, we post-train models ranging from Pythia 410M to Qwen 2.5 7B, finding TBA offers speed and performance boosts over strong baselines like Online DPO and Dr. GRPO. Beyond TBA's performance benefits (high accuracy even as asynchrony grows) and speedups ($4\times$ or more), we show its reward- and recency-prioritizing sampling enable further gains as data generation is scaled. Our code is available at https://github.com/bbartoldson/TBA.

Abstract: Machine learning-based closure models for LES have shown promise in capturing complex turbulence dynamics but often suffer from instabilities and physical inconsistencies. In this work, we develop a novel skew-symmetric neural architecture as closure model that enforces stability while preserving key physical conservation laws. Our approach leverages a discretization that ensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with a face-averaging filter to maintain mass conservation in coarse-grained velocity fields. We compare our model against several conventional data-driven closures (including unconstrained convolutional neural networks), and the physics-based Smagorinsky model. Performance is evaluated on decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow for multiple coarse-graining factors. In these test cases we observe that unconstrained machine learning models suffer from numerical instabilities. In contrast, our skew-symmetric model remains stable across all tests, though at the cost of increased dissipation. Despite this trade-off, we demonstrate that our model still outperforms the Smagorinsky model in unseen scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of structure-preserving machine learning closures for reliable long-time LES.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting cross-cluster interactions. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and directional information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of wearable sensors has the potential to provide massive and heterogeneous time series data, driving the use of Artificial Intelligence in human sensing applications. However, data collection remains limited due to stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints, hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate both data scarcity and privacy issues. However, these models are often limited to narrow operational scenarios, such as short-term and unimodal signal patterns. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time series data, explicitly assessing their performance in challenging scenarios such as stress and emotion recognition. Our study examines the extent to which these models can jointly handle multi-modality, capture long-range dependencies, and support conditional generation-core requirements for real-world wearable sensor data generation. To enable a fair and rigorous comparison, we also introduce an evaluation framework that evaluates both the intrinsic fidelity of the generated data and their utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of generative models in the wearable computing domain.

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, structurally resembling bilinear systems. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Bilinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Bilinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras. Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED produces curricula that improve zero-shot generalization over strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the transition-prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that Co-Learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition-prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel perspective on the underlying structure of real-world data with ground-truth clusters via characterization of an abundantly observed yet often overlooked density-geometry correlation, that manifests itself as a multi-layered manifold structure.
  We leverage this correlation to design CoreSPECT (Core Space Projection based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques), a general framework that improves the performance of generic clustering algorithms. Our framework boosts the performance of clustering algorithms by applying them to strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We provide initial theoretical support of the functionality of our framework under the assumption of our model, and then provide large-scale real-world experiments on 19 datasets that include standard image datasets as well as genomics datasets.
  We observe two notable improvements. First, CoreSPECT improves the NMI of K-Means by 20% on average, making it competitive to (and in some cases surpassing) the state-of-the-art manifold-based clustering algorithms, while being orders of magnitude faster.
  Secondly, our framework boosts the NMI of HDBSCAN by more than 100% on average, making it competitive to the state-of-the-art in several cases without requiring the true number of clusters and hyper-parameter tuning. The overall ARI improvements are higher.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks. However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models. Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels, resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models. Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/SparseModels .

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data cleaning stage.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market conditions. We propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware System (MARS), a novel framework addressing this through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. MARS replaces monolithic models with a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble, where each agent's unique risk profile is enforced by a Safety-Critic network to span behaviors from capital preservation to aggressive growth. A high-level Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) dynamically orchestrates this ensemble, shifting reliance between conservative and aggressive agents to minimize drawdown during downturns while seizing opportunities in bull markets. This two-tiered structure leverages behavioral diversity rather than explicit feature engineering to ensure a disciplined portfolio robust across market regimes. Experiments on major international indexes confirm that our framework significantly reduces maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success, its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the environment.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a promising policy-based approach for Large Language Model alignment, yet its performance is often limited by training instability and suboptimal convergence. In this paper, we identify and analyze two main GRPO issues: (i) the token-level penalization, where valuable tokens shared across different responses receive contradictory feedback signals, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their likelihood; and (ii) the policy collapse, where negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, destabilizing training process. To address these issues we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which prevents conflicting gradients on valuable tokens by skipping negative updates while amplifying positive ones and filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold, to prevent policy collapse. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, as validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH, AIME 2024, AIME 2025 and AMC 2023.

Abstract: Ensuring the resilience of computer-based railways is increasingly crucial to account for uncertainties and changes due to the growing complexity and criticality of those systems. Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 and MP-20 datasets. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, one with enantiomorphs, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose new splits for datasets with polymorphs, ensuring that polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth) models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We show that RevDEQs significantly improve performance on language modelling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date, continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the behaviour of the agent is directed towards optimizing a measure of long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with continual learning. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results, which show the intuitive appeal of ergodic risk measures in continual settings.

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for text generation and are becoming a competitive alternative to autoregressive models. The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: Despite the frequent use of agent-based models (ABMs) for studying social phenomena, parameter estimation remains a challenge, often relying on costly simulation-based heuristics. This work uses variational inference to estimate the parameters of an opinion dynamics ABM, by transforming the estimation problem into an optimization task that can be solved directly.
  Our proposal relies on probabilistic generative ABMs (PGABMs): we start by synthesizing a probabilistic generative model from the ABM rules. Then, we transform the inference process into an optimization problem suitable for automatic differentiation. In particular, we use the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization for categorical agent attributes and stochastic variational inference for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we explore the trade-offs of using variational distributions with different complexity: normal distributions and normalizing flows.
  We validate our method on a bounded confidence model with agent roles (leaders and followers). Our approach estimates both macroscopic (bounded confidence intervals and backfire thresholds) and microscopic ($200$ categorical, agent-level roles) more accurately than simulation-based and MCMC methods. Consequently, our technique enables experts to tune and validate their ABMs against real-world observations, thus providing insights into human behavior in social systems via data-driven analysis.

Abstract: The tremendous hype around autonomous driving is eagerly calling for emerging and novel technologies to support advanced mobility use cases. As car manufactures keep developing SAE level 3+ systems to improve the safety and comfort of passengers, traffic authorities need to establish new procedures to manage the transition from human-driven to fully-autonomous vehicles while providing a feedback-loop mechanism to fine-tune envisioned autonomous systems. Thus, a way to automatically profile autonomous vehicles and differentiate those from human-driven ones is a must. In this paper, we present a fully-fledged framework that monitors active vehicles using camera images and state information in order to determine whether vehicles are autonomous, without requiring any active notification from the vehicles themselves. Essentially, it builds on the cooperation among vehicles, which share their data acquired on the road feeding a machine learning model to identify autonomous cars. We extensively tested our solution and created the NexusStreet dataset, by means of the CARLA simulator, employing an autonomous driving control agent and a steering wheel maneuvered by licensed drivers. Experiments show it is possible to discriminate the two behaviors by analyzing video clips with an accuracy of 80%, which improves up to 93% when the target state information is available. Lastly, we deliberately degraded the state to observe how the framework performs under non-ideal data collection conditions.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

<title>How to Train Long-Context Language Models (Effectively)</title>

Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

Abstract: Remote sensing has evolved from simple image acquisition to complex systems capable of integrating and processing visual and textual data. This review examines the development and application of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) in remote sensing, focusing on their ability to interpret and describe satellite imagery using natural language. We cover the technical underpinnings of MLLMs, including dual-encoder architectures, Transformer models, self-supervised and contrastive learning, and cross-modal integration. The unique challenges of remote sensing data--varying spatial resolutions, spectral richness, and temporal changes--are analyzed for their impact on MLLM performance. Key applications such as scene description, object detection, change detection, text-to-image retrieval, image-to-text generation, and visual question answering are discussed to demonstrate their relevance in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. We review significant datasets and resources supporting the training and evaluation of these models. Challenges related to computational demands, scalability, data quality, and domain adaptation are highlighted. We conclude by proposing future research directions and technological advancements to further enhance MLLM utility in remote sensing.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making policies from experts, leveraging offline demonstrations, interactive annotations, or both. Recent advances show that when annotation cost is tallied per trajectory, Behavior Cloning (BC) which relies solely on offline demonstrations cannot be improved in general, leaving limited conditions for interactive methods such as DAgger to help. We revisit this conclusion and prove that when the annotation cost is measured per state, algorithms using interactive annotations can provably outperform BC. Specifically: (1) we show that Stagger, a one sample per round variant of DAgger, provably beats BC under low recovery cost settings; (2) we initiate the study of hybrid IL where the agent learns from offline demonstrations and interactive annotations. We propose Warm Stagger whose learning guarantee is not much worse than using either data source alone. Furthermore, motivated by compounding error and cold start problem in imitation learning practice, we give an MDP example in which Warm Stagger has significant better annotation cost; (3) experiments on MuJoCo continuous control tasks confirm that, with modest cost ratio between interactive and offline annotations, interactive and hybrid approaches consistently outperform BC. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to highlight the benefit of state wise interactive annotation and hybrid feedback in imitation learning.

Abstract: We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/uiucsn/ELAsTiCC-Classification).

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how small language models (SLMs) can be scaled to support multimodal search and recommendation use cases while remaining efficient enough for real-time, resource-constrained deployments. We present a framework that combines upside-down reinforcement learning with synthetic data distillation from a large language model (Llama-3) to train a 100M-parameter GPT-2 model for multitask prompt generation. Despite being up to 80 times smaller than state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), our SLM achieves relevance and diversity scores within 6% of competitive baselines such as Llama-3 8B, Qwen3 8B, and Ministral 8B. These results demonstrate that SLMs can effectively handle multimodal search and recommendation tasks, while dramatically reducing inference latency and memory overhead. Our study highlights the potential of lightweight models as practical engines for scalable multimodal discovery, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world multimodal applications such as media recommendations and creative content generation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires understanding infrastructure elements, such as lanes and crosswalks. To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV feature grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining easy to integrate compared to other hybrid approaches. It additionally benefits from extra processing on its latent BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements on vectorized map prediction of up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60 m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline, SQD-MapNet, and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement.

Abstract: Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN) to, which provides simulated values of $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which can hence be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. Our method is applied to simulated data and to a financial data set from the Kenneth French Data Library. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data and in generating accurate new extremes.

Abstract: Adaptive beam switching is essential for mission-critical military and commercial 6G networks but faces major challenges from high carrier frequencies, user mobility, and frequent blockages. While existing machine learning (ML) solutions often focus on maximizing instantaneous throughput, this can lead to unstable policies with high signaling overhead. This paper presents an online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework designed to learn an operationally stable policy. By equipping the DRL agent with an enhanced state representation that includes blockage history, and a stability-centric reward function, we enable it to prioritize long-term link quality over transient gains. Validated in a challenging 100-user scenario using the Sionna library, our agent achieves throughput comparable to a reactive Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) baseline. Specifically, our proposed framework improves link stability by approximately 43% compared to a vanilla DRL approach, achieving operational reliability competitive with MAB while maintaining high data rates. This work demonstrates that by reframing the optimization goal towards operational stability, DRL can deliver efficient, reliable, and real-time beam management solutions for next-generation mission-critical networks.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query, balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy, where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models, which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different embedding models.

Abstract: Context: Open-source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored to Software Engineering (SE) needs to support the reliable identification and reuse of models for SE. Objective: To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Method: Our repository mining study followed a five-phase pipeline: (i) identification SE tasks from the literature; (ii) collection of PTM data from the HF API, including model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstracts of the associated arXiv papers; (iii) text processing to ensure consistency; (iv) a two-phase validation of SE relevance, involving humans and LLM assistance, supported by five pilot studies with human annotators and a generalization test; (v) and data analysis. This process yielded a curated catalogue of 2,205 SE PTMs. Results: We find that most SE PTMs target code generation and coding, emphasizing implementation over early or late development stages. In terms of ML tasks, text generation dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly since 2023 Q2, while evaluation remains limited: only 9.6% report benchmark results, mostly scoring below 50%. Conclusions: Our catalogue reveals documentation and transparency gaps, highlights imbalances across SDLC phases, and provides a foundation for automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics while generating up to 39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more than 8,000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to two out-of-distribution tasks, namely GPQA and Countdown, with up to 45% and 65% reduction in average sequential tokens respectively for longer reasoning trajectories, while matching the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activation space is an important topic in mechanistic interpretability. Numerous automated interpretability methods have been proposed to generate such explanations, but it remains unclear how reliable these explanations are, and which methods produce the most accurate descriptions. While crowd-sourced evaluations are commonly used, existing pipelines are noisy, costly, and typically assess only the highest-activating inputs, leading to unreliable results. In this paper, we introduce two techniques to enable cost-effective and accurate crowdsourced evaluation of automated interpretability methods beyond top activating inputs. First, we propose Model-Guided Importance Sampling (MG-IS) to select the most informative inputs to show human raters. In our experiments, we show this reduces the number of inputs needed to reach the same evaluation accuracy by ~13x. Second, we address label noise in crowd-sourced ratings through Bayesian Rating Aggregation (BRAgg), which allows us to reduce the number of ratings per input required to overcome noise by ~3x. Together, these techniques reduce the evaluation cost by ~40x, making large-scale evaluation feasible. Finally, we use our methods to conduct a large scale crowd-sourced study comparing recent automated interpretability methods for vision networks.

<title>Blameless Users in a Clean Room: Defining Copyright Protection for Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright deduplication requirement.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through user-submitted images.

Abstract: Learning to Optimize (L2O) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) in which ML models are trained to solve parametric optimization problems. The general goal is to learn a fast approximator of solutions to constrained optimization problems, as a function of their defining parameters. Prior L2O methods focus almost entirely on single-level programs, in contrast to the bilevel programs, whose constraints are themselves expressed in terms of optimization subproblems. Bilevel programs have numerous important use cases but are notoriously difficult to solve, particularly under stringent time demands. This paper proposes a framework for learning to solve a broad class of challenging bilevel optimization problems, by leveraging modern techniques for differentiation through optimization problems. The framework is illustrated on an array of synthetic bilevel programs, as well as challenging control system co-design problems, showing how neural networks can be trained as efficient approximators of parametric bilevel optimization.

Abstract: The increasing need for robustness, reliability, and determinism in wireless networks for industrial and mission-critical applications is the driver for the growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded and industrial systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation but remain constrained by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code, leaving debugging largely unsolved. While Claude 4.5 Opus achieves 74.40% on SWE-bench Verified and Gemini 3 Pro reaches 76.2%, both models remain below 20% on real multi-file debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos-1, a language model purpose-built for debugging that integrates Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on over 15 million sessions, and a seven-layer fix-test-refine architecture. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos-1 achieves 67.3% +/- 2.1% fix accuracy compared to 14.2% +/- 1.3% for Claude 4.1 Opus and 13.8% +/- 1.2% for GPT-4.1 (Cohen's d = 3.87). On SWE-bench Lite, Chronos-1 reaches a state-of-the-art 80.33% resolution rate (241 of 300), outperforming the next best system by 20 points and achieving repository-specific highs of 96.1% on Sympy and 90.4% on Django. Chronos-1 reduces debugging time by 40% and iterations by 65%, resolving complex multi-file and cross-repository bugs that require temporal analysis. Limitations remain for hardware-dependent and dynamic language errors, and Chronos-1 will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning. Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/Astra.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, researchers often face substantial barriers in effectively using these data for translational research due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and lack of standardized tools and documentation. To address this critical gap, we introduce PEHRT, a common pipeline for harmonizing EHR data for translational research. PEHRT is a comprehensive, ready-to-use resource that includes open-source code, visualization tools, and detailed documentation to streamline the process of preparing EHR data for analysis. The pipeline provides tools to harmonize structured and unstructured EHR data to standardized ontologies to ensure consistency across diverse coding systems. In the presence of unmapped or heterogeneous local codes, PEHRT further leverages representation learning and pre-trained language models to generate robust embeddings that capture semantic relationships across sites to mitigate heterogeneity and enable integrative downstream analyses. PEHRT also supports cross-institutional co-training through shared representations, allowing participating sites to collaboratively refine embeddings and enhance generalizability without sharing individual-level data. The framework is data model-agnostic and can be seamlessly deployed across diverse healthcare systems to produce interoperable, research-ready datasets. By lowering the technical barriers to EHR-based research, PEHRT empowers investigators to transform raw clinical data into reproducible, analysis-ready resources for discovery and innovation.

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses. State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DeLiVER datasets. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/timbroed/DGFusion

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational support, yet their response quality varies depending on the language of interaction. This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.

<title>Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a general computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference \& Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on two distinct ISPs: a canonical agricultural landscape management problem and a carbon-aware EV charging time slot usage problem. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated agent behavior with system-level goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a implementable set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm, self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning when pursuing state-of-the-art on AudioSet. A key reason is that global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial token information about dispersed, localized events in audio. This weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (globally) and the downstream task (localized). Across a comprehensive benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we investigate the global pooling bottleneck. We introduce binarized prototypical probes: a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging the reliance on costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Fed-Span: \textit{\underline{fed}erated learning with \underline{span}ning aggregation over low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations}. Fed-Span aims to address critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span leverages minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies to introduce spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby integrating these topologies into a distributed learning framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for Fed-Span, accommodating its key system characteristics and degrees of freedom (i.e., tunable parameters). Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of {Fed-Span}. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the substantial computational cost of slow, multi-step sampling. Although Consistency Models (CMs) address this limitation by enabling high-quality generation in only one or a few steps, their direct application to inverse problems has remained largely unexplored. This paper introduces a modified consistency sampling framework specifically designed for inverse problems. The proposed approach regulates the sampler's stochasticity through a measurement-consistency mechanism that leverages the degradation operator, thereby enforcing fidelity to the observed data while preserving the computational efficiency of consistency-based generation. Comprehensive experiments on the Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements across both perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), compared with baseline consistency and diffusion-based sampling methods. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior reconstruction quality with only a small number of sampling steps.

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

<title>Cross-Field Interface-Aware Neural Operators for Multiphase Flow Simulation</title>

Abstract: Multiphase flow simulation is critical in science and engineering but incurs high computational costs due to complex field discontinuities and the need for high-resolution numerical meshes. While Neural Operators (NOs) offer an efficient alternative for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), they struggle with two core challenges unique to multiphase systems: spectral bias caused by spatial heterogeneity at phase interfaces, and the persistent scarcity of expensive, high-resolution field data. This work introduces the Interface Information Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel architecture that mitigates these issues by leveraging readily obtainable interface data (e.g., topology and position). Interface data inherently contains the high-frequency features not only necessary to complement the physical field data, but also help with spectral bias. IANO incorporates an interface-aware function encoding mechanism to capture dynamic coupling, and a geometry-aware positional encoding method to enhance spatial fidelity for pointwise super-resolution. Empirical results across multiple multiphase flow cases demonstrate that IANO achieves significant accuracy improvements (up to $\sim$10\%) over existing NO baselines. Furthermore, IANO exhibits superior generalization capabilities in low-data and noisy settings, confirming its utility for practical, data-efficient $\text{AI}$-based multiphase flow simulations.

Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/AutoEnv.

Abstract: Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task becomes disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that continuum percolation is uniquely suited to this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous correspondence between the topological phase transitions of random geometric graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we show that this metric captures structural pathologies, such as implicit mode collapse, where standard statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function that guides training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but also fosters a form of synergistic improvement, where topological stability becomes a prerequisite for sustained high fidelity in both static generation and sequential decision making.

<div> Consensus-Based Optimization, neural networks, mean-field limit, optimal transport, multi-task learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article explores the use of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) for training two-layer neural networks. The authors compare CBO’s performance against the widely-used Adam optimizer on two test cases, highlighting differences in convergence behavior. They demonstrate that a hybrid method combining CBO and Adam accelerates convergence beyond what CBO achieves alone. Furthermore, the paper addresses challenges in multi-task learning by reformulating CBO to reduce memory overhead, making it more efficient for problems with multiple tasks. To provide a rigorous theoretical foundation, the authors recast CBO within the optimal transport framework, enabling a mean-field limit formulation as the number of particles approaches infinity. This advanced formulation operates on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space, a sophisticated mathematical space capturing distributions of probability measures. Importantly, they prove that within this limit the variance of the system decreases monotonically, indicating stable and convergent dynamics. Overall, the work bridges optimization algorithms, neural network training, multi-task learning, and mathematical analysis through mean-field theory, presenting both practical improvements and a strong theoretical understanding of CBO methods. <div>

Abstract: We study Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) for two-layer neural network training. We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. Additionally, in the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. In the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Abstract: A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision. In our study, we proposed and developed a React Native-based application with a Python Flask backend to support early diabetes prediction, providing users with an accessible and efficient health monitoring tool.

<div> Keywords: ligand-based drug discovery, pharmacophore modeling, voxel-based generative model, VoxCap, de-novo design  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses key limitations in ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD), particularly the inefficiency and restriction to existing libraries in traditional pharmacophore-shape based virtual screening methods. The authors propose a novel voxel-based generative model called VoxCap, which effectively generates SMILES strings from voxelized molecular representations. Two practical workflows are introduced: (1) a de-novo design workflow that generates new molecules exhibiting high pharmacophore-shape similarity to known binders, enhancing hit diversity and scaffold hopping capabilities, and (2) a fast search workflow that combines generative design with inexpensive 2D substructure similarity searches to drastically improve computational efficiency. VoxCap demonstrates significant improvements over previous methods by producing more diverse de-novo hits and reducing search times by orders of magnitude, making it feasible to screen very large molecular libraries that are otherwise computationally prohibitive for brute force methods. These advances provide scalable and fecund solutions to pharmacophore-based virtual screening, potentially accelerating hit identification and drug discovery processes. <div>
arXiv:2512.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

<div> Boundary Element Method, Multiple Scattering, Graph Neural Network, Physics-Inspired, Multiscale Architecture<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article addresses the computational challenges of solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). BEM reduces computational complexity by discretizing only the domain boundaries rather than the entire volume. The main bottleneck is solving the boundary integral equation to determine the solution trace on domain boundaries. To overcome this, the authors propose PIBNet, a physics-inspired, graph-based neural network designed to approximate the solution trace efficiently. This network models obstacles and their long-range interactions using a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture tailored for multiple scattering simulations. The approach leverages graph representations to encapsulate physical interactions effectively. To validate and benchmark PIBNet, the authors introduce several datasets representing various multiple scattering scenarios. Experimental results show that PIBNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency on the examined tasks. Additionally, PIBNet displays strong generalization capabilities, handling problems with a larger number of obstacles than those seen during training. The method thus offers a promising data-driven alternative to traditional numerical solvers for complex scattering problems, balancing physical fidelity and computational speed. The implementation is publicly available at github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet. <div>
arXiv:2512.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

<div> Keywords: SFL Transformer, Contextual Gating, feature fusion, lyrical content classification, BERT encoder

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study presents the SFL Transformer, an innovative model that enhances feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention layers of a pre-trained Transformer rather than at the output stage. The key advancement is the introduction of a Contextual Gating mechanism, referred to as Intermediate SFL, which modulates the sequence of hidden states (Hseq) within the BERT encoder stack using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). This approach allows deeper and more effective synergistic combination of structural and semantic information. The model is evaluated on a binary classification task based on UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings, achieving an outstanding Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Additionally, the method demonstrates exceptional reliability with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and a minimal Log Loss of 0.0489, indicating highly accurate probability estimates. Overall, the results validate the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack in a Transformer architecture is an effective strategy for improving discriminative performance and producing well-calibrated predictions in lyrical content classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence for Engineering, few-shot learning, physics-informed modeling, symbolic regression, hot-cracking prediction<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses two key challenges in applying AI to engineering—limited high-quality data and lack of model interpretability—especially in critical fields like aerospace. It proposes an explainable few-shot AI4E framework that integrates physics and expert knowledge directly into its structure. Beginning with only 32 experimental samples from repair welding on K439B superalloy castings, the method generates physically consistent synthetic data via a three-step process: calibrated noise injection, enforcement of physical constraints, and preservation of parameter relationships. A nested optimization method is then used for constitutive model discovery, combining symbolic regression to find equation forms with differential evolution for parameter tuning, finalized by hybrid global-local refinement. The resultant interpretable constitutive equation predicts hot-cracking tendency with 88% accuracy and gives explicit physical insights into the coupling of thermal, geometric, and metallurgical factors causing cracking. Beyond prediction, the equation acts as a tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data creation, improving other data-driven models. This approach offers a generalizable blueprint for trustworthy AI in safety-sensitive industrial applications where data scarcity exists but domain knowledge is strong. <div>

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

<title>Ada-MoGE: Adaptive Mixture of Gaussian Expert Model for Time Series Forecasting</title>

<div> Keywords: multivariate time series, adaptive MoE, frequency distribution, Gaussian band-pass filtering, spectral intensity<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses challenges in multivariate time series forecasting where dominant frequencies shift over time, complicating effective modeling. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models use a fixed number of experts, which cannot adapt to evolving spectral distributions, causing frequency coverage imbalance. Having too few experts risks missing critical information, whereas too many experts introduce noise. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model that dynamically determines the number of experts based on spectral intensity and frequency response alignment with the input data’s frequency distribution. This adaptive strategy prevents both information loss due to insufficient experts and noise contamination from excess experts. Additionally, the model employs Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose frequency domain features, avoiding noise that arises from abrupt band truncations common in traditional techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Ada-MoGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across six public multivariate time series benchmarks, while maintaining a lightweight architecture with only 0.2 million parameters. This shows the model’s effectiveness in accurately capturing shifting spectral characteristics with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

<div> Long-term time series forecasting, DPWMixer, Haar Wavelet Pyramid, Dual-Path Trend Mixer, multi-scale fusion<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper addresses the challenges in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), focusing on improving model efficiency and accuracy.<br />2. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies effectively but face issues like quadratic computational complexity and overfitting due to limited data.<br />3. Efficient linear models are inadequate for modeling complex and nonlinear local dynamics in time series data.<br />4. Current multi-scale approaches generally use average pooling, which acts as a low-pass filter and causes spectral aliasing and loss of important high-frequency information.<br />5. The authors introduce DPWMixer, a Dual-Path architecture based on a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid, which replaces traditional pooling with orthogonal decomposition to separate trends from local fluctuations without losing information.<br />6. DPWMixer utilizes a Dual-Path Trend Mixer comprising a global linear mapping for capturing macro trends and a patch-based MLP-Mixer to model micro-level dynamics.<br />7. An adaptive multi-scale fusion module integrates predictions from multiple scales, weighting them according to channel stationarity to optimize overall performance.<br />8. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that DPWMixer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.<br />9. The code for DPWMixer is publicly available, fostering transparency and reproducibility in future research. <div>

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>HTG-GCL: Leveraging Hierarchical Topological Granularity from Cellular Complexes for Graph Contrastive Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: graph contrastive learning, topological granularity, hierarchical structures, multi-scale cellular complexes, uncertainty weighting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses limitations in current Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods, particularly their inability to effectively identify task-relevant topological structures in graphs and to adapt across different topological granularities required by diverse downstream tasks.<br /><br />2. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that generates multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes from the same graph, capturing hierarchical topological granularity and thus creating varied topological views.<br /><br />3. Recognizing that not all granularities are equally informative, the framework incorporates a multi-granularity decoupled contrast mechanism combined with a granularity-specific weighting scheme that relies on uncertainty estimation to mitigate the influence of misleading semantics.<br /><br />4. The integration of these components enables HTG-GCL to learn richer and more discriminative graph representations by effectively capturing hierarchical topological information.<br /><br />5. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that HTG-GCL surpasses existing GCL methods in performance, validating its efficacy and robustness in diverse graph learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal data regression, federated feature extraction, contrastive learning, non-IID data, catastrophic forgetting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study addresses the challenge of feature extraction in multi-modal data regression, focusing on real-world issues including limited, non-IID datasets, effective fusion of multi-modal information, and model susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting. It introduces a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method that integrates multi-modal information extraction with contrastive learning. The approach is versatile, allowing different neural network architectures as latent mapping functions tailored to each data modality. Each client independently learns low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, with adjustable parameters to control retention of predictive information related to the response variable. The method employs a multi-constraint learning framework guided by Mean Squared Error loss to ensure regression accuracy. Key constraints include mutual information preservation for retaining task-relevant information, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence for feature extraction, fusion, and alignment, and inter-model contrastive loss to combat representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID contexts. This design keeps feature extraction focused on enhancing downstream regression task performance. Experimental results on both simulations and real-world datasets demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional feature extraction techniques in improving regression outcomes. <div>

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

<div> autonomous pricing, reinforcement learning, collusion, demand shocks, duopoly models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper analyzes the behavior of four autonomous pricing algorithms—Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG—within three classic duopoly market models: Logit, Hotelling, and Linear. The study incorporates various demand-shock regimes generated by auto-regressive processes to simulate realistic demand conditions. Using profit- and price-based collusion indices, the researchers examine how the interaction between algorithms, market structures, and stochastic demand influences competitive outcomes. It is found that reinforcement-learning algorithms often maintain supra-competitive pricing under stable demand, with the DDPG algorithm showing the strongest collusive behavior. The response to demand shocks varies by market type: Logit markets experience significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets see an increase in profits as a result of shocks. Despite changes in absolute performance metrics, the relative performance ranking among the algorithms remains consistent across different environments. These findings highlight the significant roles that market structure and demand uncertainty play in shaping algorithmic competition and offer valuable insights for ongoing policy discussions concerning the regulation of autonomous pricing algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

<div> Keywords: ECG, self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, clinical metadata, foundation models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The study presents CLEF, a novel contrastive learning approach for pretraining ECG foundation models by incorporating clinical metadata, specifically clinical risk scores, to adaptively weight negative pairs during training. Unlike previous self-supervised methods, CLEF aligns ECG embeddings with meaningful clinical differences and includes a mechanism to handle missing metadata. The models were pretrained on 12-lead ECG data from 161,000 patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset without requiring annotations for individual ECG samples. CLEF was evaluated on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across seven external datasets and benchmarked against multiple state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms and foundation models. Results show that when pretrained on 12-lead data and tested on single-lead (lead-I) data, CLEF consistently outperforms self-supervised baselines, achieving at least a 2.6% improvement in average AUROC for classification tasks and a 3.2% reduction in mean absolute errors for regression. Compared to other self-supervised learning methods, CLEF improves AUROC by at least 1.8%. Additionally, when trained only on lead-I data for classification, CLEF performs comparably to supervised state-of-the-art ECGFounder. The work advances scalable, accurate single-lead ECG analysis, with potential applications in remote cardiovascular health monitoring. Code and pretrained models are publicly available. <div>
arXiv:2512.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring.

The paper introduces Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), a novel extension of sparse autoencoders aimed at improving interpretability and consistency in learned neural network features.<br /><br />2. OSAEs build on the concept of Matryoshka sparse autoencoders but add two significant innovations: the establishment of a strict ordering of latent features and deterministic usage of every feature dimension, eliminating reliance on sampling-based approximations used in prior methods.<br /><br />3. The authors provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that OSAEs address permutation non-identifiability issues in sparse dictionary learning, ensuring that learned solutions are unique except for inherent symmetries.<br /><br />4. Empirically, OSAEs were tested on large language models Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, where they showed improved consistency in feature representations compared to Matryoshka sparse autoencoder baselines.<br /><br />5.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

The paper explores the Doughnut framework, which integrates social and planetary boundaries to assess sustainability. 2. It presents a proof-of-concept demonstrating how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simplified macroeconomic model based on the Doughnut concept. 3. Initially, ML techniques, such as a Random Forest Classifier, are used to identify policy parameters that enable living within the Doughnut’s ecological and social limits. 4. Subsequently, reinforcement learning, specifically $Q$-learning, is employed to discover an optimal policy trajectory within the parameter space that guides decision-making towards sustainable outcomes. 5. The study highlights that these frugal ML methods can effectively find combinations of policies that satisfy both environmental and social sustainability criteria. 6. Finally, the paper suggests that future work will involve extending these approaches to more complex ecological macroeconomic models, paving the way for more robust and applicable sustainability policy tools. <div>

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

<div> Keywords: low-resource languages, instruction datasets, large language models, quality filtering, multi-domain benchmarks<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs), particularly those spoken across Africa, due to the scarcity of high-quality instruction datasets. Existing methods like automated translation and synthetic data generation often result in outputs lacking fluency and orthographic consistency. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose InstructLR, a novel framework that combines large language model-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering system. The first filtering layer is automated, leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting mechanism to ensure initial data quality. This is complemented by a human-in-the-loop validation layer to further enhance dataset reliability and correctness. Drawing inspiration from established benchmarks such as MMLU for task definition, InstructLR has enabled the creation of three comprehensive multi-domain instruction benchmarks for African LRLs: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k. These benchmarks aim to facilitate improved support and development of large language models capable of handling diverse and complex tasks in these underrepresented languages, advancing the field of language technology inclusivity and performance for LRLs. <div>

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

<div> Keywords: online model selection, reinforcement learning, resource allocation, non-stationary dynamics, training stability<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of online model selection within reinforcement learning (RL), proposing methods that enable a selector to adaptively choose the most suitable RL agent configuration from a given set. The central objective is to improve training efficiency and overall performance by incorporating online model selection into RL workflows. The authors analyze theoretical conditions supporting the identification of optimal configurations, focusing on three practical criteria: (1) efficient allocation of computational and data resources to avoid wasteful training, (2) adaptation capabilities under non-stationary or changing environmental dynamics, ensuring robustness over time, and (3) stability of training outcomes across different random seeds to guarantee reliable performance. Theoretical insights are complemented by empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on multiple model selection tasks, such as choosing neural network architectures, tuning step-sizes, and enabling self model selection procedures. These findings suggest that integrating online model selection strategies in reinforcement learning can lead to measurable improvements in efficiency, adaptability, and reproducibility of RL training processes. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of online model selection in reinforcement learning, where the selector has access to a class of reinforcement learning agents and learns to adaptively select the agent with the right configuration. Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

<div> Keywords: photonic Bayesian machine, uncertainty reasoning, chaotic light sources, Bayesian Neural Networks, probabilistic convolutions<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty awareness in AI systems used in safety-critical domains such as medical diagnosis and autonomous mobility. The authors propose a photonic Bayesian machine that exploits the inherent randomness found in chaotic light sources to perform uncertainty reasoning within Bayesian Neural Networks. This analog photonic processor integrates a high-speed 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, facilitating probabilistic convolutions with an impressive speed of 37.5 picoseconds per convolution. The system is demonstrated on a practical task involving the simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images, showing effective differentiation between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. By harnessing photonics, the approach removes the traditional bottleneck caused by pseudo-random number generation in digital architectures, significantly reducing sampling costs that typically hinder probabilistic model efficiency. The novel photonic Bayesian machine thereby enables high-throughput, trustworthy AI systems capable of reliable uncertainty quantification essential for real-world critical applications. <div>

The analog processor features a 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, enabling probabilistic convolutions processing within 37.5 ps per convolution. We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.

<div> Keywords: phylogenetics, neural networks, distance functions, molecular evolution, hierarchical clustering<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses the challenge of inferring phylogenetic relationships among organisms, a key task in biology. Traditional methods like distance-based hierarchical clustering, although initially successful, have been largely replaced by Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods grounded in complex molecular evolution models. The authors propose minimal neural network architectures designed to approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions efficiently. These networks capture essential properties needed to learn distances under various molecular evolutionary models. Unlike heavy model-based inference or recent model-free convolutional and transformer networks, these architectures maintain a small computational footprint and scale effectively with increasing numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The networks demonstrate strong generalization ability, performing well on diverse data. When trained on suitable datasets, these learned distance functions achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art phylogenetic inference methods, offering a computationally efficient alternative without sacrificing performance. <div>

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

<div> Fairness, Explainability, Shapley values, Healthcare, Bias mitigation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The study investigates the relationship between model fairness improvements and explainability in trustworthy machine learning for healthcare applications.<br /><br />2. It highlights that while improving fairness often affects predictive performance, the impact on explanations, especially Shapley-based feature importance rankings, remains underexplored.<br /><br />3. Using three datasets related to pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk, the authors assess changes in feature rankings after applying fairness constraints.<br /><br />4.

Results show that increasing fairness across racial subgroups can significantly shift feature importance rankings, sometimes differently for each subgroup, indicating potential challenges for clinical trust.<br /><br />6. The findings emphasize the necessity to consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability together during model evaluation rather than treating them separately. <div>

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Membership queries, testable learning, distribution-specific learning, refutation, statistical queries<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper investigates the impact of membership queries (MQ) in the testable learning model introduced by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2023), a model where the learning algorithm must produce a near-optimal hypothesis if the data distribution satisfies certain properties. 2. It shows that membership queries do not reduce the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond what is achievable by sample-only distribution-specific learning algorithms. 3. The authors provide a general reduction from sample-based refutation of Boolean concept classes—frameworks previously studied by Vadhan (2017) and Klivans and Li (2018)—to testable learning with queries (TL-Q), establishing strong lower bounds on the efficiency gains possible from MQ in this setting. 4. Consequently, for any concept class and distribution family, no TL-Q algorithm using m samples can be super-polynomially faster than the best m-sample PAC learner. 5. Additionally, the paper defines a class of “statistical” MQ algorithms common in distribution-specific learning, such as those based on influence estimation and subcube-conditional statistical queries, and demonstrates that TL-Q algorithms in this class correspond to efficient statistical query refutation and learning algorithms. This leads to the conclusion that known SQ dimension lower bounds imply many efficient MQ learners cannot be testable. <div>
arXiv:2512.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

<title>Training Dynamics of Learning 3D-Rotational Equivariance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Data augmentation, equivariance error, 3D-rotation, molecular tasks, loss landscape<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses how quickly and effectively models trained with data augmentation learn to respect symmetries, specifically 3D rotational equivariance. The authors derive a principled measure of equivariance error for convex losses, quantifying the portion of total loss due to imperfect symmetry learning. Their empirical investigation focuses on high-dimensional molecular tasks, including flow matching, force field prediction, and voxel denoising. Results reveal that models reduce equivariance error rapidly to less than or equal to 2% of held-out loss within 1,000 to 10,000 training steps, consistent across various model and dataset sizes. This rapid convergence occurs because learning 3D rotational equivariance presents an easier optimization problem with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape compared to the main prediction task. Interestingly, the penalty in loss for models not enforcing equivariance remains small throughout training, which means non-equivariant models may achieve lower test losses per GPU-hour unless the efficiency gap associated with equivariant learning is reduced. Additionally, the paper investigates both experimentally and theoretically how relative equivariance error relates to learning gradients and model parameters, offering insights into the interplay between symmetry learning and optimization dynamics. <div>
arXiv:2512.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

<div> Boltzmann machines, simulated bifurcation, Langevin SB, inverse temperature estimation, sampler-adaptive learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces an innovative approach to improve the training efficiency and versatility of Boltzmann machines (BMs), energy-based generative models that traditionally require costly training methods. The authors propose a novel sampling method named Langevin Simulated Bifurcation (LSB), inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization technique, simulated bifurcation (SB). LSB allows for parallelized sampling that matches the accuracy of conventional MCMC methods but operates more efficiently. Unlike previous approaches limited to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), this method applies to BMs with general couplings, significantly broadening applicability. However, LSB alone cannot control the inverse temperature of the sampled Boltzmann distribution, which is critical for stable learning and performance. To resolve this, the authors develop a method called conditional expectation matching (CEM), which efficiently estimates the inverse temperature during training. By integrating LSB with CEM, they create a combined framework named sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL facilitates efficient learning with enhanced model expressiveness beyond RBMs, advancing the practical usability of BMs. This work paves the way for more effective energy-based generative modeling by addressing sampling parallelization and temperature control challenges. <div>
arXiv:2512.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-augmented models, online learning, concept drift, memory replay, non-stationary environments<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of streaming supervised learning in non-stationary environments, specifically focusing on handling concept drift where data distributions change over time.<br />2. It introduces Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), an extension of stochastic gradient descent that incorporates a small buffer of past examples to improve online classification.<br />3. RAM-OL retrieves nearest neighbours of the current input from the buffer in the hidden representation space and jointly updates the model using both the current input and retrieved examples.<br />4. Two replay variants are proposed: a naive replay which simply reuses neighbours, and a gated replay that applies constraints such as a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting to balance rapid adaptation with robustness against outdated data.<br />5. Theoretically, the approach is analyzed under a bounded drift model, showing how retrieval can lower adaptation costs and improve regret bounds when patterns recur.<br />6. Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets (electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delays) demonstrates that RAM-OL significantly improves accuracy and reduces variance in strongly drifting data, with the gated variant performing comparably to baseline methods in noisier data.<br />7. The study concludes that retrieval-augmented memory is an effective, practical, and robust method for online learning under concept drift scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

<div> Keywords: MBTA, subway usage prediction, delay modeling, machine learning, feature importance<br /><br />Summary:<br />The paper focuses on predicting subway usage and delays within the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transit system in Boston. It evaluates 10 statistical and machine learning models to predict next-day gated station entries, a proxy for subway ridership, incorporating factors such as day of the week, season, pressure, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. For delay prediction, an additional model—a self-exciting point process model—is introduced to extend the evaluation to 11 models, highlighting a novel application of point-process frameworks for MBTA delay analysis. The research experiments with selective feature inclusion to identify the importance of different factors in model performance. Results show that including day of week or season data significantly improves the predictive accuracy over models without them. Contrarily, adding weather data (pressure, wind speed, temperature, precipitation) generally degrades performance, likely due to overfitting issues. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used to assess model accuracy. The study provides insights into which variables are most relevant for forecasting transit usage and delays, suggesting that temporal features such as day and season are more impactful than weather variables for predictive models in the MBTA context. <div>
arXiv:2512.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

<div> speculative decoding, long-context generation, large language models, verification bottleneck, SpecPV  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require efficient long-context generation to support complex tasks such as code generation, deep reasoning, and understanding long documents. Speculative decoding is an effective acceleration technique that uses a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes multiple candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, as context length increases, the verification step becomes the main bottleneck slowing down generation. To address this, the authors propose SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding method that speeds up verification by utilizing partial key-value (KV) states for fast checking and periodically performs full verification to correct accumulated errors. The approach balances efficiency and accuracy through this hybrid verification strategy. SpecPV is evaluated on multiple long-context benchmarks with different models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecPV can achieve up to a 6x speedup in decoding compared to standard autoregressive decoding while only incurring minor performance degradation, significantly improving generation efficiency for long-context LLM applications. <div>

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

<div> Keywords: Federated Reinforcement Learning, offline learning, vote mechanism, advantage-weighted regression, policy improvement<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) integrates federated learning with offline reinforcement learning, targeting distributed training from decentralized datasets. Existing offline FRL methods often suffer significant performance degradation when handling mixed-quality data collected by policies of varying quality across clients. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a novel vote-based offline FRL framework named FOVA, which utilizes a vote mechanism to accurately identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation. This strategy mitigates the adverse impact of low-quality behaviors resulting from heterogeneous local policies. Additionally, FOVA incorporates advantage-weighted regression (AWR) to establish consistent local and global training objectives, greatly improving both training efficiency and stability. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the policy learned by FOVA guarantees strict improvement over the behavioral policy used to collect data. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks validate the effectiveness of FOVA, showing it achieves substantial performance gains compared to existing baseline methods in offline FRL scenarios with mixed-quality data. Overall, the work advances offline FRL by enabling more robust and efficient policy learning in federated settings with heterogeneous client datasets. <div>
arXiv:2512.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

<div> Gradient-based optimization, POMDP, GPOMDP algorithm, policy gradient, average reward<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores both theoretical foundations and experimental validations of gradient-based methods aimed at directly optimizing policy performance in controlled partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors introduce GPOMDP, an algorithm inspired by the REINFORCE approach, designed to estimate an approximation of the gradient of the average reward with respect to parameters of a stochastic policy. GPOMDP's main advantages are threefold: it needs only a single sample path from the underlying Markov chain, it employs a single free parameter \(\beta \in [0,1)\) that intuitively balances bias and variance, and it functions without any explicit knowledge of the system's true states. The paper provides rigorous proofs of convergence for the GPOMDP algorithm, ensuring its theoretical soundness. Moreover, the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP are integrated into a conjugate-gradient optimization procedure that effectively searches for local maxima of the average reward function, facilitating improved policy performance in environments governed by POMDP dynamics. This work bridges the gap between practical algorithm design and theoretical guarantees within reinforcement learning under partial observability. <div>
arXiv:2512.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $\beta\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

<div> Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, continuous-time, stochastic differential equation, optimized certainty equivalent, q-learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) in continuous-time settings, where the environment dynamics are described by controllable stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The research focuses on optimizing policies according to a general nonlinear risk-sensitive criterion defined as a functional of cumulative rewards. A key theoretical result demonstrates that for risk functionals expressed as optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs), the optimal policy can be represented as a Markovian policy when applied to an augmented version of the original environment. Building on this theoretical insight, the authors introduce CT-RS-q, a novel risk-sensitive variant of q-learning designed for continuous-time problems. The algorithm leverages a new martingale characterization technique to handle the continuous-time and risk-sensitive nature of the task. To validate the proposed method, a simulation study is conducted involving a dynamic portfolio selection problem, showcasing the algorithm’s practical effectiveness. The results illustrate that CT-RS-q successfully learns risk-sensitive policies and can manage the trade-off between return and risk inherent in financial decision-making contexts. Overall, the paper contributes both theoretical foundations and an actionable algorithm for continuous-time risk-aware reinforcement learning applications. <div>

We also propose \textit{CT-RS-q}, a risk-sensitive q-learning algorithm based on a novel martingale characterization approach. Finally, we run a simulation study on a dynamic portfolio selection problem and illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

<div> Transformers, Sparsity, Local Similarity, SPLS, ESACT<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Transformers, despite their superior performance in many domains, suffer from high computational costs that limit their efficient deployment on hardware. Sparsity is a promising approach to reduce this overhead, yet existing accelerators mainly exploit intra-row sparsity in attention mechanisms, neglecting inter-row sparsity or relying on expensive global similarity computations which reduce acceleration benefits. Most current methods also limit sparsity application to only a few transformer components. This work analyzes attention distribution and computation flow, revealing that leveraging local similarity can enable efficient end-to-end sparse acceleration with minimal computational overhead. Based on this insight, the authors propose ESACT, an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive transformers. ESACT utilizes the SplS (Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity) mechanism that employs HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity before QK generation, enabling efficient sparsity across all transformer components. To facilitate hardware implementation, the design introduces three architectural innovations. Experimental evaluations on 26 benchmarks show that SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss. ESACT achieves an energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W end-to-end and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95× and 2.26× compared with state-of-the-art attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

<div> Keywords: on-street parking, traffic congestion, multi-agent reinforcement learning, dynamic configuration, spatio-temporal correlations  

<br /><br />Summary:  
With urban traffic congestion worsening due to increased travel demand, on-street parking further restricts road space and impedes traffic flow. This paper investigates minimizing the negative effects of on-street parking by dynamically configuring parking spaces using vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity. The problem is formulated as an optimization task addressed through a data-driven approach. The proposed solution is a scalable two-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. At the lane level, agents decide optimal parking configurations using a novel Deep Q-learning model that incorporates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and graph attention networks (GANs) to effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies. At the higher block level, agents oversee lane agents’ actions to ensure adequate parking availability within blocks. The framework is evaluated through comprehensive experiments in the SUMO traffic simulator, using both synthetic scenarios and real-world data from Melbourne, Australia. Results demonstrate a substantial reduction in average vehicle travel time loss by up to 47%, while only minimally increasing walking distances to parking spaces. This approach shows promise in balancing efficient traffic flow with parking availability through adaptive, data-driven strategies leveraging advanced reinforcement learning techniques. <div>

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

<div> data pruning, synthetic data, neural scaling, spectral tail exponent, data curation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the effects of various data-centric strategies utilized in training large-scale neural models, including data pruning, synthetic data generation, distillation, RLHF, and difficulty-based sampling. It highlights that while some methods reliably improve efficiency and performance, synthetic data often increases dataset size without enhancing model capabilities. The authors formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and analyze its impact through the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Their first main result demonstrates that static pruning corresponds to a bounded operator, which cannot alter the spectral tail exponent, thereby limiting improvements to finite regions and not affecting asymptotic neural scaling. The second key result concerns time-dependent data curation, where an idealized oracle that dynamically tracks and re-normalizes spectral residuals in the data could provably accelerate learning by modifying the tail behavior of the spectrum. However, practical implementations can only approximate this ideal process. Overall, the work provides a theoretical framework linking data manipulation methods to their influence on neural scaling laws and learning dynamics, explaining why some data curation strategies yield limited gains while suggesting paths toward more effective adaptive sampling techniques. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

<div> Keywords: Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning, Offline RL, Dynamics Alignment, Value Alignment, Data Filtering  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning, where an agent trained with limited target domain data and abundant source domain data must overcome dynamics discrepancies between domains. The authors identify that previous methods focus exclusively on dynamics alignment—selecting samples that match the target domain’s environment dynamics—but neglect value alignment, which involves choosing source samples of high-value relevance to the target tasks. They demonstrate through theoretical analysis that both dynamics and value alignment are critical for narrowing the sub-optimality gap when transferring policies. Motivated by this insight, the paper introduces DVDF (Dynamics- and Value-aligned Data Filtering), a method that filters and selects source domain data exhibiting both alignments to improve policy learning. The authors construct various dynamics shift scenarios, such as changes in kinematics and morphology, to rigorously evaluate their approach. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks and datasets show that DVDF consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly in low-data regimes where only 5,000 target domain transitions are available. Overall, DVDF demonstrates superior generalization and robustness in cross-domain offline RL by jointly addressing both key aspects of alignment, paving the way for more effective knowledge transfer in reinforcement learning. <div>
arXiv:2512.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

<title>When Refusals Fail: Unstable Safety Mechanisms in Long-Context LLM Agents</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, long context window, agentic setup, task performance, safety issues<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article investigates the behavior of large language model (LLM) agents when operating over very long context windows, particularly focusing on agentic setups which combine tool usage and extended context. Unlike prior work that mainly evaluated LLMs on long-context prompts, this study highlights how the length, type, and placement of context can cause inconsistent and unexpected changes in both task performance and safety-related refusals to carry out harmful requests. The authors observe that models with context windows ranging from 1 million to 2 million tokens already show significant performance degradation at around 100,000 tokens, with task accuracy dropping by more than 50% in both benign and harmful scenarios. Furthermore, refusal rates behave unpredictably depending on the model: for instance, GPT-4.1-nano’s refusal rate increased from roughly 5% to 40% at 200,000 tokens, whereas Grok 4 Fast’s refusal rate decreased sharply from 80% to 10%. These findings reveal critical safety concerns when LLM agents are employed in long-horizon, multi-step tasks with extensive context, suggesting that current safety evaluation metrics and paradigms may be inadequate. The work calls for rethinking how LLM agent capabilities and safety are assessed in long-context and agentic environments. <div>
arXiv:2512.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

<div> Keywords: Urban rainfall monitoring, Commercial Microwave Links, TabGRU, Transformer, Bidirectional GRU  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of high-resolution urban rainfall monitoring, essential for resilient smart cities amid increasing urbanization and extreme weather events. It introduces a novel hybrid deep learning model called TabGRU, combining the Transformer architecture with a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to capture both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in Commercial Microwave Link (CML) data. The model incorporates learnable positional embeddings and an attention pooling mechanism to enhance dynamic feature extraction and generalization. Validation was conducted on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden, comprising data from 12 sub-links and two rain gauges over a test period involving around 10 rainfall events. The TabGRU model outperformed traditional physics-based models and other deep learning baselines, achieving high coefficients of determination (R² of 0.91 at Torp and 0.96 at Barl). Notably, TabGRU effectively mitigated the overestimation issues seen in physics-based models during peak rainfall. The results demonstrate that the proposed TabGRU can robustly and accurately monitor urban rainfall using CML data, overcoming limitations of existing methods under tested conditions. <div>

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

<div> Keywords: offline reinforcement learning, cross-domain, dynamics shifts, robustness, Bellman operator<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of limited data coverage in single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging cross-domain offline RL, which uses additional data from domains with shifted dynamics. <br />2. Current approaches mainly focus on robustness during training against dynamics shifts but overlook robustness at test time when the policy encounters dynamics perturbations in real-world deployments. <br />3. Empirical analysis reveals that policies trained via cross-domain offline RL can be fragile during evaluation, especially when target domain data is scarce. <br />4. To improve both train-time and test-time robustness, the authors introduce the Robust Cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which remains conservative regarding out-of-distribution dynamics transitions and enhances resilience to dynamics perturbations. <br />5. To mitigate potential value estimation errors introduced by RCB, the framework incorporates a dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, culminating in the Dual-ROBust Cross-domain Offline RL (DROCO) algorithm. <br />6. Extensive experiments across diverse dynamics shift scenarios demonstrate that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and significantly boosts robustness against dynamics perturbations. <div>
arXiv:2512.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

<div> Keywords: wireless VR, federated learning, caching strategy, decentralized learning, quality of experience<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of delivering high-quality, real-time wireless VR video by proposing a decentralized multi-task fair federated learning (DMTFL) approach tailored for caching users’ fields of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs). Traditional federated learning methods tend to bias toward certain users and fail to adapt to the statistical heterogeneity among different users and BSs because they rely on a single global model. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL personalizes caching models for each BS to optimize content delivery while ensuring fairness and efficiency. The models learned at each BS are optimized to perform well under any target distribution, which is theoretically supported by guarantees derived from Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss function. The caching and prefetching strategies tailored for each BS help reduce latency and improve the user quality of experience by anticipating VR users’ FOV preferences. Simulations based on realistic VR head-tracking datasets demonstrate the superiority of the DMTFL algorithm over baseline approaches, showing improved fairness and performance in wireless VR content delivery. This work paves the way for scalable, personalized, and efficient wireless VR streaming systems. <div>
arXiv:2512.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

<title>In-Context Distillation with Self-Consistency Cascades: A Simple, Training-Free Way to Reduce LLM Agent Costs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: in-context distillation, LLM agents, cost reduction, self-consistency cascades, multi-step reasoning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the high inference costs associated with deploying large language model (LLM) agents at scale, which hinder rapid prototyping and experimentation. The authors propose a novel method called in-context distillation that adapts knowledge distillation to an in-context learning framework by retrieving relevant teacher demonstrations dynamically during each agent step and providing them as examples to a lower-cost student model. This enables the student to imitate the teacher’s behavior on-the-fly without expensive fine-tuning or manual prompt engineering. They further integrate this method with self-consistency cascades, an approach that adaptively determines when to trust the student model’s outputs, balancing cost-efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results on the ALFWorld benchmark, which involves multi-step embodied reasoning, demonstrate that the approach achieves teacher-level accuracy at 2.5× lower inference cost, reducing per-episode cost from \$0.059 to \$0.024 and yielding significant cumulative savings at deployment scale. On the AppWorld benchmark, focused on multi-step API workflows, their method shifts the Pareto frontier by cutting costs in half without sacrificing performance. Overall, this approach materially lowers operational costs and preserves rapid experimentation capabilities, making advanced LLM agent systems more economically viable for wider adoption. <div>
arXiv:2512.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Previous work resolved this issue by reparameterizing model parameters using tensor networks. However, optimizing feature hyperparameters remained reliant on costly standard cross-validation methods. The authors propose the Feature Learning (FL) model, which represents tensor-product features through a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD), enabling joint optimization of feature hyperparameters and model parameters. Leveraging the CPD structure allows the use of an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for efficient training. Experiments on real-world datasets of varying dimensionality and size demonstrate that the FL model consistently trains 3 to 5 times faster compared to traditional approaches while achieving comparable prediction accuracy. The FL model thus offers a scalable and practical solution for hyperparameter optimization in kernel-based learning with tensor-product features. <div>

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

The paper introduces CUDA-L2, a novel system that leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels automatically.<br /><br />2. CUDA-L2 uses CUDA kernel execution speed as the RL reward to explore and optimize across 1,000 different kernel configurations, enabling it to systematically improve performance beyond existing solutions.<br /><br />3.

In an offline mode, where kernels execute in rapid succession, CUDA-L2 delivers an average performance boost of +22.0% over torch.matmul, +19.2% over cuBLAS (optimal layouts), +16.8% over cuBLASLt-heuristic, and +11.4% over cuBLASLt-AutoTuning.<br /><br />5. Under server mode conditions simulating real-time inference with random kernel execution intervals, these improvements are even more pronounced, rising to +28.7%, +26.0%, +22.4%, and +15.9% respectively.<br /><br />6.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

<title>GoRL: An Algorithm-Agnostic Framework for Online Reinforcement Learning with Generative Policies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, multimodal policies, generative models, latent policy, continuous control<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses a core challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) where policies easy to optimize often lack the expressiveness needed for complex control tasks due to their unimodal nature, exemplified by Gaussian policies. It introduces GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that decouples the optimization process from action generation by using a tractable latent policy combined with a conditional generative decoder. This design allows stable optimization of the latent policy on one timescale while the decoder, which synthesizes actions, evolves separately to enhance policy expressiveness without requiring tractable action likelihoods. The two-timescale update mechanism stabilizes training, preventing instability caused by propagating noisy gradients through deep generative chains, a challenge in prior generative policy approaches. Empirical evaluations on various continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that GoRL consistently outperforms standard Gaussian policies and recent generative policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, GoRL achieves a normalized return above 870, exceeding the strongest baseline by more than a factor of three. Overall, the work establishes that separating optimization from generation offers a practical and effective strategy to develop RL policies that are both stable to train and capable of modeling complex, multimodal action distributions. <div>
arXiv:2512.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

<div> Heat transfer, semiconductor devices, physics-informed neural networks, Transformer architecture, interface thermal modeling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of modeling heat transfer in semiconductor devices where a finite chip layer interfaces with a semi-infinite substrate having significantly different thermophysical properties, resulting in steep temperature gradients at the interface. Traditional numerical methods require fine discretization to capture these gradients, which is computationally intensive. Similarly, conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) struggle with unstable convergence and physical inconsistencies near the interface. To overcome these issues, the authors propose HeatTransFormer, a novel physics-guided Transformer architecture tailored for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The model incorporates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation function mimicking analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism that enables bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These innovations allow HeatTransFormer to accurately resolve steep interfacial gradients, maintain physical consistency, and achieve stable convergence where PINNs often fail. The framework is validated on configurations involving a finite chip layer coupled with a semi-infinite substrate, successfully predicting coherent temperature fields across the interface. Furthermore, when combined with a physics-constrained inverse modeling approach, HeatTransFormer can simultaneously identify three unknown thermal properties using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer models offer a unified and effective solution for both forward simulation and inverse parameter identification in complex thermal systems dominated by interfacial phenomena. <div>
arXiv:2512.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

<div> Vision-Language Navigation, Large Vision-Language Models, Visual Prompt, Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, Navigation Success Rate<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This work presents SeeNav-Agent, a novel framework designed to enhance Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents that utilize Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which typically suffer from perception, reasoning, and planning errors. To tackle perception hallucinations and improve spatial awareness, the framework introduces a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique applied in the input space. For improving planning and post-training efficiency, a step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method called Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO) is developed. SRGPO defines verifiable process rewards and performs efficient advantage estimation by randomly grouping navigation steps, providing dense reward signals to boost reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark show that integrating the zero-shot VP module with GPT-4.1 reaches a navigation success rate of 86.7%, outperforming current top LVLMs by approximately 20 percentage points. Additionally, after SRGPO-based post-training, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model achieves a success rate of 72.3%, 5.6 percentage points higher than the best existing LVLM. Compared to other RFT algorithms like GRPO and GiGPO, SRGPO demonstrates superior training stability, faster convergence, and better generalization, indicating its effectiveness in advancing VLN performance. <div>

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

<div> Keywords: flow-based generative models, likelihood evaluation, neural function evaluations, continuous normalizing flows, distillation

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the challenge of efficient log-likelihood evaluation in generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, which currently require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) per likelihood computation.  
2. Existing distillation techniques have reduced sampling steps significantly but have compromised likelihood tractability by either abandoning likelihood computation or still demanding costly integration over full trajectories.  
3. The authors introduce Fast Flow Joint Distillation (F2D2), a novel framework that drastically cuts down the NFEs needed for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by about two orders of magnitude.  
4. F2D2 leverages the insight that in continuous normalizing flows, sampling and likelihood ODEs share a velocity field, enabling joint distillation of both sampling trajectories and cumulative divergence using a single unified model with an added divergence prediction head.  
5. The method is modular, compatible with existing few-step flow-based sampling models, preserves high sample quality, and resolves a key computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As a practical application, the paper proposes a lightweight self-guidance method that allows a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024-step teacher model with only one extra backward NFE. <div>

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

<div> Multi-view learning, kernel methods, LS-SVM, adaptive weighting, privacy-preserving<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted least squares support vector machine designed for multi-view learning scenarios. Multi-view learning integrates various representations of the same data instances to enhance overall model performance. Existing kernel-based methods often rely on fusion techniques that lack explicit enforcement of collaboration types across different views or employ co-regularization methods that limit comprehensive global collaboration. AW-LSSVM addresses these shortcomings by promoting complementary learning via an iterative global coupling mechanism. This approach enables each view to concentrate on difficult samples identified by other views from previous iterations, dynamically adjusting the view weights to better capture the complexities in the data. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that AW-LSSVM consistently outperforms prevailing kernel-based multi-view learning methods. Additionally, the method retains the isolation of raw features for each view, which inherently supports privacy-preserving applications by avoiding direct data sharing or fusion of sensitive raw data. The proposed adaptive weighted LS-SVM framework thus balances improved predictive accuracy with privacy considerations, making it well-suited for real-world scenarios involving diverse data representations and privacy constraints. <div>

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration.

<div> Keywords: continual unlearning, generative models, machine unlearning, generative distillation, data privacy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses the challenge of machine unlearning (MU) within large-scale visual generative models, especially under real-world conditions where deletion requests happen sequentially, termed continual unlearning (CUL). Existing MU methods applied naïvely in this continual setting cause significant issues, including stability crises, retention collapse, unwanted damage to related concepts, and loss of generative quality. To tackle these problems, the authors propose a novel continual unlearning framework based on generative distillation, which treats each unlearning step as a multi-objective teacher-student distillation task. This approach draws on continual learning principles to preserve model integrity while accommodating multiple sequential deletion requests. Experimental evaluation on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrates that their method effectively forgets targeted concepts with high fidelity without notable negative impact on the retention of other concepts or the overall image quality. Their framework notably outperforms existing baselines in terms of both unlearning accuracy and stability. The study offers a practical pathway for industries to responsibly deploy and maintain large generative models while complying with evolving data privacy regulations such as GDPR’s “Right to be Forgotten.” This work thus represents an important step towards scalable and stable continual unlearning in generative AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2512.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

arXiv:2512.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

arXiv:2512.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

<title>From Navigation to Refinement: Revealing the Two-Stage Nature of Flow-based Diffusion Models through Oracle Velocity</title>

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

<title>A Comparative Study on How Data Normalization Affects Zero-Shot Generalization in Time Series Foundation Models</title>

arXiv:2512.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

<title>GraphMatch: Fusing Language and Graph Representations in a Dynamic Two-Sided Work Marketplace</title>

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

<title>Adaptive Decentralized Federated Learning for Robust Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

<title>FAIRY2I: Universal Extremely-Low Bit QAT framework via Widely-Linear Representation and Phase-Aware Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

<title>Hypothesis Testing for Generalized Thurstone Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

<title>Fast Gaussian Process Approximations for Autocorrelated Data</title>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

arXiv:2512.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.

Abstract: Covid has made online teaching and learning acceptable and students, faculty, and industry professionals are all comfortable with this mode. This comfort can be leveraged to offer an online multi-institutional research-level course in an area where individual institutions may not have the requisite faculty to teach and/or research students to enroll. If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled "AI in Software Engineering" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience. We believe this collaborative teaching approach can be used for offering research level courses in any applied area of computer science by institutions who are small and find it difficult to offer research level courses on their own.

Abstract: Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.

Abstract: Automatic transcription of stuttered speech remains a challenge, even for modern end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks. Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.

Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive tumor, urgently requiring novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a dry-to-wet framework combining generative modeling and experimental validation to optimize peptides targeting ATP5A, a potential peptide-binding protein for GBM. Our framework introduces the first lead-conditioned generative model, which focuses exploration on geometrically relevant regions around lead peptides and mitigates the combinatorial complexity of de novo methods. Specifically, we propose POTFlow, a \underline{P}rior and \underline{O}ptimal \underline{T}ransport-based \underline{Flow}-matching model for peptide optimization. POTFlow employs secondary structure information (e.g., helix, sheet, loop) as geometric constraints, which are further refined by optimal transport to produce shorter flow paths. With this design, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with five popular approaches. When applied to GBM, our method generates peptides that selectively inhibit cell viability and significantly prolong survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. As the first lead peptide-conditioned flow matching model, POTFlow holds strong potential as a generalizable framework for therapeutic peptide design.

<title>Characterizing Continuous and Discrete Hybrid Latent Spaces for Structural Connectomes</title>

Abstract: Structural connectomes are detailed graphs that map how different brain regions are physically connected, offering critical insight into aging, cognition, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, these connectomes are high-dimensional and densely interconnected, which makes them difficult to interpret and analyze at scale. While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components. We analyze a large dataset of 5,761 connectomes from six Alzheimer's disease studies with ten acquisition protocols. Each connectome represents a single scan from a unique subject (3579 females, 2182 males), aged 22 to 102, with 4338 cognitively normal, 809 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 614 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each connectome contains 121 brain regions defined by the BrainCOLOR atlas. We train our hybrid VAE in an unsupervised way and characterize what each latent component captures. We find that the discrete space is particularly effective at capturing subtle site-related differences, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.65 with site labels, significantly outperforming PCA and a standard VAE followed by clustering (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the hybrid latent space can disentangle distinct sources of variability in connectomes in an unsupervised manner, offering potential for large-scale connectome analysis.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is the analysis and selection of stock trading systems that combine different models with data of different nature, such as financial and microeconomic information. Specifically, based on previous work by the authors and applying advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our objective is to formulate trading algorithms for the stock market with empirically tested statistical advantages, thus improving results published in the literature. Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees. We also discuss how the prediction performance of such a hybrid approach can be boosted by selecting the technical variables.

<title>From 'What-is' to 'What-if' in Human-Factor Analysis: A Post-Occupancy Evaluation Case</title>

Abstract: Human-factor analysis typically employs correlation analysis and significance testing to identify relationships between variables. However, these descriptive ('what-is') methods, while effective for identifying associations, are often insufficient for answering causal ('what-if') questions. Their application in such contexts often overlooks confounding and colliding variables, potentially leading to bias and suboptimal or incorrect decisions.
  We advocate for explicitly distinguishing descriptive from interventional questions in human-factor analysis, and applying causal inference frameworks specifically to these problems to prevent methodological mismatches. This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses. The systematic distinction between causally associated and independent variables, combined with intervention prioritization capabilities, offers broad applicability to complex human-centric systems, for example, in building science or ergonomics, where understanding intervention effects is critical for optimization and decision-making.

Abstract: Frequency control in power systems is critical to maintaining stability and preventing blackouts. Traditional methods like meta-heuristic algorithms and machine learning face limitations in real-time applicability and scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach using a pure variational quantum circuit (VQC) for real-time secondary frequency control in diesel generators. Unlike hybrid classical-quantum models, the proposed VQC operates independently during execution, eliminating latency from classical-quantum data exchange. The VQC is trained via supervised learning to map historical frequency deviations to optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters using a pre-computed lookup table. Simulations demonstrate that the VQC achieves high prediction accuracy (over 90%) with sufficient quantum measurement shots and generalizes well across diverse test events. The quantum-optimized PI parameters significantly improve transient response, reducing frequency fluctuations and settling time.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve feature extraction and classification tasks in high-dimensional data domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.

<title>The 4/$\delta$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee</title>

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\delta$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\delta > 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/\delta$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

<title>From Betti Numbers to Persistence Diagrams: A Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Topological Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: Persistence diagrams serve as a core tool in topological data analysis, playing a crucial role in pathological monitoring, drug discovery, and materials design. However, existing quantum topological algorithms, such as the LGZ algorithm, can only efficiently compute summary statistics like Betti numbers, failing to provide persistence diagram information that tracks the lifecycle of individual topological features, severely limiting their practical value. This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from "quantum computation of Betti numbers" to "quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams." The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of "classical precision guiding quantum efficiency." This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis.

Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

Abstract: Timely assessment of current conditions is essential especially for small, open economies such as Singapore, where external shocks transmit rapidly to domestic activity. We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

Abstract: Metric graphs are structures obtained by associating edges in a standard graph with segments of the real line and gluing these segments at the vertices of the graph. The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Abstract: The financial market is a mission-critical playground for AI agents due to its temporal dynamics and low signal-to-noise ratio. Building an effective algorithmic trading system may require a professional team to develop and test over the years. In this paper, we propose an orchestration framework for financial agents, which aims to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. We map each component of the traditional algorithmic trading system to agents, including planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent. We present two in-house trading examples. For the stock trading task (hourly data from 04/2024 to 12/2024), our approach achieved a return of $20.42\%$, a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, and a maximum drawdown of $-3.59\%$, while the S&amp;P 500 index yielded a return of $15.97\%$. For the BTC trading task (minute data from 27/07/2025 to 13/08/2025), our approach achieved a return of $8.39\%$, a Sharpe ratio of $0.38$, and a maximum drawdown of $-2.80\%$, whereas the BTC price increased by $3.80\%$.

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying closed-loop contraction in nonlinear control systems whose controller and contraction metric are both parameterized by neural networks. By leveraging interval analysis and interval bound propagation, we derive a tractable and scalable sufficient condition for closed-loop contractivity that reduces to checking that the dominant eigenvalue of a symmetric Metzler matrix is nonpositive. We combine this sufficient condition with a domain partitioning strategy to integrate this sufficient condition into training. The proposed approach is validated on an inverted pendulum system, demonstrating the ability to learn neural network controllers and contraction metrics that provably satisfy the contraction condition.

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

<title>Adversarial Robustness of Traffic Classification under Resource Constraints: Input Structure Matters</title>

Abstract: Traffic classification (TC) plays a critical role in cybersecurity, particularly in IoT and embedded contexts, where inspection must often occur locally under tight hardware constraints. We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting protein fitness with minimal experimental data is a persistent challenge in protein engineering. We introduce PRIMO (PRotein In-context Mutation Oracle), a transformer-based framework that leverages in-context learning and test-time training to adapt rapidly to new proteins and assays without large task-specific datasets. By encoding sequence information, auxiliary zero-shot predictions, and sparse experimental labels from many assays as a unified token set in a pre-training masked-language modeling paradigm, PRIMO learns to prioritize promising variants through a preference-based loss function. Across diverse protein families and properties-including both substitution and indel mutations-PRIMO outperforms zero-shot and fully supervised baselines. This work underscores the power of combining large-scale pre-training with efficient test-time adaptation to tackle challenging protein design tasks where data collection is expensive and label availability is limited.

Abstract: Selecting an effective docking algorithm is highly context-dependent, and no single method performs reliably across structural, chemical, or protocol regimes. We introduce MolAS, a lightweight algorithm selection system that predicts per-algorithm performance from pretrained protein-ligand embeddings using attentional pooling and a shallow residual decoder. With only hundreds to a few thousand labelled complexes, MolAS achieves up to 15% absolute improvement over the single-best solver (SBS) and closes 17-66% of the Virtual Best Solver (VBS)-SBS gap across five diverse docking benchmarks. Analyses of reliability, embedding geometry, and solver-selection patterns show that MolAS succeeds when the oracle landscape exhibits low entropy and separable solver behaviour, but collapses under protocol-induced hierarchy shifts. These findings indicate that the main barrier to robust docking AS is not representational capacity but instability in solver rankings across pose-generation regimes, positioning MolAS as both a practical in-domain selector and a diagnostic tool for assessing when AS is feasible.

Abstract: The stochastic Polyak step size (SPS) has proven to be a promising choice for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), delivering competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on smooth convex and non-convex optimization problems, including deep neural network training. However, extensions of this approach to non-smooth settings remain in their early stages, often relying on interpolation assumptions or requiring knowledge of the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. Comprehensive experiments on convex benchmarks and deep neural networks corroborate our theory: the proposed step size accelerates convergence, reduces variance, and consistently outperforms existing adaptive baselines. Finally, in the context of deep neural network training, our method demonstrates robust performance by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Bridge On-chain and Off-chain Transparency in Stablecoins</title>

Abstract: Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC aspire to peg stability by coupling issuance controls with reserve attestations. In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds the promise of enhancing machine learning modeling in terms of both complexity and accuracy. A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

Abstract: Discovering which tables in large, heterogeneous repositories can be joined and by what transformations is a central challenge in data integration and data discovery. Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Causal analyses derived from observational data underpin high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, public policy, and economics. Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.

Abstract: Inverse problems arise across scientific and engineering domains, where the goal is to infer hidden parameters or physical fields from indirect and noisy observations. Classical approaches, such as variational regularization and Bayesian inference, provide well established theoretical foundations for handling ill posedness. However, these methods often become computationally restrictive in high dimensional settings or when the forward model is governed by complex physics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) has advanced significantly, enabling models to generate vocals with accurate pitch and consistent style. As these capabilities improve, the need for reliable evaluation and optimization becomes increasingly critical. However, current methods like reward systems often rely on single numerical scores, struggle to capture various dimensions such as phrasing or expressiveness, and require costly annotations, limiting interpretability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose a generative feedback (i.e., reward model) framework that provides multi-dimensional language and audio feedback for SVS assessment. Our approach leverages an audio-language model to generate text and audio critiques-covering aspects such as melody, content, and auditory quality. The model is fine-tuned on a hybrid dataset combining human music reactions and synthetic critiques from a MLLMs, enhancing diversity and linguistic richness. Quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and training strategy, demonstrating that the framework produces musically accurate and interpretable evaluations suitable for guiding generative model improvement.

Abstract: To address the scalability limitations of Gaussian process (GP) regression, several approximation techniques have been proposed. One such method is based on tensor networks, which utilizes an exponential number of basis functions without incurring exponential computational cost. However, extending this model to a fully probabilistic formulation introduces several design challenges. In particular, for tensor train (TT) models, it is unclear which TT-core should be treated in a Bayesian manner. We introduce a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine that applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core and employs variational inference (VI) for precision hyperparameters. Experiments show that core selection is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure, and that VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on an inverse dynamics problem.

Abstract: The computational demands of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are immense and constantly growing. While training costs usually capture public attention, inference demands are also contributing in significant computational, energy and environmental footprints. Sparsity stands out as a critical mechanism for drastically reducing these resource demands. However, its potential remains largely untapped and is not yet fully incorporated in production AI systems. To bridge this gap, this work provides the necessary knowledge and insights for performance engineers keen to get involved in deep learning inference optimization. In particular, in this work we: a) discuss the various forms of sparsity that can be utilized in DNN inference, b) explain how the original dense computations translate to sparse kernels, c) provide an extensive bibliographic review of the state-of-the-art in the implementation of these kernels for CPUs and GPUs, d) discuss the availability of sparse datasets in support of sparsity-related research and development, e) explore the current software tools and frameworks that provide robust sparsity support, and f) present evaluation results of different implementations of the key SpMM and SDDMM kernels on CPU and GPU platforms. Ultimately, this paper aims to serve as a resource for performance engineers seeking to develop and deploy highly efficient sparse deep learning models in productions.

<title>Zero-Shot Instruction Following in RL via Structured LTL Representations</title>

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

<title>Hear What Matters! Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation</title>

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified study of four distinct modeling approaches for classifying dysarthria severity in the Speech Analysis for Neurodegenerative Diseases (SAND) challenge. All models tackle the same five class classification task using a common dataset of speech recordings. We investigate: (1) a ViT-OF method leveraging a Vision Transformer on spectrogram images, (2) a 1D-CNN approach using eight 1-D CNN's with majority-vote fusion, (3) a BiLSTM-OF approach using nine BiLSTM models with majority vote fusion, and (4) a Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble that combines glottal and formant features through a two stage learning framework. Each method is described, and their performances on a validation set of 53 speakers are compared. Results show that while the feature-engineered XGBoost ensemble achieves the highest macro-F1 (0.86), the deep learning models (ViT, CNN, BiLSTM) attain competitive F1-scores (0.70) and offer complementary insights into the problem.

Abstract: We propose the first return time distribution (FRTD) of a random walk as an interpretable and mathematically grounded node embedding. The FRTD assigns a probability mass function to each node, allowing us to define a distance between any pair of nodes using standard metrics for discrete distributions. We present several arguments to motivate the FRTD embedding. First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features. Together these results demonstrate the FRTD as a simple and mathematically principled embedding for complex networks.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

<title>VLM-Pruner: Buffering for Spatial Sparsity in an Efficient VLM Centrifugal Token Pruning Paradigm</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02700</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Abstract: Born-rule generative modeling, a central task in quantum machine learning, seeks to learn probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled by measuring complex quantum states. One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees.

<title>DF-Mamba: Deformable State Space Modeling for 3D Hand Pose Estimation in Interactions</title>

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $\nu_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\Theta$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\kappa$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\kappa > 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

Abstract: Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is among the most popular and powerful approaches for self-supervised representation learning, where the goal is to map semantically similar samples close together while separating dissimilar ones in the latent space. Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

<title>Are Detectors Fair to Indian IP-AIGC? A Cross-Generator Study</title>

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

<title>Leveraging generative adversarial networks with spatially adaptive denormalization for multivariate stochastic seismic data inversion</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

<title>Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

Abstract: While machine learning has enabled the rapid prediction of inorganic materials with novel properties, the challenge of determining how to synthesize these materials remains largely unsolved. Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.

<title>Flexible Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation with Transformers</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.

Abstract: Robust decoding and classification of brain patterns measured with electroencephalography (EEG) remains a major challenge for real-world (i.e. outside scientific lab and medical facilities) brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to well documented inter- and intra-participant variability. Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique.

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

Abstract: This article investigates the modeling and control of Lagrangian systems involving non-conservative forces using a hybrid method that does not require acceleration calculations. It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.

Abstract: Traditional randomized A/B experiments assign arms with uniform random (UR) probability, such as 50/50 assignment to two versions of a website to discover whether one version engages users more. To more quickly and automatically use data to benefit users, multi-armed bandit algorithms such as Thompson Sampling (TS) have been advocated. While TS is interpretable and incorporates the randomization key to statistical inference, it can cause biased estimates and increase false positives and false negatives in detecting differences in arm means. We introduce a more Statistically Sensitive algorithm, TS-PostDiff (Posterior Probability of Small Difference), that mixes TS with traditional UR by using an additional adaptive step, where the probability of using UR (vs TS) is proportional to the posterior probability that the difference in arms is small. This allows an experimenter to define what counts as a small difference, below which a traditional UR experiment can obtain informative data for statistical inference at low cost, and above which using more TS to maximize user benefits is key. We evaluate TS-PostDiff against UR, TS, and two other TS variants designed to improve statistical inference. We consider results for the common two-armed experiment across a range of settings inspired by real-world applications. Our results provide insight into when and why TS-PostDiff or alternative approaches provide better tradeoffs between benefiting users (reward) and statistical inference (false positive rate and power). TS-PostDiff's adaptivity helps efficiently reduce false positives and increase statistical power when differences are small, while increasing reward more when differences are large. The work highlights important considerations for future Statistically Sensitive algorithm development that balances reward and statistical analysis in adaptive experimentation.

Abstract: We provide universality results that quantify how data augmentation affects the variance and limiting distribution of estimates through simple surrogates, and analyze several specific models in detail. The results confirm some observations made in machine learning practice, but also lead to unexpected findings: Data augmentation may increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of augmentations, and dimension. As our main theoretical tool, we develop an adaptation of Lindeberg's technique for block dependence. The resulting universality regime may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian.

Abstract: Neural Networks can be effectively compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and compute demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Our findings present a promising alternative to avoiding retraining.

Abstract: We study the approximation-theoretic implications of mixture-of-experts architectures for operator learning, where the complexity of a single large neural operator is distributed across many small neural operators (NOs), and each input is routed to exactly one NO via a decision tree. We analyze how this tree-based routing and expert decomposition affect approximation power, sample complexity, and stability. Our main result is a distributed universal approximation theorem for mixture of neural operators (MoNOs): any Lipschitz nonlinear operator between $L^2([0,1]^d)$ spaces can be uniformly approximated over the Sobolev unit ball to arbitrary accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ by an MoNO, where each expert NO has a depth, width, and rank scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Although the number of experts may grow with accuracy, each NO remains small, enough to fit within active memory of standard hardware for reasonable accuracy levels. Our analysis also yields new quantitative approximation rates for classical NOs approximating uniformly continuous nonlinear operators uniformly on compact subsets of $L^2([0,1]^d)$.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is crucial for smart cities and intelligent transportation initiatives, where deep learning has made significant progress in modeling complex spatio-temporal patterns in recent years. However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.

Abstract: The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $\alpha_i > 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $\alpha_i/(\alpha_i + \alpha_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has become a promising approach for both manipulation and locomotion. Diffusion models are now widely used to train large, generalized policies that predict controls or trajectories, leveraging their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, this generality comes at the cost of larger model sizes and slower inference, an acute limitation for robotic tasks requiring high control frequencies. Moreover, Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular trajectory-generation approach, suffers from a trade-off between performance and action horizon: fewer diffusion queries lead to larger trajectory chunks, which in turn accumulate tracking errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce WARPD (World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion), a method that generates closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) directly, instead of open-loop trajectories. By learning behavioral distributions in parameter space rather than trajectory space, WARPD offers two major advantages: (1) extended action horizons with robustness to perturbations, while maintaining high task performance, and (2) significantly reduced inference costs. Empirically, WARPD outperforms DP in long-horizon and perturbed environments, and achieves multitask performance on par with DP while requiring only ~ 1/45th of the inference-time FLOPs per step.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM) training pipelines require the assembly of internet-scale databases full of text data from a variety of sources (e.g., web, academic, and publishers). Preprocessing these datasets via deduplication -- detecting and eliminating additional instances of the same content -- is a major focus for assembling and curating training datasets for LLMs. Unrestrained, duplicates in the training dataset increase training costs and lead to undesirable properties such as memorization in trained models or cheating on evaluation. Unfortunately, contemporary approaches to document-level deduplication are either unreliable at accurately identifying duplicate documents or extremely expensive in terms of both runtime and memory. We propose LSHBloom, an extension to MinhashLSH, which replaces the expensive LSHIndex with lightweight Bloom filters. LSHBloom demonstrates the same state-of-the-art deduplication performance as MinhashLSH, with only a marginal increase in false positives (near zero in our experiments), while boasting competitive runtime (12$\times$ faster than MinhashLSH on peS2o) and, crucially, using 18$\times$ less disk space than MinhashLSH (as measured on peS2o). Based on extrapolation, we show that this advantage in space and runtime remains even at the extreme scale of several billion documents. LSHBloom allows practitioners to access the deduplication quality of MinHashLSH at scales that are normally only tractable for less sophisticated, heuristic solutions. As a result, LSHBloom promises to enable scaling high-quality document deduplication to internet-scale text datasets.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning aims at addressing the challenges of non-IID data in collaborative model training. However, existing methods struggle to balance personalization and generalization, often oversimplifying client similarities or relying too heavily on global models. In this paper, we propose FedSub, a novel approach that introduces class-aware model updates based on data prototypes and model subnetworks fusion to enhance personalization. Prototypes serve as compact representations of client data for each class, clustered on the server to capture label-specific similarities among the clients. Meanwhile, model subnetworks encapsulate the most relevant components to process each class and they are then fused on the server based on the identified clusters to generate fine-grained, class-specific, and highly personalized model updates for each client. Experimental results in three real-world scenarios with high data heterogeneity in human activity recognition and mobile health applications demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSub with respect to state-of-the-art methods to achieve fast convergence and high classification performance.

<title>Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark performance across families</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens, but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance accurately and offers insights into scaling behaviors for complex downstream tasks, increased test-time compute, and compute-optimal scaling of skills.

<title>CSI-BERT2: A BERT-inspired Framework for Efficient CSI Prediction and Classification in Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, built on CSI-BERT, which adapts BERT to capture the complex relationships among CSI sequences through a bidirectional self-attention mechanism. We introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. To further enhance the representation capacity of CSI data, we modify the structure of the original CSI-BERT. We introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based temporal embedding module to mitigate temporal information loss problem inherent in the original Transformer. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CSI-BERT2 .

Abstract: How can we effectively remove or ''unlearn'' undesirable information, such as specific features or the influence of individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a unified mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both data point unlearning and feature unlearning. For data point unlearning, we introduce the $\textit{Marginal Unlearning Principle}$, an auditable and provable framework inspired by memory suppression studies in neuroscience. Moreover, we provide formal information-theoretic unlearning definition based on the proposed principle, named marginal unlearning, and provable guarantees on sufficiency and necessity of marginal unlearning to the existing approximate unlearning definitions. We then show the proposed framework provide natural solution to the marginal unlearning problems. For feature unlearning, the framework applies to deep learning with arbitrary training objectives. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications. From a mathematical perspective, we provide an unified analytic solution to the optimal feature unlearning problem with a variety of information-theoretic training objectives. Our theoretical analysis reveals intriguing connections between machine unlearning, information theory, optimal transport, and extremal sigma algebras. Numerical simulations support our theoretical finding.

Abstract: Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders, decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while incurring lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

<title>Aligning Compound AI Systems via System-level DPO</title>

Abstract: Compound AI systems, comprising multiple interacting components such as LLMs, foundation models, and external tools, have demonstrated remarkable improvements compared to single models in various tasks. To ensure their effective deployment in real-world applications, aligning these systems with human preferences is crucial. However, aligning the compound system via policy optimization, unlike the alignment of a single model, is challenging for two main reasons: (i) non-differentiable interactions between components make end-to-end gradient-based optimization method inapplicable, and (ii) system-level preferences cannot be directly transformed into component-level preferences. To address these challenges, we first formulate compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), explicitly modeling both component interactions and the associated data flows. Building on this formulation, we introduce $\textbf{SysDPO}$, a framework that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable joint system-level alignment. We propose two variants, SysDPO-Direct and SysDPO-Sampling, tailored for scenarios depending on whether we construct a system-specific preference dataset. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across two applications: the joint alignment of a language model and a diffusion model, and the joint alignment of an LLM collaboration system.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to interpret neural networks by identifying meaningful concepts from their representations. However, do SAEs truly uncover all concepts a model relies on, or are they inherently biased toward certain kinds of concepts? We introduce a unified framework that recasts SAEs as solutions to a bilevel optimization problem, revealing a fundamental challenge: each SAE imposes structural assumptions about how concepts are encoded in model representations, which in turn shapes what it can and cannot detect. This means different SAEs are not interchangeable -- switching architectures can expose entirely new concepts or obscure existing ones. To systematically probe this effect, we evaluate SAEs across a spectrum of settings: from controlled toy models that isolate key variables, to semi-synthetic experiments on real model activations and finally to large-scale, naturalistic datasets. Across this progression, we examine two fundamental properties that real-world concepts often exhibit: heterogeneity in intrinsic dimensionality (some concepts are inherently low-dimensional, others are not) and nonlinear separability. We show that SAEs fail to recover concepts when these properties are ignored, and we design a new SAE that explicitly incorporates both, enabling the discovery of previously hidden concepts and reinforcing our theoretical insights. Our findings challenge the idea of a universal SAE and underscores the need for architecture-specific choices in model interpretability. Overall, we argue an SAE does not just reveal concepts -- it determines what can be seen at all.

Abstract: This work proposes a mathematically founded mixed precision accumulation strategy for the inference of neural networks. Our strategy is based on a new componentwise forward error analysis that explains the propagation of errors in the forward pass of neural networks. Specifically, our analysis shows that the error in each component of the output of a linear layer is proportional to the condition number of the inner product between the weights and the input, multiplied by the condition number of the activation function. These condition numbers can vary widely from one component to the other, thus creating a significant opportunity to introduce mixed precision: each component should be accumulated in a precision inversely proportional to the product of these condition numbers. We propose a numerical algorithm that exploits this observation: it first computes all components in low precision, uses this output to estimate the condition numbers, and recomputes in higher precision only the components associated with large condition numbers. We test our algorithm on various networks and datasets and confirm experimentally that it can significantly improve the cost--accuracy tradeoff compared with uniform precision accumulation baselines.

Abstract: Monitoring maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is crucial for preventing adverse outcomes. While tests such as ultrasound scans offer high accuracy, they can be costly and inconvenient. Telehealth and more accessible body shape information provide pregnant women with a convenient way to monitor their health. This study explores the potential of 3D body scan data, captured during the 18-24 gestational weeks, to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes and estimate clinical parameters. We developed a novel algorithm with two parallel streams which are used for extract body shape features: one for supervised learning to extract sequential abdominal circumference information, and another for unsupervised learning to extract global shape descriptors, alongside a branch for demographic data.
  Our results indicate that 3D body shape can assist in predicting preterm labor, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension (GH), and in estimating fetal weight. Compared to other machine learning models, our algorithm achieved the best performance, with prediction accuracies exceeding 88% and fetal weight estimation accuracy of 76.74% within a 10% error margin, outperforming conventional anthropometric methods by 22.22%.

Abstract: Activation functions play a critical role in deep neural networks by shaping gradient flow, optimization stability, and generalization. While ReLU remains widely used due to its simplicity, it suffers from gradient sparsity and dead-neuron issues and offers no adaptivity to input statistics. Smooth alternatives such as Swish and GELU improve gradient propagation but still apply a fixed transformation regardless of the activation distribution. In this paper, we propose VeLU, a Variance-enhanced Learning Unit that introduces variance-aware and distributionally aligned nonlinearity through a principled combination of ArcTan-ArcSin transformations, adaptive scaling, and Wasserstein-2 regularization (Optimal Transport). This design enables VeLU to modulate its response based on local activation variance, mitigate internal covariate shift at the activation level, and improve training stability without adding learnable parameters or architectural overhead. Extensive experiments across six deep neural networks show that VeLU outperforms ReLU, ReLU6, Swish, and GELU on 12 vision benchmarks. The implementation of VeLU is publicly available in GitHub.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels, i.e., normalized probability distributions) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive accuracy. Enhanced ERA resolves the fundamental instability of conventional temperature-based aggregation, ensuring robust control and high performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and a log-likelihood loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the log-likelihood loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.

Abstract: To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The target of secant losses is the same as that of diffusion models, or the diffusion model itself, leading to great training stability. By fine-tuning or distillation, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on multimodal datasets with up to 15 modalities demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of additional modalities for selected samples compared with methods relying solely on unimodal information, entropy-based guidance, or random selection. We showcase the real-world relevance and scalability of our method by demonstrating its ability to effectively guide the costly acquisition of proteomics data for disease prediction in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank (UKBB). Our work provides an effective approach for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling more effective use of resources in constrained settings.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method validated across NLP and CV domains. However, LoRA faces an inherent low-rank bottleneck: narrowing its performance gap with full finetuning requires increasing the rank of its parameter matrix, resulting in significant parameter overhead. Recent linear LoRA variants have attempted to enhance expressiveness by introducing additional linear mappings; however, their composition remains inherently linear and fails to fundamentally improve LoRA's representational capacity. To address this limitation, we propose AuroRA, which incorporates an Adaptive Nonlinear Layer (ANL) between two linear projectors to capture fixed and learnable nonlinearities. This combination forms an MLP-like structure with a compressed rank, enabling flexible and precise approximation of diverse target functions while theoretically guaranteeing lower approximation errors and bounded gradients. Extensive experiments on 22 datasets and 6 pretrained models demonstrate that AuroRA: (I) not only matches or surpasses full fine-tuning performance with only 6.18% ~ 25% of LoRA's parameters but also (II) outperforms competitive PEFT methods by up to 10.88% in both NLP and CV tasks, and (III) exhibits robust performance across various rank configurations.

Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.

Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses can vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.

Abstract: Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in such settings is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph and especially consider the averaging over nearest neighbors with secure summation and individual node-wise views. Our main contribution is a an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes across different scenarios. In case the gossip averaging happens via secure summation, we show that the R\'enyi DP parameter growth is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

<title>On the Closed-Form of Flow Matching: Generalization Does Not Arise from Target Stochasticity</title>

Abstract: Modern deep generative models can now produce high-quality synthetic samples that are often indistinguishable from real training data. A growing body of research aims to understand why recent methods, such as diffusion and flow matching techniques, generalize so effectively. Among the proposed explanations are the inductive biases of deep learning architectures and the stochastic nature of the conditional flow matching loss. In this work, we rule out the noisy nature of the loss as a key factor driving generalization in flow matching. First, we empirically show that in high-dimensional settings, the stochastic and closed-form versions of the flow matching loss yield nearly equivalent losses. Then, using state-of-the-art flow matching models on standard image datasets, we demonstrate that both variants achieve comparable statistical performance, with the surprising observation that using the closed-form can even improve performance.

<title>Revisiting Clustering of Neural Bandits: Selective Reinitialization for Mitigating Loss of Plasticity</title>

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations. However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments (e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Adaptation is the holy grail of intelligence, but even the best AI models lack the adaptability of toddlers. In spite of great progress, little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can learn to adapt as fast as humans and animals. Here, we cast adaptation as `correction' of old posteriors and show that a wide-variety of existing adaptation methods follow this very principle, including those used for continual learning, federated learning, unlearning, and model merging. In all these settings, more accurate posteriors often lead to smaller corrections and can enable faster adaptation. Posterior correction is derived by using the dual representation of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023), where the interference between the old representation and new information is quantified by using the natural-gradient mismatch. We present many examples demonstrating how machines can learn to adapt quickly by using posterior correction.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific domains.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet computational methods often struggle to balance performance with biological interpretability. Embedded topic models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning. However, these models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse, where topics semantically collapse towards each other, resulting in redundant topics and incomplete capture of biological variation. Furthermore, the rise of single-cell foundation models creates opportunities to harness external biological knowledge for guiding model embeddings. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding and interpretation for scRNA-seq analysis. Through embedding clustering regularization method, each topic is constrained to be the center of a separately aggregated gene cluster, enabling it to capture unique biological information. Across 20 scRNA-seq datasets, scE2TM achieves superior clustering performance compared with seven state-of-the-art methods. A comprehensive interpretability benchmark further shows that scE2TM-learned topics exhibit higher diversity and stronger consistency with underlying biological pathways. Modeling interferon-stimulated PBMCs, scE2TM simulates topic perturbations that drive control cells toward stimulated-like transcriptional states, faithfully mirroring experimental interferon responses. In melanoma, scE2TM identifies malignant-specific topics and extrapolates them to unseen patient data, revealing gene programs associated with patient survival.

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each individual sample. This provides insights into the decision-making process for each case, which makes DFS especially significant in settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions. However, existing DFS methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in real-life scenarios. DFS also introduces new own sources of uncertainty compared to the static setting, which is also not considered in the existing literature. In this paper, we formalize the additional sources of uncertainty in DFS, and give formulas to estimate them. We also propose novel approach by leveraging a rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach against established and state-of-the-art greedy and reinforcement learning methods, which are mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rulebased system.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new information-theoretic perspective on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for parameter estimation with i.i.d. data, and show that MIL can outperform single-instance learners in low-signal regimes. Prior work [Nachman and Thaler, 2021] argued that single-instance methods are often sufficient, but this conclusion presumes enough single-instance signal to train near-optimal classifiers. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art single-instance models can fail to reach optimal classifier performance in challenging low-signal regimes, whereas MIL can mitigate this sub-optimality. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In experiments, we observe that under specific modeling and weak signal conditions, pooling instances can increase the effective Fisher information compared to single-instance approaches.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

SSP problems form an important class of problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

Abstract: The ubiquity of missing data in urban intelligence systems, attributable to adverse environmental conditions and equipment failures, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of downstream applications, notably in the realms of traffic forecasting and energy consumption prediction.
  Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist.
  Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks.
  Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem.
  Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models.
  In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model.
  The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning.
  Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However, providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature. Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to (experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial, highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40\% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce BoreaRL, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard gradient-descent based preference-conditioned approaches fail, while a naive site selection approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.

<title>Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking</title>

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li}_2$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize, and at the same time, the backpropagated gradient $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation independently. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layers. The code is available at https://github.com/yuandong-tian/understanding/tree/main/ssl/real-dataset/cogo.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training, effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities. However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose LLM-NAS: an LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed LLM-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, LLM-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited. Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present **Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD)**, a novel algorithm that grounds skill discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere, clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a simulated SMPL humanoid with $359$-D observations and $69$-D actions, RGSD successfully imitates skills such as walking, running, punching, and sidestepping, while also discover variations of these behaviors. In downstream locomotion tasks, RGSD leverages the discovered skills to faithfully satisfy user-specified style commands and outperforms imitation-learning baselines, which often fail to maintain the commanded style. Overall, our results suggest that lightweight reference-grounding offers a practical path to discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

<title>Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers</title>

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee (RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our RCC-MLDE approach on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains. However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and significantly speed up computations (20,000x), from hundreds of milliseconds to hours. This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

Abstract: Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.

Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.

<title>DiCaP: Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling for Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data in multi-label learning (MLL) by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%.

<title>On SkipGram Word Embedding Models with Negative Sampling: Unified Framework and Impact of Noise Distributions</title>

Abstract: SkipGram word embedding models with negative sampling, or SGN in short, is an elegant family of word embedding models. In this paper, we formulate a framework for word embedding, referred to as Word-Context Classification (WCC), that generalizes SGN to a wide family of models. The framework, which uses some ``noise examples'', is justified through theoretical analysis. The impact of noise distribution on the learning of the WCC embedding models is studied experimentally, suggesting that the best noise distribution is, in fact, the data distribution, in terms of both the embedding performance and the speed of convergence during training. Along our way, we discover several novel embedding models that outperform existing WCC models.

<title>Predicting Human Perceptions of Robot Performance During Navigation Tasks</title>

Abstract: Understanding human perceptions of robot performance is crucial for designing socially intelligent robots that can adapt to human expectations. Current approaches often rely on surveys, which can disrupt ongoing human-robot interactions. As an alternative, we explore predicting people's perceptions of robot performance using non-verbal behavioral cues and machine learning techniques. We contribute the SEAN TOGETHER Dataset consisting of observations of an interaction between a person and a mobile robot in Virtual Reality, together with perceptions of robot performance provided by users on a 5-point scale. We then analyze how well humans and supervised learning techniques can predict perceived robot performance based on different observation types (like facial expression and spatial behavior features). Our results suggest that facial expressions alone provide useful information, but in the navigation scenarios that we considered, reasoning about spatial features in context is critical for the prediction task. Also, supervised learning techniques outperformed humans' predictions in most cases. Further, when predicting robot performance as a binary classification task on unseen users' data, the F1-Score of machine learning models more than doubled that of predictions on a 5-point scale. This suggested good generalization capabilities, particularly in identifying performance directionality over exact ratings. Based on these findings, we conducted a real-world demonstration where a mobile robot uses a machine learning model to predict how a human who follows it perceives it. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for implementing these supervised learning models in real-world navigation. Our work paves the path to automatically enhancing robot behavior based on observations of users and inferences about their perceptions of a robot.

<title>ContourDiff: Unpaired Medical Image Translation with Structural Consistency</title>

Abstract: Accurately translating medical images between different modalities, such as Computed Tomography (CT) to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), has numerous downstream clinical and machine learning applications. While several methods have been proposed to achieve this, they often prioritize perceptual quality with respect to output domain features over preserving anatomical fidelity. However, maintaining anatomy during translation is essential for many tasks, e.g., when leveraging masks from the input domain to develop a segmentation model with images translated to the output domain. To address these challenges, we propose ContourDiff with Spatially Coherent Guided Diffusion (SCGD), a novel framework that leverages domain-invariant anatomical contour representations of images. These representations are simple to extract from images, yet form precise spatial constraints on their anatomical content. We introduce a diffusion model that converts contour representations of images from arbitrary input domains into images in the output domain of interest. By applying the contour as a constraint at every diffusion sampling step, we ensure the preservation of anatomical content. We evaluate our method on challenging lumbar spine and hip-and-thigh CT-to-MRI translation tasks, via (1) the performance of segmentation models trained on translated images applied to real MRIs, and (2) the foreground FID and KID of translated images with respect to real MRIs. Our method outperforms other unpaired image translation methods by a significant margin across almost all metrics and scenarios. Moreover, it achieves this without the need to access any input domain information during training and we further verify its zero-shot capability, showing that a model trained on one anatomical region can be directly applied to unseen regions without retraining (GitHub: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/ContourDiff).

<title>Lockpicking LLMs: A Logit-Based Jailbreak Using Token-level Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing, but they remain susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that exploit their capabilities to generate unintended and potentially harmful content. Existing token-level jailbreaking techniques, while effective, face scalability and efficiency challenges, especially as models undergo frequent updates and incorporate advanced defensive measures. In this paper, we introduce JailMine, an innovative token-level manipulation approach that addresses these limitations effectively. JailMine employs an automated "mining" process to elicit malicious responses from LLMs by strategically selecting affirmative outputs and iteratively reducing the likelihood of rejection. Through rigorous testing across multiple well-known LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate JailMine's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a significant average reduction of 86% in time consumed while maintaining high success rates averaging 95%, even in the face of evolving defensive strategies. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to assess and mitigate the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks, underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and proactive measures to enhance the security and reliability of these powerful language models.

Abstract: Change point detection (CPD) and anomaly detection (AD) are essential techniques in various fields to identify abrupt changes or abnormal data instances. However, existing methods are often constrained to univariate data, face scalability challenges with large datasets due to computational demands, and experience reduced performance with high-dimensional or intricate data, as well as hidden anomalies. Furthermore, they often lack interpretability and adaptability to domain-specific knowledge, which limits their versatility across different fields. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based CPD/AD method called Probabilistic Predictive Coding (PPC) that jointly learns to encode sequential data to low-dimensional latent space representations and to predict the subsequent data representations as well as the corresponding prediction uncertainties. The model parameters are optimized with maximum likelihood estimation by comparing these predictions with the true encodings. At the time of application, the true and predicted encodings are used to determine the probability of conformance, an interpretable and meaningful anomaly score. Furthermore, our approach has linear time complexity, scalability issues are prevented, and the method can easily be adjusted to a wide range of data types and intricate applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed method across synthetic time series experiments, image data, and real-world magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data.

<title>Hidden in Plain Text: Emergence &amp; Mitigation of Steganographic Collusion in LLMs</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of frontier model agents promises significant societal advances but also raises concerns about systemic risks arising from unsafe interactions. Collusion to the disadvantage of others has been identified as a central form of undesirable agent cooperation. The use of information hiding (steganography) in agent communications could render such collusion practically undetectable. This underscores the need for investigations into the possibility of such behaviours emerging and the robustness corresponding countermeasures. To investigate this problem we design two approaches -- a gradient-based reinforcement learning (GBRL) method and an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) method -- for reliably eliciting sophisticated LLM-generated linguistic text steganography.
  We demonstrate, for the first time, that unintended steganographic collusion in LLMs can arise due to mispecified reward incentives during training. Additionally, we find that standard mitigations -- both passive oversight of model outputs and active mitigation through communication paraphrasing -- are not fully effective at preventing this steganographic communication. Our findings imply that (i) emergence of steganographic collusion is a plausible concern that should be monitored and researched, and (ii) preventing emergence may require innovation in mitigation techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses an online convex optimization problem where the cost function at each step depends on a history of past decisions (i.e., memory), and the decision maker has access to limited predictions of future cost values within a finite window. The goal is to design an algorithm that minimizes the dynamic regret against the optimal sequence of decisions in hindsight. To this end, we propose a novel predictive algorithm and establish strong theoretical guarantees for its performance. We show that the algorithm's dynamic regret decays exponentially with the length of the prediction window. Our algorithm comprises two general subroutines of independent interest. The first subroutine solves online convex optimization with memory and bandit feedback, achieving a $\sqrt{TV_T}$-dynamic regret, where $V_T$ measures the variation of the optimal decision sequence. The second is a zeroth-order method that attains a linear convergence rate for general convex optimization, matching the best achievable rate of first-order methods. The key to our algorithm is a novel truncated Gaussian smoothing technique when querying the decision points to obtain the predictions. We validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image classification inspired by complex nonlinear biological visual processing, whereby classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equipped with learnable higher-order convolutions. Our model incorporates a Volterra-like expansion of the convolution operator, capturing multiplicative interactions akin to those observed in early and advanced stages of biological visual processing. We evaluated this approach on synthetic datasets by measuring sensitivity to testing higher-order correlations and performance in standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenette). Our architecture outperforms traditional CNN baselines, and achieves optimal performance with expansions up to 3rd/4th order, aligning remarkably well with the distribution of pixel intensities in natural images. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we validate this alignment by isolating the contributions of specific image statistics to model performance, demonstrating how different orders of convolution process distinct aspects of visual information. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis reveals distinct geometries across network layers, indicating qualitatively different modes of visual information processing. Our work bridges neuroscience and deep learning, offering a path towards more effective, biologically inspired computer vision models. It provides insights into visual information processing and lays the groundwork for neural networks that better capture complex visual patterns, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decentralized projection-free optimization, extending projection-free methods to a broader class of upper-linearizable functions. Our approach leverages decentralized optimization techniques with the flexibility of upper-linearizable function frameworks, effectively generalizing traditional DR-submodular function optimization. We obtain the regret of $O(T^{1-\theta/2})$ with communication complexity of $O(T^{\theta})$ and number of linear optimization oracle calls of $O(T^{2\theta})$ for decentralized upper-linearizable function optimization, for any $0\le \theta \le 1$. This approach allows for the first results for monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints and non-monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints. Further, the above results for first order feedback are extended to zeroth order, semi-bandit, and bandit feedback.

Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the VMC optimization part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through VMC, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.

Abstract: We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $\alpha = M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha$-$\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.

Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled the automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving high realism, precise dance-music synchronization, diverse motion expression, and physical plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a generative masked text-to-motion model as a distribution prior to learn a probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals, including music, genre, and pose, into high-quality dance motion sequences. Our framework also supports semantic motion editing, such as motion inpainting and body part modification. Specifically, we introduce a multi-tower masked motion model that integrates a text-conditioned masked motion backbone with two parallel, modality-specific branches: a music-guidance tower and a pose-guidance tower. The model is trained using synchronized and progressive masked training, which allows effective infusion of the pretrained text-to-motion prior into the dance synthesis process while enabling each guidance branch to optimize independently through its own loss function, mitigating gradient interference. During inference, we introduce classifier-free logits guidance and pose-guided token optimization to strengthen the influence of music, genre, and pose signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art in dance generation, significantly advancing both the quality and editability over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference, while also removing the flexibility to reduce to simpler systems. We introduce MAS-ZERO, the first self-evolved, inference-time framework for automatic MAS design. MAS-ZERO employs meta-level design to iteratively design, critique, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic problem decomposition and agent composition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness, and reduction to simpler systems when appropriate. Experiments across reasoning (math and graduate-level QA), coding, and agentic (search-based) benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM backbones of varying sizes, demonstrate that MAS-ZERO outperforms strong manual and automatic MAS baselines. It achieves substantial average accuracy improvements of up to 16.69% on reasoning, 16.66% on coding, and 5.45% on agentic tasks, while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a given vulnerability), and Patch (patching a given vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a given vulnerability. We evaluate 10 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI with o3-high and o4-mini, and custom agents with o3-high, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, Qwen3 235B A22B, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek-R1. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping to \$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,152), Custom Agent: Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). Codex CLI: o3-high, Codex CLI: o4-mini, and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90%, 90%, and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 47.5%, 32.5%, and 57.5% respectively; while the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 17.5-67.5% and Patch scores of 25-60%.

Abstract: Selecting artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), from multiple candidates requires accurate performance estimation. This is ideally achieved through empirical evaluations involving abundant real-world data. However, such evaluations are costly and impractical at scale. To address this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised prediction-powered inference (PPI) to correct for the bias of autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only real-world data. In this paper, we propose R-AutoEval+, a novel framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of R-AutoEval+ is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to conventional methods when the autoevaluator is insufficiently accurate. Experiments on the use of LLMs-as-judges for the optimization of quantization settings for the weights of an LLM, for prompt design in LLMs, and for test-time reasoning budget allocation in LLMs confirm the reliability and efficiency of R-AutoEval+.

Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions, enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

<title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

<title>HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Distortion-Free LLM Watermarks for Low-Entropy Next-Token Predictions</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -- such as coding -- where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality. These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the "health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.

arXiv:2507.14270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both optimization-efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and training efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark designed to probe how well LLMs handle instruction following, visual reasoning, and tasks requiring tight visual textual alignment. The dataset is built around programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, each paired with a carefully constructed, multi step analytical question that depends solely on what can be inferred from the image itself. Responses are formatted in structured outputs such as JSON or YAML, enabling consistent and fine grained evaluation of both reasoning processes and adherence to output specifications. The benchmark further introduces a taxonomy of reasoning operations ranging from comparison and trend identification to ranking, aggregation, proportional estimation, and anomaly detection to support a comprehensive assessment of model capabilities. Taken together, GRAFT provides a unified and scalable framework for evaluating multimodal LLMs on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, offering a more rigorous standard for future benchmarking efforts.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining have achieved strong performance on in-distribution (ID) data but often generalize poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We investigate this behavior for lung cancer segmentation using an encoder-decoder model. Our encoder is a Swin Transformer pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans spanning cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, and the decoder was randomly initialized. This model was evaluated on an independent ID test set and four OOD scenarios, including chest CT cohorts (pulmonary embolism and negative COVID-19) and abdomen CT cohorts (kidney cancers and non-cancerous pancreas). OOD detection was performed at the scan level using RF-Deep, a random forest classifier applied to contextual tumor-anchored feature representations. We evaluated 920 3D CTs (172,650 images) and observed that RF-Deep achieved FPR95 values of 18.26% and 27.66% on the chest CT cohorts, and near-perfect detection (less than 0.1% FPR95) on the abdomen CT cohorts, consistently outperforming established OOD methods. These results demonstrate that our RF-Deep classifier provides a simple, lightweight, and effective approach for enhancing the reliability of segmentation models in clinical deployment.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models. The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects.

Abstract: We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing response given an observed covariate. Experiments illustrate the performance of kNNSampler. The code for kNNSampler is made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).

arXiv:2509.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem: data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data, retroactively respecting `robots.txt` exclusions and filtering for non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on 15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive web platform for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This web system connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. It unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. This web platform also shows model reasoning, helping users see why errors occur and what cues the models rely on. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, run models, then iterate. We ask a question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments to inform earlier study design? For example, a team building an AI assistant for a certain task can estimate whether expected performance is around 50 or closer to 80, evidence that supports whether to proceed to a pilot study, how to scope it, and how to allocate resources. We study text-only performance forecasting, where a model predicts a score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a leakage free test split using papers published after the knowledge cutoff of the evaluated models. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve moderate prediction performance with well calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high confidence thresholds. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT5 with built in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

arXiv:2509.25045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods either focus on input-oriented feature extraction, such as supervised probes and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), or on output distribution inspection, such as logit-oriented approaches. A full understanding of LLM vector spaces, however, requires integrating both perspectives, something existing approaches struggle with due to constraints on latent feature definitions. We introduce the Hyperdimensional Probe, a hybrid supervised probe that combines symbolic representations with neural probing. Leveraging Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) and hypervector algebra, it unifies prior methods: the top-down interpretability of supervised probes, SAE's sparsity-driven proxy space, and output-oriented logit investigation. This allows deeper input-focused feature extraction while supporting output-oriented investigation. Our experiments show that our method consistently extracts meaningful concepts across LLMs, embedding sizes, and setups, uncovering concept-driven patterns in analogy-oriented inference and QA-focused text generation. By supporting joint input-output analysis, this work advances semantic understanding of neural representations while unifying the complementary perspectives of prior methods.

Abstract: Human infants acquire language and action gradually through development, achieving strong generalization from minimal experience, whereas large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study investigates this question through robot simulation experiments in which agents learn to perform actions associated with imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via curiosity-driven self-exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal several key findings: i) Generalization improves markedly as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity combined with motor noise yields substantially better learning than exploration without curiosity. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions develop earlier than more complex actions that depend on them. v) When exception-handling rules were introduced -- where certain imperative sentences required executing inconsistent actions -- the robots successfully acquired these exceptions through exploration and displayed a U-shaped performance curve characteristic of representational redescription in child language learning. Together, these results suggest that curiosity-driven exploration and active inference provide a powerful account of how intrinsic motivation and hierarchical sensorimotor learning can jointly support scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in both humans and artificial agents.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.

Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42 countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially, their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity, as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.

Abstract: Causal discovery from i.i.d. observational data is known to be generally ill-posed. We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a structural causal model, and additional data from only two environments that sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary information.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar is crucial for underwater monitoring where optical sensing fails, but its use is limited by low uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) affecting up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

<title>Front-door Reducibility: Reducing ADMGs to the Standard Front-door Setting via a Graphical Criterion</title>

Abstract: Front-door adjustment gives a simple closed-form identification formula under the classical front-door criterion, but its applicability is often viewed as narrow. By contrast, the general ID algorithm can identify many more causal effects in arbitrary graphs, yet typically outputs algebraically complex expressions that are hard to estimate and interpret. We show that many such graphs can in fact be reduced to a standard front-door setting via front-door reducibility (FDR), a graphical condition on acyclic directed mixed graphs that aggregates variables into super-nodes $(\boldsymbol{X}^{*},\boldsymbol{Y}^{*},\boldsymbol{M}^{*})$. We characterize the FDR criterion, prove it is equivalent (at the graph level) to the existence of an FDR adjustment, and present FDR-TID, an exact algorithm that finds an admissible FDR triple with correctness, completeness, and finite-termination guarantees. Empirical examples show that many graphs far outside the textbook front-door setting are FDR, yielding simple, estimable adjustments where general ID expressions would be cumbersome. FDR therefore complements existing identification methods by prioritizing interpretability and computational simplicity without sacrificing generality across mixed graphs.

Abstract: Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a systematic framework for applying BERTopic to focus group transcripts using data from ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,075 utterances). We conducted comprehensive hyperparameter exploration across 27 configurations, evaluating each through bootstrap stability analysis, performance metrics, and comparison with LDA baseline. Bootstrap analysis revealed that stability metrics (NMI and ARI) exhibited strong disagreement (r = -0.691) and showed divergent relationships with coherence, demonstrating that stability is multifaceted rather than monolithic. Our multi-criteria selection framework yielded a 7-topic model achieving 18\% higher coherence than optimized LDA (0.573 vs. 0.486) with interpretable topics validated through independent human evaluation (ICC = 0.700, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.678). These findings demonstrate that transformer-based topic modeling can extract interpretable themes from small focus group transcript corpora when systematically configured and validated, while revealing that quality metrics capture distinct, sometimes conflicting constructs requiring multi-criteria evaluation. We provide complete documentation and code to support reproducibility.

<div> Keywords: feature selection, noise features, bootstrap hypothesis testing, Boruta, high-dimensional data<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of feature selection in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional datasets. Existing methods either have high computational costs or lack clear statistical criteria for stopping or assessing feature importance. The authors critique a common heuristic that inserts random noise features and retains predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature, highlighting its lack of theoretical basis. To overcome these issues, the paper introduces a novel feature selection algorithm that incorporates multiple random noise features and compares each real feature's importance against the maximum importance of noise features using a non-parametric bootstrap hypothesis testing framework. This provides a statistically grounded stopping rule. The paper includes statistical derivations to explain the principles behind the algorithm's design. The method is tested on simulated datasets with controlled settings and benchmarked against Boruta and Knockoff methods, showing improved recovery of meaningful features. Additionally, the approach is applied to diverse real-world datasets, outperforming conventional techniques such as Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Extra Trees. Overall, the proposed algorithm offers a principled, computationally efficient, and robust solution for feature selection that enhances reliable inference and predictive performance. <div>

Abstract: Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.

<title>A Unifying View of Linear Function Approximation in Off-Policy RL Through Matrix Splitting and Preconditioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Off-policy policy evaluation, Temporal Difference Learning, Fitted Q-Iteration, matrix splitting, convergence analysis<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper revisits the traditional understanding of Temporal Difference Learning (TD) and Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) in off-policy policy evaluation within reinforcement learning, challenging the view that they merely differ by the number of updates toward the target value function. The authors develop a unified mathematical framework under linear value function approximation, showing that TD, Partial Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), and FQI are iterations solving the same linear system but use different matrix splitting schemes and preconditioners. A key insight is that increasing the number of updates using the target network method shifts from a constant preconditioner (TD) to a data-feature adaptive preconditioner (FQI). This explains why TD convergence does not guarantee FQI convergence and establishes precise convergence relationships among these algorithms. The framework allows sharper theoretical results, characterizing convergence conditions without relying on traditional assumptions like feature linear independence. Using an encoder-decoder perspective, the paper also proves that smaller learning rates can aid convergence when large rates fail. Importantly, the work introduces matrix splitting into the convergence analysis for the first time, reveals new necessary conditions on feature properties for convergence, and demonstrates that common assumptions can be relaxed without losing convergence guarantees, especially in the on-policy stochastic TD setting. <div>

Abstract: In off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) tasks within reinforcement learning, Temporal Difference Learning(TD) and Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) have traditionally been viewed as differing in the number of updates toward the target value function: TD makes one update, FQI makes an infinite number, and Partial Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI) performs a finite number. We show that this view is not accurate, and provide a new mathematical perspective under linear value function approximation that unifies these methods as a single iterative method solving the same linear system, but using different matrix splitting schemes and preconditioners. We show that increasing the number of updates under the same target value function, i.e., the target network technique, is a transition from using a constant preconditioner to using a data-feature adaptive preconditioner. This elucidates, for the first time, why TD convergence does not necessarily imply FQI convergence, and establishes tight convergence connections among TD, PFQI, and FQI. Our framework enables sharper theoretical results than previous work and characterization of the convergence conditions for each algorithm, without relying on assumptions about the features (e.g., linear independence). We also provide an encoder-decoder perspective to better understand the convergence conditions of TD, and prove, for the first time, that when a large learning rate doesn't work, trying a smaller one may help. Our framework also leads to the discovery of new crucial conditions on features for convergence, and shows how common assumptions about features influence convergence, e.g., the assumption of linearly independent features can be dropped without compromising the convergence guarantees of stochastic TD in the on-policy setting. This paper is also the first to introduce matrix splitting into the convergence analysis of these algorithms.

<div> Keywords: mechanistic interpretability, causal interventions, out-of-distribution representations, behavioral null-space, Counterfactual Latent loss  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates whether causal interventions used in mechanistic interpretability create out-of-distribution (OOD) representations, potentially affecting the faithfulness of explanations derived from them. First, it theoretically and empirically shows that common causal intervention methods frequently shift internal model representations away from the model's natural distribution. Second, it provides a theoretical analysis of two types of such divergences: "harmless" divergences, which occur within the behavioral null-space and do not affect model behavior, and "pernicious" divergences, which activate hidden network pathways causing unintended behavioral changes. Third, to mitigate harmful divergences, the authors apply and modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss method from Grant (2025), which encourages the representations altered by causal interventions to stay closer to the model’s natural distribution. This adjustment reduces the likelihood of pernicious divergences while maintaining the interpretability benefits of interventions. Overall, the work offers valuable insights and a promising approach toward enhancing the reliability and validity of mechanistic interpretability techniques in complex models. <div>

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two cases of such divergences: "harmless" divergences that occur in the behavioral null-space of the layer(s) of interest, and "pernicious" divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we apply and modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) allowing representations from causal interventions to remain closer to the natural distribution, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of the interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Policy Optimization, Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization, Mixture-of-Experts  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet achieving stable and effective policy optimization remains difficult. Traditional token-level importance ratio methods suffer from high variance, especially in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, leading to unstable training updates. Existing group-based policy optimization techniques like GSPO and GRPO attempt to address this with hard clipping mechanisms, but these can impair the balance between learning stability and effectiveness. The proposed Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) method replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gating function that adaptively modulates off-policy updates to maintain useful learning signals. SAPO preserves sequence-level coherence akin to GSPO but avoids brittle hard clipping by enabling a continuous trust region, selectively down-weighting only problematic tokens rather than discarding entire sequences. Compared to GRPO, SAPO’s soft token-level scaling provides more informative and stable gradient updates. Empirical evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SAPO improves training stability and Pass@1 accuracy under comparable settings. Additionally, SAPO’s application to training the Qwen3-VL model series yields consistent performance improvements across diverse tasks and model sizes. Overall, SAPO offers a reliable, scalable, and more effective RL optimization strategy for training LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.

<div> autoregressive generation, point cloud, level-of-detail, multi-scale, ShapeNet<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations of autoregressive point cloud generation, which traditionally underperforms compared to diffusion-based methods due to its reliance on an arbitrary ordering of points. This ordering biases the model toward local, short-range predictions that fail to capture essential global structural properties such as symmetry and consistent topology. To overcome these issues, the authors propose PointNSP, a novel coarse-to-fine generative framework inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle commonly used in shape modeling. PointNSP operates by preserving the global shape structure at lower resolutions and progressively refining the geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction mechanism. This multi-scale approach respects the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, allowing rich interactions within each scale without the fragility of fixed sequential orderings. Experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that PointNSP achieves state-of-the-art generation quality within the autoregressive paradigm, surpassing both earlier autoregressive and strong diffusion-based baselines. Additionally, PointNSP benefits from greater efficiency in parameters, training time, and inference speed. The framework’s advantages become even more significant when generating dense point clouds with 8,192 points, highlighting its scalability and practical potential for high-resolution 3D generation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2503.08594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Multi-View Clustering, Ego Graphs, Mixture-of-Experts, Contrastive Learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses limitations in existing Multi-View Clustering (MVC) techniques that rely on coarse-grained graph fusion by proposing a novel method called Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). The MoEGCL framework consists of two main components: the Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF) and the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module. MoEGF innovatively constructs ego graphs for each sample and applies a Mixture-of-Experts network to achieve fine-grained fusion at the sample level, replacing conventional rough view-level fusion. The EGCL module enhances representation learning by aligning the fused embedding with view-specific representations and strengthens similarity across samples within the same cluster, rather than focusing solely on the same samples. This approach improves the granularity and quality of graph representations in MVC. Extensive experiments validate that MoEGCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep MVC methods. The authors also provide publicly accessible source code to support reproducibility and further research, available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

<div> Calibration, Uncertainty Quantification, Fisher–Rao Metric, Additive Log-Ratio, Reliability Scores  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces a geometric framework for both calibration and instance-level uncertainty quantification of neural network probability outputs, treating predicted probabilities as points on a probability simplex with the Fisher–Rao metric. Key contributions include: (i) the development of Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that generalize Platt scaling from binary to multi-class classification; (ii) the creation of geometric reliability scores that convert calibrated probabilities into actionable measures of uncertainty, enabling the deferral of ambiguous predictions for human review. Theoretical results provide consistency guarantees of the calibration estimator at a convergence rate of \(O_p(n^{-1/2})\) and establish concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters, facilitating validation set design. The authors conjecture the Neyman–Pearson optimality of their neutral zone classifier based on links to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical evaluation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification reveals that the proposed two-stage approach captures 72.5% of errors while deferring 34.5% of samples, cutting automated decision errors from 16.8% to 6.9%. Importantly, performance improvements are driven mainly by the reliability scoring rather than calibration alone. This work merges information geometry with statistical learning to provide formal guarantees and practical tools for uncertainty-aware classification critical in high-stakes applications requiring rigorous validation. <div>

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain -- even well-calibrated models provide no mechanism to identify \textit{which specific predictions} are unreliable. We develop a geometric framework addressing both calibration and instance-level uncertainty quantification for neural network probability outputs. Treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric, we construct: (i) Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems while extending naturally to multi-class settings, and (ii) geometric reliability scores that translate calibrated probabilities into actionable uncertainty measures, enabling principled deferral of ambiguous predictions to human review.
  Theoretical contributions include: consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples, reducing automated decision error rates from 16.8\% to 6.9\%. Notably, calibration alone yields marginal accuracy gains; the operational benefit arises primarily from the reliability scoring mechanism, which applies to any well-calibrated probability output. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees for uncertainty-aware classification in applications requiring rigorous validation.

<div> Subgrid parameterization, machine learning, climate models, online stability, hybrid physics-AI<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of integrating subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations into climate models to capture high-resolution physical effects without excessive computational costs. It highlights issues like online instability and inconsistent online performance that have hindered the operational use of ML parameterizations in long-term climate projections. To facilitate progress, the ClimSim dataset and an associated Kaggle competition were launched, inviting the broader machine learning community to tackle the offline problem. The authors evaluate the performance of ML emulators inspired by winning Kaggle team architectures when coupled with an interactive climate model featuring full cloud microphysics, a component traditionally vulnerable to online instability. Their findings demonstrate reproducible online stability across diverse ML architectures in a realistic, low-resolution setting with real-world geography, marking a significant milestone. Despite similar offline and online biases across architectures, responses to design choices like expanding input variables vary notably. Multiple Kaggle-derived architectures achieve state-of-the-art results for key metrics such as zonal mean bias and global root-mean-square error, suggesting that crowdsourcing ML solutions for offline training can effectively enhance online performance. Overall, this work underscores the promise of hybrid physics-AI climate simulations informed by community-driven ML advancements. <div>

Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains.

<div> Verified explanations, neural networks, scalability, FaVeX, robust explanations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Verified explanations provide a theoretically sound method to interpret neural network decisions, addressing their black-box nature. <br />2. Existing verified explanation techniques are limited by scalability due to reliance on multiple calls to neural network verifiers, which can have exponential worst-case complexity. <br />3. The authors introduce FaVeX, a novel algorithm to compute verified explanations more efficiently by combining batch and sequential processing of input features and reusing information from previous verification queries. <br />4. FaVeX improves scalability by optimizing how invariances in input features and feature assignments that change predictions are handled. <br />5. The paper proposes a new hierarchical definition for verified explanations called verifier-optimal robust explanations, which explicitly accounts for the incompleteness of network verifiers. <br />6. Experimental results demonstrate that FaVeX and verifier-optimal robust explanations significantly enhance scalability, enabling the production of meaningful formal explanations for neural networks with hundreds of thousands of nonlinear activations. <div>

Abstract: Verified explanations are a theoretically-principled way to explain the decisions taken by neural networks, which are otherwise black-box in nature. However, these techniques face significant scalability challenges, as they require multiple calls to neural network verifiers, each of them with an exponential worst-case complexity. We present FaVeX, a novel algorithm to compute verified explanations. FaVeX accelerates the computation by dynamically combining batch and sequential processing of input features, and by reusing information from previous queries, both when proving invariances with respect to certain input features, and when searching for feature assignments altering the prediction. Furthermore, we present a novel and hierarchical definition of verified explanations, termed verifier-optimal robust explanations, that explicitly factors the incompleteness of network verifiers within the explanation. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior scalability of both FaVeX, and of verifier-optimal robust explanations, which together can produce meaningful formal explanation on networks with hundreds of thousands of non-linear activations.

<div> Bayesian optimization, high-dimensional spaces, linear regression, Gaussian processes, molecular optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of performing Bayesian optimization (BO) in high-dimensional search spaces, a setting where many traditional BO methods struggle due to the curse of dimensionality.<br /><br />2. Existing state-of-the-art techniques try to counteract this by incorporating assumptions such as locality, sparsity, and smoothness into their models.<br /><br />3. Contrary to expectations, the authors show that Bayesian linear regression, one of the simplest approaches, outperforms these complex methods after applying a geometric transformation that prevents the model from overly focusing on boundaries.<br /><br />4. Using Gaussian processes with linear kernels, the method achieves competitive results on tasks with dimensionalities ranging from 60 to 6,000, demonstrating robustness and scalability.<br /><br />5. The linear model approach offers significant computational benefits, enabling closed-form sampling and linear computational scaling with the number of data points, which the authors leverage effectively in large-scale molecular optimization cases involving more than 20,000 observations.<br /><br />6. These findings challenge prevalent assumptions about BO in high-dimensional spaces and suggest a reconsideration of model complexity and prior assumptions when designing optimization methods for such domains. <div>
arXiv:2512.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional spaces have challenged Bayesian optimization (BO). Existing methods aim to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality by carefully encoding structural assumptions, from locality to sparsity to smoothness, into the optimization procedure. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these approaches are outperformed by arguably the simplest method imaginable: Bayesian linear regression. After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations. Coupled with empirical analyses, our results suggest the need to depart from past intuitions about BO methods in high-dimensional spaces.

<div> Keywords: tabular foundation model, biaxial attention, meta-learned in-context reasoning, few-shot learning, hierarchical decision routing<br /><br />Summary: Orion-Bix is a novel tabular foundation model designed to tackle challenges in real-world machine learning tasks involving mixed numeric and categorical data, weak feature structures, and limited labeled samples. It employs a biaxial attention mechanism that integrates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention layers, combining their outputs via multi-CLS summarization to effectively capture both local and global dependencies within data tables. The model features a label-aware in-context learning (ICL) head that adapts dynamically to new tasks and efficiently manages large label spaces using hierarchical decision routing. Orion-Bix is meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tabular datasets embedded with causal priors, enabling it to learn transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data types. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible package, it surpasses traditional gradient-boosting models and remains competitive with the latest tabular foundation models on public benchmarks. The integration of biaxial attention with episodic meta-training makes Orion-Bix robust and well-suited for few-shot learning scenarios in tabular data. The model and its implementation are publicly accessible on GitHub, promoting reproducibility and further research in the tabular learning domain. <div>

Abstract: Tabular data drive most real-world machine learning applications, yet building general-purpose models for them remains difficult. Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-BiX .

<div> Keywords: seismic horizon interpretation, U-Net, Context Fusion Attention, DBSCAN clustering, sparse annotations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of interpreting seismic horizons for subsurface characterization in hydrocarbon exploration, focusing on improving automated horizon tracking with deep learning.<br /><br />2. A novel hybrid framework is proposed that combines advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering techniques to enhance horizon continuity and geometric accuracy.<br /><br />3. The core innovation is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, which integrates spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates, boosting precision and surface completeness.<br /><br />4.

Abstract: Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, discrete computations, continuous manifolds, Riemannian metric, generalisation

<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates how neural networks perform discrete computations when processing continuous input data such as images. The authors analyze the representational geometry of neural networks by examining the Riemannian pullback metric across layers, revealing that network computations consist of two key functions: discretising continuous input features and applying logical operations on these discretised variables. They explore how different learning regimes, specifically rich versus lazy learning, lead to distinct metric and curvature structures within the networks' representational geometry. These geometric differences influence the networks' ability to generalise to unseen inputs, highlighting how the underlying learning dynamics affect performance. The study offers a novel geometric framework that provides insights into the internal mechanisms by which neural networks learn to map continuous inputs to discrete task outputs. This framework bridges gaps in understanding the transition from continuous data manifolds to discrete computations, with implications for improving network design and learning strategies to enhance generalisation on complex tasks. <div>
arXiv:2512.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.

<div> Keywords: large language models, MLP fact storage, parameter efficiency, Transformer integration, fact editing<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces an improved framework for constructing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that explicitly store factual knowledge within large language models (LLMs). First, the proposed MLP construction works for almost all feasible input-output pairs, overcoming limitations of previous methods. Second, it achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency by matching information-theoretic bounds for certain embedding types, thus maximizing facts stored per parameter. Third, the framework maintains compatibility with Transformer architectures, enabling effective factual recall within these models. The authors discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent trained MLPs, providing new insights into fact storage mechanisms. They identify a straightforward encoder-decoder approach that empirically matches the optimal facts-per-parameter scaling observed in gradient-trained MLPs across tested input-output pairs. Furthermore, the study reveals a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP’s fact storage capacity and its practical usability when integrated into Transformers. As a practical application, the paper demonstrates modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by replacing entire MLP components at once, showcasing the potential for flexible and efficient factual updates in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2512.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) can be attributed in part to their ability to efficiently store factual knowledge as key-value mappings within their MLP parameters. Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.

<title>TIE: A Training-Inversion-Exclusion Framework for Visually Interpretable and Uncertainty-Guided Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, anomaly detection, iterative refinement  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling deep neural networks to reliably detect inputs that lie outside their training distribution, a key issue for building trustworthy machine learning systems. The authors propose TIE (Training–Inversion–Exclusion), a novel framework that integrates predictive uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection into a single unified process. TIE transforms a standard multiclass classifier into an \((n+1)\)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class seeded with Gaussian noise to capture outliers. The method involves iterative closed-loop steps in each epoch: training the classifier, inverting it to reconstruct uncertain inputs, and excluding these uncertain inverted samples into the garbage class. Over iterations, these inverted samples shift from noise to interpretable class prototypes, offering visual insight into the learned data manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs either by assigning them to the garbage class or by producing low-confidence in-distribution predictions, without requiring external OOD datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks and metrics such as AUROC, AUPR, and FPR@95%TPR show that TIE achieves near-perfect OOD detection, with practically 0 false positive rate at 95% true positive rate, when trained on datasets like MNIST or FashionMNIST against diverse unseen OOD sets. This makes TIE a robust, interpretable approach for anomaly detection and uncertainty calibration. <div>
arXiv:2512.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often struggle to recognize when an input lies outside their training experience, leading to unreliable and overconfident predictions. Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \textit{uncertainty} and detect \textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \textit{AUROC}, \textit{AUPR}, and \textit{FPR@95\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \textbf{\(\!\approx\!\) 0 FPR@95\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised learning, physiological time series, dynamical systems, pretraining framework, representation learning<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses limitations in current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for physiological time series, which often rely on heuristic strategies or loosely defined generative tasks. It introduces a novel pretraining framework that leverages the information structure inherent in a dynamical systems generative model applied across multiple time series samples. The central insight is that class identity can be robustly captured by focusing on generative variables representing system parameters shared among similar samples, while ignoring noise unique to individual samples. Based on this insight, the authors propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective specifically designed for physiological time series. PULSE explicitly extracts shared system information and discards non-transferable, sample-specific noise. Theoretical analysis provides sufficient conditions for successful recovery of system information. Empirical validation is conducted with synthetic dynamical system experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, PULSE is applied to various real-world physiological datasets, showing its ability to learn meaningful representations that distinguish semantic classes, improve label efficiency, and enhance transfer learning performance across tasks. This framework thus offers a principled and effective approach to pretraining in physiological time series data environments. <div>
arXiv:2512.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) for physiological time series depends on the ability of a pretraining objective to preserve information about the underlying physiological state while filtering out unrelated noise. However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.

<div> Keywords: Sheaf Neural Networks, Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion, normalised sheaf Laplacian, heterophily, graph diffusion<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) enhance graph learning by associating local vector spaces (stalks) and linear restriction maps to nodes and edges, which provide an edge-sensitive inductive bias especially useful for handling heterophilic graphs and mitigating oversmoothing. <br />2. Existing Neural Sheaf Diffusion models typically depend on computationally expensive SVD-based normalization and dense restriction maps on each edge. These challenges grow with the stalk dimension, require frequent updates of the Laplacian operator, and result in unstable gradients.<br />3. To overcome these problems, the paper introduces Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a novel diffusion technique that represents the propagation operator as a degree-K polynomial of a normalized sheaf Laplacian. This is efficiently computed using a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator.<br />4. PolyNSD achieves an explicit K-hop receptive field within a single layer that does not depend on the stalk dimension. It includes a trainable spectral response expressed as a convex combination of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis functions.<br />5. The method stabilizes training via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated connections, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks, while using only diagonal restriction maps. This reduces computational costs and memory usage, reversing previous trends that tied performance to large stalk dimensions. <div>
arXiv:2512.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks equip graph structures with a cellular sheaf: a geometric structure which assigns local vector spaces (stalks) and a linear learnable restriction/transport maps to nodes and edges, yielding an edge-aware inductive bias that handles heterophily and limits oversmoothing. However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.

<div> Keywords: combat simulations, intelligent agents, deep reinforcement learning, hierarchical hybrid AI, wargaming

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges in developing intelligent agents for combat simulations used in wargaming. Traditional rule-based scripted agents are reliable and predictable in controlled, routine situations but lack flexibility in complex, dynamic scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents provide adaptability and learning capabilities, making them better suited for unexpected situations; however, they often operate as black boxes and struggle to scale effectively in large simulations. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel hierarchical hybrid AI approach that combines the strengths of both methods. The system employs scripted agents at the tactical level for routine decision-making, ensuring consistency and dependability. Meanwhile, RL agents are deployed at the strategic level, where adaptability and learning from experience are crucial. This hierarchical structure leverages the predictability of scripted methods and the flexibility of RL, enhancing overall agent performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in robustness, adaptability, and effectiveness within complex simulation environments. Consequently, this approach offers a promising framework for the design and training of intelligent agents in wargaming and other complex combat simulations by bridging the gap between scripted and learning-based methodologies. <div>
arXiv:2512.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of combat simulations in support of wargaming, the development of intelligent agents has predominantly been characterized by rule-based, scripted methodologies with deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches only recently being introduced. While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths. This integration is shown to significantly improve overall performance, providing a robust, adaptable, and effective solution for developing and training intelligent agents in complex simulation environments.

<div> IoT anomaly detection, DoS attacks, Sinkhorn Divergence, CTGAN augmentation, edge computing  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of anomaly detection in increasingly complex Internet of Things (IoT) edge networks, focusing on advanced Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and zero-day exploits amidst dynamic and imbalanced traffic conditions. The authors introduce SD-CGAN, a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network framework enhanced with Sinkhorn Divergence, designed specifically for robust anomaly detection in IoT edge environments. SD-CGAN integrates CTGAN-based synthetic data augmentation to tackle class imbalance by generating high-quality minority class samples. Sinkhorn Divergence is employed as a geometry-aware loss function, which contributes to improved training stability and mitigates mode collapse issues typical in GANs. The framework is rigorously evaluated using exploitative attack subsets extracted from the CICDDoS2019 dataset, which is known for representing realistic Distributed Denial-of-Service scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that SD-CGAN outperforms baseline deep learning models and other GAN-based methods in terms of detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the model maintains computational efficiency, making it well suited for deployment in resource-constrained edge computing devices within IoT networks. Overall, the proposed approach represents a significant advancement for enhancing security and resilience in IoT edge environments against sophisticated cyber attacks. <div>

The framework incorporates CTGAN-based synthetic data augmentation to address class imbalance and leverages Sinkhorn Divergence as a geometry-aware loss function to improve training stability and reduce mode collapse. The model is evaluated on exploitative attack subsets from the CICDDoS2019 dataset and compared against baseline deep learning and GAN-based approaches. Results show that SD-CGAN achieves superior detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for deployment in edge-enabled IoT environments.

<title>Scalable and Interpretable Scientific Discovery via Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)</title>

<div> Keywords: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, Gaussian Processes, Sparse Variational Inference, Computational Scalability, Structural Identification<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) improve interpretability by placing learnable univariate functions on network edges, serving as an alternative to standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, traditional KANs lack probabilistic outputs, which limits their utility in scenarios that require uncertainty quantification. Recent extensions incorporating Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide probabilistic modeling but rely on exact inference, which scales cubically with the dataset size \(N\), making them impractical for large datasets. To address this, the authors introduce the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), an architecture that combines sparse variational inference with the KAN framework. This method utilizes \(M\) inducing points and analytic moment matching to reduce computational complexity significantly—from \(O(N^3)\) down to \(O(NM^2)\) or linear in the number of samples—enabling efficient processing of larger scientific datasets. Additionally, the integration of a permutation-based importance analysis equips the network with the capability for structural identification, allowing it to pinpoint relevant input variables and classify functional relationships. This advancement broadens the applicability of probabilistic KANs and enhances their interpretability and utility in complex data analysis tasks. <div>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) by placing learnable univariate functions on network edges, enhancing interpretability. However, standard KANs lack probabilistic outputs, limiting their utility in applications requiring uncertainty quantification. While recent Gaussian Process (GP) extensions to KANs address this, they utilize exact inference methods that scale cubically with data size N, restricting their application to smaller datasets. We introduce the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), an architecture that integrates sparse variational inference with the KAN topology. By employing $M$ inducing points and analytic moment matching, our method reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$ or linear in sample size, enabling the application of probabilistic KANs to larger scientific datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that integrating a permutation-based importance analysis enables the network to function as a framework for structural identification, identifying relevant inputs and classifying functional relationships.

<title>Teleportation-Based Defenses for Privacy in Approximate Machine Unlearning</title>

<div> Keywords: approximate machine unlearning, privacy risks, membership inference, neural network symmetries, teleportation defense<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Approximate machine unlearning focuses on efficiently removing the impact of specific data points from trained models as a practical alternative to fully retraining them. However, it introduces privacy vulnerabilities, as attackers with access to models before and after unlearning can perform membership inference or data reconstruction attacks. The root causes of these risks are identified as large gradient norms associated with samples that need to be forgotten and the closeness of the unlearned model’s parameters to the original. To assess the severity, the authors propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, revealing that even state-of-the-art unlearning methods like NGP and SCRUB remain vulnerable. To address these threats, the paper introduces WARP, a defense mechanism that utilizes neural network symmetries to perform a "teleportation" reparameterization. This approach reduces the gradient energy of forget-set samples and increases parameter dispersion without sacrificing the model’s predictive performance. As a result, WARP effectively obfuscates signals from forgotten data, impeding attackers’ abilities to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or reconstruct forgotten data. The method demonstrates consistent privacy improvements across six different unlearning algorithms, significantly lowering adversarial advantage in both black-box (up to 64% reduction) and white-box (up to 92% reduction) attack settings, all while preserving accuracy on retained data. This work positions teleportation as a generalizable tool for enhancing privacy in approximate machine unlearning. <div>

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, offering a practical alternative to full retraining. However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning.

<div> Keywords: BioArc, Neural Architecture Search, foundation models, biological data, architecture design<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Foundation models have made significant advances in fields like NLP and computer vision, but applying their architectures directly to biological data has led to suboptimal outcomes.<br />2.

arXiv:2512.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.

<div> Keywords: non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, data-driven correction, DRIPS, Flow Map Learning, model-form uncertainty

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses the challenge of learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics characterized by time-dependent control inputs, which complicate direct temporal modeling. The authors propose reformulating the vehicle dynamics into a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems by locally parameterizing the time-dependent inputs. Two complementary data-driven approaches are developed. First, DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) constructs efficient linear surrogate models via lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation, enabling robust and data-efficient learning for systems with dynamics linearly representable in the lifted space. Second, FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network method, approximates parametric evolution maps without requiring explicit nonlinear treatment, and is further enhanced with transfer learning for model correction. This correction process can adjust misspecified prior models using sparse high-fidelity or experimental data without needing a predefined correction form. Numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models validate that DRIPS excels in data efficiency and robustness for learning non-autonomous dynamics, while FML delivers expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under limited data conditions. The framework provides a powerful combination of physics-based modeling and data-driven adaptation for vehicle dynamics. <div>
arXiv:2512.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics. Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.

<title>FiCoTS: Fine-to-Coarse LLM-Enhanced Hierarchical Cross-Modality Interaction for Time Series Forecasting</title>

<div> Keywords: Time Series Forecasting, Large Language Models, Multimodal Learning, Cross-Modality Interaction, FiCoTS<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of time series forecasting by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through a novel LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm, contrasting with the common LLM-as-Predictor approach. The authors highlight the difficulty in aligning semantic information between time series and textual modalities due to their distinct natures. To overcome this, FiCoTS is proposed—a fine-to-coarse multimodal framework that enhances forecasting performance by progressively integrating text and time series data across three levels: token-level, feature-level, and decision-level. At the token level, a dynamic heterogeneous graph filters noise and aligns time series segments with corresponding text tokens. The feature-level module employs a global cross-attention mechanism that connects each time series variable with relevant textual context, facilitating deeper semantic interaction. At the decision level, a gated network adaptively fuses outputs from both modalities to generate robust and accurate predictions. The synergy among these modules enables effective cross-modal information flow and supports temporal forecasting. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate FiCoTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy. The authors also commit to releasing their code publicly, promoting reproducibility and further research in multimodal time series forecasting. <div>
arXiv:2512.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.

<div> Variety, Big Data, Hyperparameter Optimization, Text Classification, Model Generalization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates the role of heterogeneity, termed "Variety," in Big Data classification tasks by comparing approaches across different data types: structured numerical data (Epsilon dataset) and unstructured textual data (Rest-Mex and IMDB datasets). Two key methodologies are employed: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization techniques, specifically Genetic Algorithms and Optuna implemented in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing using Apache Spark applied to large text corpora. The findings reveal a notable "complexity paradox" where, in high-dimensional numerical spaces, simpler optimized linear models like Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression outperform more complex models such as deep learning architectures and Gradient Boosting. For text domains, limited distributed fine-tuning capabilities cause complex models to overfit; instead, effective feature engineering strategies—namely Transformer-based embeddings like ROBERTa and Bayesian Target Encoding—allow simpler models to achieve better generalization. Ultimately, the work proposes a unified framework guiding algorithm selection depending on the dataset’s characteristics and computational infrastructure constraints, balancing model complexity with data variety and scalability considerations. <div>

Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of heterogeneity ("Variety") in Big Data by comparing classification strategies across structured (Epsilon) and unstructured (Rest-Mex, IMDB) domains. A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a "complexity paradox": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively. This work provides a unified framework for algorithm selection based on data nature and infrastructure constraints.

<div> Federated reinforcement learning, privacy leakage, gradient inversion, transition dynamics, regularization  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) allows multiple agents to collaboratively learn optimal policies without sharing their raw data, protecting local data privacy through gradient sharing. However, FRL remains vulnerable to privacy attacks where adversaries attempt to reconstruct private local training data by exploiting the shared gradients. Unlike in supervised federated learning, successful data reconstruction in FRL is more challenging because the reconstructed data must not only match the shared gradients but must also align with the true transition dynamics of the environment, reflecting real-world state transitions and rewards. To tackle this challenge, the authors introduce a new attack technique named Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA). RGIA incorporates prior-knowledge-based regularization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics during the optimization process, guiding the reconstruction toward data consistent with actual environment transitions. Theoretically, it is demonstrated that this regularization significantly reduces the space of possible solutions, filtering out spurious data reconstructions and narrowing the results to those that satisfy both the gradient information and true environment dynamics. Extensive experiments on control and autonomous driving tasks validate that RGIA can precisely reconstruct local private data with transition distributions closely matching the original, highlighting critical privacy risks in FRL systems. <div>

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables distributed learning of optimal policies while preserving local data privacy through gradient sharing.However, FRL faces the risk of data privacy leaks, where attackers exploit shared gradients to reconstruct local training data.Compared to traditional supervised federated learning, successful reconstruction in FRL requires the generated data not only to match the shared gradients but also to align with real transition dynamics of the environment (i.e., aligning with the real data transition distribution).To address this issue, we propose a novel attack method called Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA), which enforces prior-knowledge-based regularization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics during the optimization process to ensure that the reconstructed data remain close to the true transition distribution.Theoretically, we prove that the prior-knowledge-based regularization term narrows the solution space from a broad set containing spurious solutions to a constrained subset that satisfies both gradient matching and true transition dynamics.Extensive experiments on control tasks and autonomous driving tasks demonstrate that RGIA can effectively constrain reconstructed data transition distributions and thus successfully reconstruct local private data.

<div> Signed graphs, balance theory, differential privacy, adversarial learning, gradient perturbation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of privacy-preserving learning on signed graphs, which represent relationships with both positive and negative edges. It leverages balance theory to inform edge sign inference but highlights privacy risks where model parameters could leak sensitive link information. Traditional differential privacy (DP) methods using edge or gradient perturbation are inadequate for signed graphs due to cascading sign errors and high sensitivity from sign flips. To overcome this, the authors propose ASGL, an adversarial signed graph learning framework that ensures node-level DP while maintaining high utility. ASGL works by decomposing the signed graph into positive and negative subgraphs, enabling a novel gradient-perturbed adversarial module to better approximate signed connectivity distributions. This approach reduces cascading inference errors and lowers sensitivity through subgraph separation. Additionally, a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy integrated with balance theory helps accurately identify edge signs for generated node pairs and facilitates gradient decoupling to further minimize sensitivity. The effectiveness of ASGL is demonstrated via extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing it achieves a favorable balance between privacy protection and utility across various downstream tasks. <div>
arXiv:2512.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Tracing, problem-solving process, mathematical proficiency, large language model, interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitations of traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods, which typically rely only on whether students' answers are correct and overlook detailed problem-solving processes. To bridge this gap, the authors propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), a novel approach that integrates students' step-by-step solution behaviors to better capture multidimensional mathematical proficiency. The study introduces a new dataset named KT-PSP-25, specifically designed to support this enriched KT modeling. Central to the method is StatusKT, a framework that implements a teacher-student-teacher three-stage large language model (LLM) pipeline. In this pipeline, the first teacher LLM extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators from the problem-solving process, the student LLM simulates responses based on these indicators and the student’s process, and the final teacher LLM evaluates these responses to assess mastery over each proficiency indicator. Experimental evaluation on the KT-PSP-25 dataset demonstrates that StatusKT significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing KT methods. Importantly, beyond improved predictions, StatusKT offers interpretable explanations by explicitly modeling and communicating students’ mathematical proficiency states, thus contributing to explainability and personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.

<div> Keywords: offline learning, online adaptation, nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, generalization error, meta-LMS prediction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores a two-stage learning framework that combines offline learning and online adaptation to improve prediction performance in real-world intelligence systems dealing with nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. First, the authors analyze the offline-learning phase by deriving an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under datasets exhibiting strong correlations and distribution shifts. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to measure distributional discrepancies, providing a theoretical foundation for handling non-stationary data.

This combination effectively integrates the strengths of both offline and online approaches, resulting in superior prediction accuracy compared to using purely offline or purely online methods alone. The paper substantiates these findings with both theoretical guarantees and empirical experiments, showcasing the practical benefits of the proposed framework in handling correlated and evolving system data. <div>

Abstract: Real-world intelligence systems usually operate by combining offline learning and online adaptation with highly correlated and non-stationary system data or signals, which, however, has rarely been investigated theoretically in the literature. This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods. Both theoretical guarantees and empirical studies are provided.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent reinforcement learning, Nash Q-Learning, sample complexity, computational complexity, Markov games<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses key challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), focusing on two-player zero-sum Markov games. It introduces Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL), a model-free self-play algorithm designed to improve existing theoretical limitations such as memory inefficiency, high sample and computational complexity, and non-Markov or non-Nash policies. ME-Nash-QL can output an ε-approximate Nash policy with space complexity \(O(SABH)\) and sample complexity \(\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\varepsilon^2)\), improving over prior methods notably when the minimum of actions \(A\) or \(B\) is much smaller than \(H^2\). The algorithm achieves the lowest computational complexity, \(O(T \mathrm{poly}(AB))\), preserving Markov policies efficiently for \(T\) samples. Furthermore, it boasts a significantly reduced burn-in cost of \(O(SAB\, \mathrm{poly}(H))\), compared to earlier approaches requiring at least \(O(S^3 AB\, \mathrm{poly}(H))\). Overall, ME-Nash-QL offers substantial advances in memory use, sample efficiency, and computation in MARL for tabular settings with long horizons, contributing a practical and theoretically sound solution to zero-sum stochastic games. <div>

Abstract: The thriving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies how a group of interacting agents make decisions autonomously in a shared dynamic environment. Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\{A, B\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\min\{A, B\}\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.

<div> Robust Reinforcement Learning, Two-player Zero-sum Games, Offline Learning, Sample Complexity, Markov Games<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This work addresses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the context of robust two-player zero-sum Markov games (TZMGs) under offline settings, focusing on tabular robust TZMGs (RTZMGs). The authors propose a novel model-based algorithm named RTZ-VI-LCB, which leverages optimistic robust value iteration coupled with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty to ensure robust value estimation. This approach explicitly handles distribution shifts present in historical datasets, thereby ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties and the sim-to-real gap. The paper establishes that RTZ-VI-LCB achieves near-optimal sample complexity under conditions of partial data coverage and environmental uncertainty, meaning the method is efficient in terms of data requirements. Additionally, the authors develop an information-theoretic lower bound that demonstrates the sample complexity of their algorithm is tight and optimal with respect to both state and action space dimensions. This makes RTZ-VI-LCB the first algorithm to reach this level of theoretical optimality in the offline RTZMG setting. Experimental validation further supports the theoretical findings and shows that RTZ-VI-LCB sets a new benchmark for robust offline learning in two-player zero-sum Markov games. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), as a thriving field, explores how multiple agents independently make decisions in a shared dynamic environment. Due to environmental uncertainties, policies in MARL must remain robust to tackle the sim-to-real gap. We focus on robust two-player zero-sum Markov games (TZMGs) in offline settings, specifically on tabular robust TZMGs (RTZMGs). We propose a model-based algorithm (\textit{RTZ-VI-LCB}) for offline RTZMGs, which is optimistic robust value iteration combined with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty term for robust value estimation. By accounting for distribution shifts in the historical dataset, the proposed algorithm establishes near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under partial coverage and environmental uncertainty. An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, RTZ-VI-LCB is the first to attain this optimality, sets a new benchmark for offline RTZMGs, and is validated experimentally.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, Diffusion Models, Causal State Representation, Bisimulation Metric<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />A core challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is making accurate decisions when the agent faces incomplete and noisy observations, especially in perturbed and partially observable Markov decision processes (P$^2$OMDPs). Existing approaches struggle to simultaneously handle environmental perturbations and partial observability. To address this, the authors propose CaDiff, a novel framework that can enhance any RL algorithm by uncovering the causal structure underlying P$^2$OMDPs. CaDiff introduces the Asynchronous Diffusion Model (ADM), which uses a forward and reverse diffusion process with different step counts to interpret perturbations as noise that can be suppressed, effectively denoising the observations. A new bisimulation metric is developed within CaDiff to measure similarity between the partially observable environment and its denoised causal state representation. Theoretical guarantees are provided by deriving upper bounds on value function approximation errors incurred when transitioning from perturbed observations to denoised causal states, demonstrating a balance between reward and transition modeling errors. Experimental results on Roboschool benchmark tasks show that CaDiff improves returns by at least 14.18% against existing baselines. This work represents the first practical and theoretically grounded method to approximate causal states in RL using diffusion models. <div>

Abstract: A critical challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) is making decisions based on incomplete and noisy observations, especially in perturbed and partially observable Markov decision processes (P$^2$OMDPs). Existing methods fail to mitigate perturbations while addressing partial observability. We propose \textit{Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CaDiff)}, a framework that enhances any RL algorithm by uncovering the underlying causal structure of P$^2$OMDPs. This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model. Experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CaDiff enhances returns by at least 14.18\% compared to baselines. CaDiff is the first framework that approximates causal states using diffusion models with both theoretical rigor and practicality.

<title>S^2-KD: Semantic-Spectral Knowledge Distillation Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>

<div> Keywords: Spatiotemporal forecasting, Knowledge distillation, Semantic priors, Spectral representations, Multimodal models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses spatiotemporal forecasting, which typically depends on computationally heavy models to capture complex dynamics in data. To alleviate this, knowledge distillation (KD) is used to train lightweight student models. 2. Existing KD methods focus on preserving spectral properties like high-frequency details and low-frequency trends by operating on pixel-level signals, but they fail to incorporate the rich semantic and causal context behind these visual patterns. 3. The authors propose S²-KD, a novel KD framework that combines semantic priors with spectral representations to overcome these limitations. 4. The approach involves training a privileged, multimodal teacher model that uses textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for reasoning about event causes and decouples spectral components in its latent space. 5. A new distillation objective transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight, vision-only student, enabling the student to produce predictions that are both spectrally accurate and semantically coherent without needing textual inputs at inference time. 6. Experiments on benchmarks such as WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ demonstrate that S²-KD significantly improves simple student models and allows them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, especially in long-horizon and complex, non-stationary forecasting scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting often relies on computationally intensive models to capture complex dynamics. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios.

<div> Offline RL, Online RL, Tabula Rasa, Fine-tuning, Learning Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article presents a novel perspective by integrating offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as subroutines within tabula rasa online RL, leveraging the agent’s historical interactions as datasets for offline learning. It formalizes a flexible framework that supports multiple variants of offline RL incorporation, including final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. The paper introduces new techniques aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of this integration to enhance the efficiency of online learning. Extensive empirical analyses reveal three key findings: first, the success and effectiveness of the proposed framework are highly dependent on the specific nature and characteristics of the tasks involved. Second, the newly proposed techniques significantly boost the effectiveness of the framework, improving online learning outcomes. Third, the study finds that existing methods for online fine-tuning show overall ineffectiveness in this context, highlighting a gap in current research and a need for further investigation. This calls attention to the necessity for developing more robust online fine-tuning approaches to complement offline RL incorporation for better learning performance. <div>

Abstract: We take the novel perspective of incorporating offline RL algorithms as subroutines of tabula rasa online RL. This is feasible because an online learning agent can repurpose its historical interactions as offline dataset. We formalize this idea into a framework that accommodates several variants of offline RL incorporation such as final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. We further introduce convenient techniques to improve its effectiveness in enhancing online learning efficiency. Our extensive and systematic empirical analyses show that 1) the effectiveness of the proposed framework depends strongly on the nature of the task, 2) our proposed techniques greatly enhance its effectiveness, and 3) existing online fine-tuning methods are overall ineffective, calling for more research therein.

<div> synthesizable chemical space, molecular discovery, transformer model, property-based querying, molecular optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of exploring synthesizable chemical space to discover molecules that are both synthetically accessible and meet desired property criteria. <br />2. It introduces PrexSyn, a decoder-only transformer model trained on an unprecedented scale—billions of data points of synthesizable reaction pathways linked with molecular properties—facilitated by a high-throughput C++ data generation engine. <br />3. PrexSyn effectively reconstructs synthesizable chemical space with high accuracy and inference speed while capturing complex associations between molecular properties and synthetic pathways. <br />4.

Leveraging this querying capability, PrexSyn optimizes molecules against black-box oracle functions through iterative refinement, surpassing synthesis-agnostic baselines in sampling efficiency. <br />6. Overall, PrexSyn represents a significant advance in synthesizable molecular design by combining comprehensive chemical space coverage, rapid and efficient molecular sampling, and the flexibility to tailor generation to complex property-defined objectives. <div>
arXiv:2512.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.

<div> Keywords: zero-sum games, neural networks, von Neumann-Nash equilibrium, overparameterization, non-convex min-max optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses zero-sum games between neural networks, which are widely applicable in adversarial training, AI alignment, and robust optimization, with equilibria representing desirable system behaviors. <br />2. Despite the non-convex, non-concave nature of the underlying objectives, simple gradient methods empirically tend to converge, hinting at an underlying geometric structure. <br />3. The authors provide a theoretical framework explaining this convergence by leveraging hidden convexity and overparameterization in these neural network games.<br />4. Key contributions include identifying sufficient conditions related to network initialization, training dynamics, and width to guarantee global convergence to von Neumann-Nash equilibria in a broad class of two-layer neural network min-max games.<br />5. Technically, the work introduces (a) a novel path-length bound for alternating gradient descent-ascent schemes adapted to min-max games, and (b) a demonstration that hidden convex-concave geometry translates to a two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition with high probability under overparameterization, supported by random matrix theory tools.<br /> This is the first theoretical result of its kind for min-max games involving two-layer neural networks, advancing understanding of convergence in complex neural network game settings. <div>
arXiv:2512.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many emerging applications - such as adversarial training, AI alignment, and robust optimization - can be framed as zero-sum games between neural nets, with von Neumann-Nash equilibria (NE) capturing the desirable system behavior. While such games often involve non-convex non-concave objectives, empirical evidence shows that simple gradient methods frequently converge, suggesting a hidden geometric structure. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory.

<title>From Coefficients to Directions: Rethinking Model Merging with Directional Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Model merging, directional alignment, parameter space, feature space, neural collapse<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Model merging integrates multiple independently trained models into a single one without requiring joint retraining, reducing computational costs. Previous techniques focused mainly on parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning to combine model parameters effectively. However, these methods often neglect the importance of directional information present in both parameter and feature spaces, which can cause inconsistencies and structural incoherence when naively merging models. The problem is exacerbated because coefficient-based optimization assumes compatible directional patterns across models' feature spaces, an assumption challenged by Neural Collapse, which reveals structured directional variations in class features among separately trained models. To address these issues, the paper introduces a unified geometric framework called Merging with Directional Alignment (\method{}), which explicitly aligns directional structures in both parameter and feature spaces to enhance structural coherence. This directional alignment reduces inconsistencies and better preserves the intrinsic geometric relationships within models. Extensive experiments across different benchmarks, model sizes, and task setups demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional merging approaches by improving performance and robustness. Overall, the work highlights the critical role of directional alignment in successful model merging and provides a principled, practical method for achieving it. <div>
arXiv:2512.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a practical paradigm for integrating multiple independently trained models into a single model without joint retraining. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, na\"ive merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient. In this work, we emphasize the importance of \emph{directional alignment} and introduce a unified geometric framework, \emph{Merging with Directional Alignment} (\method{}), which aligns directional structures consistently in both the parameter and feature spaces. Our analysis shows that directional alignment improves structural coherence, and extensive experiments across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Parkinson's disease, gait detection, on-device time-series analysis, ultra-light CNN, wearable sensors

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study focuses on on-device time-series analysis for detecting gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) using short windows of triaxial acceleration data from wearable sensors, specifically targeting resource-constrained devices like low-power wearables and edge nodes. The researchers compare a magnitude thresholding method against three one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs): a literature baseline model using separable convolutions, and two ultra-light models—one purely separable convolutional and another incorporating residual connections. Experiments are conducted on the BioStampRC21 dataset with 2-second windows sampled at 30 Hz and use subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PD patients equipped with chest-worn IMUs. The best-performing ultra-light residual separable CNN model achieves a precision-recall area under curve (PR-AUC) of 94.5%, F1-score of 91.2%, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 89.4%, surpassing the baseline model despite having roughly 10 times fewer parameters (533 vs. 5,552). The smallest model with only 305 parameters still attains strong metrics (PR-AUC 94.0%, F1 91.0%, MCC 89.1%). Thresholding yields high recall (89.0%) but lower precision (76.5%), causing many false positives and variability across subjects. Sensor placement analysis indicates chest and thighs provide the most reliable data, while forearm sensors reduce precision and recall due to arm movement noise. Combining data from all sensor sites naively does not improve results beyond the single best site. Both compact CNN models run efficiently on STM32-class microcontrollers with sub-10 ms latency, making them suitable for on-sensor gating to minimize data transmission or storage. The work highlights ultra-light separable CNNs as an effective, resource-efficient alternative to thresholding for wearable PD gait detection on edge devices. <div>

Abstract: We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses limitations in current autonomous scientific discovery systems, which are often domain-specific, provide limited real-time researcher interaction, and lack mechanisms to decide when to stop exploration, causing inefficiencies and reproducibility issues.  
2.

3. SelfAI introduces two new evaluation metrics—Score and AUP_D—to measure efficiency in discovery and diversity in search strategies.  
4. The platform is benchmarked across varied tasks including regression, natural language processing, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery, consistently showing strong performance and reducing redundant experimental trials compared to traditional Bayesian optimization and other LLM-based methods.  
5. SelfAI facilitates seamless interaction with human researchers, enhancing usability and enabling integration of human expertise in the autonomous scientific discovery process. <div>

Abstract: Recent work on autonomous scientific discovery has leveraged LLM-based agents to integrate problem specification, experiment planning, and execution into end-to-end systems. However, these frameworks are often confined to narrow application domains, offer limited real-time interaction with researchers, and lack principled mechanisms for determining when to halt exploration, resulting in inefficiencies, reproducibility challenges, and under-utilized human expertise. To address these gaps, we propose \textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity. Across regression, NLP, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery benchmarks, SelfAI consistently achieves strong performance and reduces redundant trials compared to classical Bayesian optimization and LLM-based baselines, while enabling seamless interaction with human researchers.

<div> Keywords: epidemic forecasting, human behavior, graph neural networks, interpretability, interdependent signals

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the complex relationship between epidemic outcomes and human behavior and beliefs, highlighting the limitations of current forecasting models that often use simplistic mechanistic or opaque black-box approaches. The authors propose a novel graph-based forecasting framework that constructs a graph of interrelated epidemic and behavioral signals based on trend similarity. By employing graph neural networks (GNNs) on this graph, the framework enables prediction with a focus on interpretability, showing which signals are more predictable and identifying the key relationships that enhance forecasting accuracy. This method advances understanding of how multiple interdependent signals interact, offering insight into the mechanisms driving epidemic trends and behaviors. The approach has significant implications for the development of future simulation models that integrate diverse data sources, such as behavior, beliefs, and observed epidemic signals, thereby improving intervention planning and policy-making. The work marks an early step toward interpretable modeling in complex, multi-signal domains, aiming to bridge the gap between transparency and predictive performance in epidemic forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Epidemic outcomes have a complex interplay with human behavior and beliefs. Most of the forecasting literature has focused on the task of predicting epidemic signals using simple mechanistic models or black-box models, such as deep transformers, that ingest all available signals without offering interpretability. However, to better understand the mechanisms and predict the impact of interventions, we need the ability to forecast signals associated with beliefs and behaviors in an interpretable manner. In this work, we propose a graph-based forecasting framework that first constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity, and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) for prediction. This approach enables interpretable analysis by revealing which signals are more predictable and which relationships contribute most to forecasting accuracy. We believe our method provides early steps towards a framework for interpretable modeling in domains with multiple potentially interdependent signals, with implications for building future simulation models that integrate behavior, beliefs, and observations.

This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining data privacy in medical workflows, especially given the increased use of electronic patient records and strict data protection regulations. It highlights the potential of synthetic data as an alternative to real clinical data for training machine learning models but notes that existing generative models struggle with either time-series data or formal privacy guarantees. The authors propose enhancements to a state-of-the-art time-series generative model, improving its capability to handle longitudinal clinical data while integrating quantifiable privacy protections. They evaluate their approach using real patient data from chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ICU datasets, employing statistical tests, Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) experiments, and expert clinical reviews for validation. Their non-private version (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on key statistical metrics, demonstrating better data fidelity. The private variant (DP-TimeGAN) achieves a mean authenticity score of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, surpassing existing models on the privacy-utility trade-off. Importantly, clinician evaluations confirm that synthetic data generated by both models is comparable in quality to real clinical data. This work provides a robust framework to develop machine learning solutions for chronic conditions without compromising patient privacy. <div>

Abstract: Data privacy is a critical challenge in modern medical workflows as the adoption of electronic patient records has grown rapidly. Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, current generative models either struggle with time-series data or lack formal privacy guaranties. In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy.

<div> Fairness, Multi-task Learning, Heterogeneous Tasks, Asymmetric Constraints, Primal-Dual Optimization<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of fairness in multi-task learning (MTL), a relatively unexplored area compared to single-task fairness. It highlights the difficulty in applying existing fairness methods—primarily designed for classification—to MTL settings involving heterogeneous tasks such as classification, detection, and regression, especially when labels are partially missing. Existing approaches often constrain only the shared representation, allowing bias to persist in task-specific heads, which results in uneven fairness across tasks. Moreover, conventional fairness enforcement tends to treat fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, often degrading performance for groups that are already well-served. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose FairMT, a unified framework that supports all three task types under incomplete supervision by introducing an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism. This mechanism consolidates task-dependent asymmetric fairness violations into a single unified constraint. FairMT jointly optimizes utility and fairness through a primal-dual formulation, aided by a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy that manages the anisotropy introduced by task-specific heads. Experimental results on diverse multi-task benchmarks demonstrate that FairMT consistently improves fairness while maintaining or enhancing task utility. The authors also plan to release the code upon paper acceptance. <div>

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has been extensively studied in single-task settings, while fair multi-task learning (MTL), especially with heterogeneous tasks (classification, detection, regression) and partially missing labels, remains largely unexplored. Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy. Across three homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL benchmarks encompassing diverse modalities and supervision regimes, FairMT consistently achieves substantial fairness gains while maintaining superior task utility. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, policy optimization, entropy importance sampling, fine-tuning stability, mathematical reasoning benchmarks<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses challenges in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning, focusing on the trade-off between optimization granularity and training stability in group-based policy optimization frameworks like GRPO and GSPO. GSPO, while improving robustness through sequence-level optimization, suffers from inefficiencies such as gradient underutilization caused by its conservative clipping mechanism and uniform credit assignment that overlooks the varying importance of reasoning steps within sequences. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that balances fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO works by decomposing sequences into groups according to predictive entropy, which allows it to implement entropy-driven importance sampling for capturing heterogeneity within sequences, and entropy-adaptive clipping that dynamically adjusts trust regions based on the model’s uncertainty. The effectiveness of ESPO is validated with extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating faster convergence and achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, ESPO significantly improves accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark, increasing performance from 4.4% to 13.13%, showcasing its potential for enhancing LLM fine-tuning and reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning has increasingly relied on group-based policy optimization frameworks, such as GRPO and GSPO, to achieve stable fine-tuning at scale. However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.

<div> Keywords: bioactivity prediction, drug discovery, deep learning, graph representation, ChemBERTa  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The article addresses the challenge of accurately predicting molecular bioactivity against target proteins, which is a critical step in early-stage drug discovery. Traditional QSAR models, relying heavily on molecular descriptors, are limited in capturing the structural and contextual nuances of compounds, leading to reduced prediction accuracy. To overcome this, the authors propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning framework that integrates multiple data representations: molecular descriptors, spatial and relational information via graph-based compound representations, and contextual embeddings generated from SMILES strings using ChemBERTa. This multimodal feature integration enhances the model’s ability to capture comprehensive molecular information. The model is evaluated on the Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset, an important therapeutic target involved in DNA repair and oncology. Comparative analysis against conventional methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and XGBoost demonstrates that Rep3Net delivers superior bioactivity prediction performance. The study highlights Rep3Net's scalability and effectiveness in computational screening workflows for drug discovery, positioning it as a promising tool to accelerate identification of bioactive compounds through improved predictive accuracy and richer molecular feature representation. <div>

Abstract: In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.

<div> Hierarchical clustering, hyperbolic space, structural entropy, graph neural networks, graph structure learning

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses key challenges in hierarchical clustering, notably the lack of a global objective in most methods and the inadequacy of graph-based approaches that often operate on static or fully connected graphs without properly leveraging graph structure. The authors introduce HypCSE, a novel approach that maps data points into hyperbolic space and optimizes a relaxed form of continuous structural entropy (CSE) on enhanced graph structures. HypCSE employs hyperbolic graph neural networks to encode graph vertices, enabling effective representation in hyperbolic space. To enable differentiable optimization, the structural entropy objective is reformulated using the concept of the lowest common ancestor (LCA) in trees and then relaxed into continuous structural entropy by drawing an analogy between hyperbolic embeddings and hierarchical partition trees. Additionally, the model incorporates a graph structure learning component that dynamically updates the graph during training to better reflect the underlying hierarchical relationships among data points. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HypCSE outperforms existing hierarchical clustering methods, validating the effectiveness of integrating hyperbolic geometry, continuous entropy objectives, and adaptive graph structure learning for continuous hierarchical clustering. <div>
arXiv:2512.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental machine-learning technique for grouping data points into dendrograms. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE.

<div> Keywords: Explainable Boosting Machine, hyperparameter optimization, fairness, self-supervised pre-training, transparency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the "black-box" problem in machine learning by enhancing the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a transparent and accurate glassbox model. First, the study applies targeted hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian methods to improve model performance. Second, it introduces a custom multi-objective function for fairness during hyperparameter tuning, aiming to ensure equitable model decisions. Third, a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline is developed specifically for cold-start scenarios, where limited labeled data is available. These three methodologies are rigorously evaluated on benchmark datasets such as Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease. The results show that although the hyperparameter tuning leads to only marginal gains in the primary ROC AUC metric, it importantly shifts the model’s decision-making behavior. This demonstrates the significance of evaluating machine learning models beyond a single accuracy score, highlighting fairness and behavioral transparency. Altogether, the enhancements make the EBM not only more accurate but also more robust, equitable, and transparent. The work represents a crucial advancement toward building responsible AI systems that meet the strict requirements of ethical and regulatory compliance in high-stakes applications. <div>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of complex machine learning models in high-stakes domains has brought the "black-box" problem to the forefront of responsible AI research. This paper aims at addressing this issue by improving the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a state-of-the-art glassbox model that delivers both high accuracy and complete transparency. The paper outlines three distinct enhancement methodologies: targeted hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods, the implementation of a custom multi-objective function for fairness for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-start scenarios. All three methodologies are evaluated across standard benchmark datasets, including the Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease datasets. The analysis indicates that while the tuning process yielded marginal improvements in the primary ROC AUC metric, it led to a subtle but important shift in the model's decision-making behavior, demonstrating the value of a multi-faceted evaluation beyond a single performance score. This work is positioned as a critical step toward developing machine learning systems that are not only accurate but also robust, equitable, and transparent, meeting the growing demands of regulatory and ethical compliance.

<div> dataset distillation, supervised learning, regression, offline reinforcement learning, Bellman loss<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses dataset distillation, aiming to create a smaller synthetic dataset enabling models trained on it to perform comparably to those trained on the original dataset.<br /><br />2. For supervised regression in  \(\mathbb{R}^d\), the authors propose an efficient algorithm that matches losses on the training and synthetic datasets using a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors, avoiding direct model training.<br /><br />3. They provide a theoretical performance guarantee showing that only \(\tilde{O}(d^2)\) sampled regressors are needed so that any bounded linear model's mean squared error (MSE) loss on the synthetic data closely approximates that on the training data.<br /><br />4. Matching lower bounds of \(\Omega(d^2)\) are also proven, demonstrating the tightness of their analysis.<br /><br />5. Extending to offline reinforcement learning (RL), the algorithm distills datasets by matching the Bellman loss rather than the behavioral cloning objective used in prior works, effectively utilizing both reward and next-state information without policy model optimization.<br /><br />6. The resulting synthetic RL dataset ensures that any linear action-value predictor's Bellman loss is close to that on the original training data, enabling similar policy performance.<br /><br />7. Experiments validate the theoretical results and show performance improvements, confirming the utility of the proposed approach in both supervised regression and offline RL settings. <div>
arXiv:2512.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a training dataset, the goal of dataset distillation is to derive a synthetic dataset such that models trained on the latter perform as well as those trained on the training dataset. In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $\Omega(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.
  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical guarantees and observe performance gains.

<div> Keywords: Influence Maximization, Fairness, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-learning, Social Networks<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which seeks to select seed nodes to maximize influence spread in social networks, by incorporating fairness considerations. Real-world social networks exhibit structural inequalities with dominant majority and underrepresented minority groups, often leading traditional IM methods to favor majority groups disproportionately. The authors propose DQ4FairIM, a novel fairness-aware deep reinforcement learning approach that formulates the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using deep Q-learning combined with Structure2Vec network embeddings, their method learns policies that maximize the expected influenced nodes while enhancing fairness. They incorporate maximin fairness to prioritize improving influence among the least-represented group, thereby promoting equitable distribution across communities regardless of protected attributes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that DQ4FairIM outperforms both fairness-agnostic and existing fairness-aware baselines, achieving better fairness and a superior fairness-performance trade-off. Additionally, the learned policies generalize well without retraining to different problem instances, including variations in network size and seed budget. This highlights the method’s robustness and practical applicability in diverse social network settings where equitable influence spread is crucial. <div>
arXiv:2512.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem aims to select a set of seed nodes within a given budget to maximize the spread of influence in a social network. However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines. Additionally, our approach learns effective seeding policies that generalize across problem instances without retraining, such as varying the network size or the number of seed nodes.

<div> Heatwaves, Graph Neural Network, Temperature Forecasting, Localized Prediction, Global South<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Heatwaves are becoming more intense globally and represent one of the deadliest weather-related disasters. The impacts disproportionately affect marginalized communities and countries in the Global South where vulnerability is heightened by limited health resources, urban heat islands, and inadequate infrastructure.<br /><br />2. Existing numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often lack the resolution to effectively capture micro-scale temperature extremes, which limits timely warning dissemination particularly for the most vulnerable populations.<br /><br />3. The study proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed for high-resolution, localized temperature forecasting. This model leverages spatial learning capabilities and computational efficiency to produce temperature predictions at multiple future horizons, up to 48 hours ahead.<br /><br />4. The model was evaluated for Southwestern Ontario, Canada, demonstrating strong performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.93°C across forecasts spanning 1 to 48 hours and an MAE of 2.93°C specifically at the 48-hour horizon using 24-hour input data.<br /><br />5. Although tested in a data-rich environment, the framework offers potential for transfer learning strategies to develop equitable, localized temperature forecasts in data-scarce regions of the Global South, addressing an urgent need for improved heatwave resilience globally. <div>

Abstract: Heatwaves are intensifying worldwide and are among the deadliest weather disasters. The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region. While demonstrated here in a data-rich context, this work lays the foundation for transfer learning approaches that could enable localized, equitable forecasts in data-limited regions of the Global South.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Replicability, PAC RL, List Complexity, Stability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of replicability in reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms often show instability and sensitivity to training conditions. It formalizes the concept of list replicability within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, requiring that an algorithm outputs a near-optimal policy contained in a small list consistently across runs, with the list size defining list complexity. The authors distinguish between weak list replicability, ensuring the final policy lies within a small list, and strong list replicability, which further constrains the entire sequence of executed policies. Existing RL methods face exponential list complexity due to inherent instability. The main contribution is a new tabular RL algorithm that guarantees polynomial list complexity with respect to states, actions, and horizon length. Additionally, they extend their approach to strong list replicability, providing polynomial bounds on possible policy execution traces. This advance is enabled by a novel lexicographic planning strategy among near-optimal actions within random tolerance and a replicability-preserving state reachability test in stochastic environments. Finally, the authors demonstrate that integrating their planning strategy into practical RL settings can empirically improve algorithmic stability, offering insight into overcoming RL instability challenges in real applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicability is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as RL algorithms are empirically observed to be unstable and sensitive to variations in training conditions. To formally address this issue, we study \emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice. In particular, we show that empirically, our new planning strategy can be incorporated into practical RL frameworks to enhance their stability.

<div> Keywords: learned PDE solvers, Navier-Stokes, task difficulty transfer, classical solver compute, dataset curation

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the high computational cost of generating training data for learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, which often exceeds the cost of training the neural models themselves.  
2. It identifies key difficulty axes in PDE problems, such as more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers, that simultaneously challenge classical solvers and present opportunities for neural speedups.  
3. The authors systematically study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by varying task complexity through geometry (obstacle number and placement), physics (Reynolds number), and their combinations.  
4. The study finds that pre-generating many low and medium difficulty examples using classical solvers and including them in the training set significantly reduces the number of high-difficulty samples needed to learn complex physics effectively.  
5. By mixing low and high difficulty data, the required classical solver compute for dataset generation is reduced by a factor of 8.9 to achieve the same error as training solely on high difficulty data.  
6. These results emphasize the importance of strategically allocating classical solver computational resources across different difficulty levels rather than solely focusing on total compute, suggesting large efficiency gains from carefully curated pre-generated PDE data for neural solver training.  
7. The authors provide code for reproducing their experiments at the given GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs) on discrete state spaces, addressing the theoretical challenges distinct from the better-understood continuous diffusion models. The authors provide the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for DDMs on both finite spaces \(\mathbb{Z}^d_m\) and countably infinite spaces \(\mathbb{N}^d\), under mild assumptions. The study focuses on forward noising dynamics governed by masked and random walk processes. A key insight is the characterization of the backward diffusion process through a discrete score function whose monotonicity is critical for bounding the generation error. Importantly, the model’s complexity grows only linearly, up to logarithmic factors, with the dimension \(d\), contrasting the typical exponential scaling in discrete combinatorial settings, thereby enabling efficient scalability to high-dimensional data. Unlike previous work, the convergence proofs do not require the score function to be bounded. This framework covers a broad class of noising mechanisms including uniform noising on finite and infinite discrete spaces as well as masking-based noise. Overall, the paper lays foundational theoretical groundwork for discrete diffusion methodologies, paving the way for rigorous analysis and practical implementation of DDMs in various discrete data domains. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical underpinnings of Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs) on discrete state spaces. Unlike in the continuous setting-where diffusion models are well understood both theoretically and empirically-the discrete case poses significant challenges due to its combinatorial structure and the lack of rigorous analysis. In this work, we establish convergence guarantees for DDMs on both the finite space $\mathbb{Z}^d_m=\{0,...,m-1\}^d$ and the countably infinite space $\mathbb{N}^d$ under mild assumptions, focusing on forward masked and random walk dynamics. Similar to the continuous case, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function, whose monotonicity plays a central role in deriving the error bounds of the generated data. Notably, the complexity of our model scales linearly up to logarithmic factors, rather than exponentially, with the dimension, making it efficiently scalable to high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees that do not rely on the boundedness of the estimated score-covering not only uniform noising processes on $\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ and on $\mathbb{N}^d$, but also masking-based noising dynamics.

<div> Keywords: NLP classifier, clinical trials, neuroscience, BioBERT, probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study develops and evaluates a natural language processing (NLP)-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for neuroscience clinical trials. Given the high attrition rates and costs in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, especially in neuroscience where success rates are under 10%, early identification of promising trials could significantly improve resource allocation and reduce financial risk. The classifier utilizes data from ClinicalTrials.gov combined with success labels from the Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, extracting text-based features through statistical NLP methods. These features were incorporated into multiple non-large language model (non-LLM) algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.64 on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed trials from 1976 to 2024. A domain-specific language model, BioBERT, was then employed to build an LLM-based predictive model. This BioBERT model outperformed non-LLM models, attaining an ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, reflecting 40% less squared prediction error relative to benchmarks. Notably, the BioBERT predictions surpassed industry benchmarks 70% of the time. Overall, the integration of NLP-driven models into drug development aims to improve strategic decision-making and investment optimization in neuroscience clinical trials. <div>

Abstract: This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&amp;D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.

Abstract: Fairness in clinical prediction models remains a persistent challenge, particularly in high-stakes applications such as spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, where patient outcomes exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.
  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.
  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight. Our findings show that incorporating unsupervised subgroup discovery into a multitask framework enables more equitable, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions for surgical risk stratification.

<div> Keywords: combinatorial semi-bandit, matroid constraints, regret, time complexity, membership oracle<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints, a framework relevant for tasks such as diverse online recommendations. While existing methods achieve optimal regret — meaning their performance matches theoretical lower bounds — they often suffer from high computational costs, especially when dealing with large matroids or expensive membership oracles. The authors identify and exploit an underlying unimodal structure within the matroid semi-bandit problem, enabling a significant reduction in the number of membership oracle calls to \(\mathcal{O}(\log \log T)\) iterations over time horizon \(T\). This results in a substantially improved time complexity for the learning process, maintaining near-optimal performance. Empirical evaluations conducted across various matroid benchmarks demonstrate two main results: (i) the proposed method incurs no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming that the trade-off in performance is negligible; and (ii) there is a clear reduction in overall computation time and the number of costly membership oracle calls. This work thus offers a practical advancement by making combinatorial semi-bandit learning more scalable and efficient without compromising theoretical guarantees. <div>
arXiv:2512.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints. The regret achieved by recent approaches is optimal, in the sense that it matches the lower bound. Yet, time complexity remains an issue for large matroids or for matroids with costly membership oracles (e.g. online recommendation that ensures diversity). This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$. This results in an overall improved time complexity of the learning process. Experiments conducted on various matroid benchmarks show (i) no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art approaches; and (ii) reduced time complexity and number of calls to the membership oracle.

<div> Keywords: Graph link prediction, Generalized Graph Transformer, Variational Autoencoder, Self-attention, Laplacian positional encoding<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE), a novel model designed for the task of graph link prediction. It combines a Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with a Variational Autoencoder framework to effectively capture relational dependencies within graphs. Unlike traditional GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN models that rely heavily on message passing, GGT-VAE employs a transformer-style global self-attention mechanism, enabling it to model structural patterns across nodes in a global context. Additionally, the model incorporates Laplacian positional encoding to better embed structural information in the latent space. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision metrics. This work represents one of the first attempts to fuse generalized graph transformers with variational frameworks for graph structure generation, marking progress in both generative modeling and graph representation learning. Overall, GGT-VAE opens new pathways for leveraging transformer architectures in graph-based tasks without the limitations of message passing, showing promising results in link prediction applications. <div>

Abstract: Graph link prediction has long been a central problem in graph representation learning in both network analysis and generative modeling. Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with catastrophic forgetting posing a significant barrier to deploying neural networks in dynamic environments. Inspired by biological memory consolidation mechanisms, we propose a novel framework for generative replay that leverages predictive coding principles to mitigate forgetting. We present a comprehensive comparison between predictive coding-based and backpropagation-based gen- erative replay strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on task retention and transfer efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that predictive coding-based replay achieves superior retention performance (average 15.3% improvement) while maintaining competitive transfer efficiency, suggesting that biologically-inspired mechanisms can offer principled solutions to continual learning challenges. The proposed framework provides insights into the relationship between biological memory processes and artificial learning systems, opening new avenues for neuroscience-inspired AI research.

<title>Financial Text Classification Based On rLoRA Finetuning On Qwen3-8B model</title>

Abstract: Financial text classification has increasingly become an important aspect in quantitative trading systems and related tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis and the classification of financial news. In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications. Qwen3-8B provides a very promising base for advancing dynamic quantitative trading systems in the future.

Abstract: We introduce DP-FinDiff, a differentially private diffusion framework for synthesizing mixed-type tabular data. DP-FinDiff employs embedding-based representations for categorical features, reducing encoding overhead and scaling to high-dimensional datasets. To adapt DP-training to the diffusion process, we propose two privacy-aware training strategies: an adaptive timestep sampler that aligns updates with diffusion dynamics, and a feature-aggregated loss that mitigates clipping-induced bias. Together, these enhancements improve fidelity and downstream utility without weakening privacy guarantees. On financial and medical datasets, DP-FinDiff achieves 16-42% higher utility than DP baselines at comparable privacy levels, demonstrating its promise for safe and effective data sharing in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The development of autonomous machine learning (ML) agents capable of end-to-end data science workflows represents a significant frontier in artificial intelligence. These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.

arXiv:2512.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical statistical inference and learning theory often fail to explain the success of modern neural networks. A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $\lambda_{\alpha}$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders). Our experiments recover known scaling laws while others yield meaningful deviations from theoretical expectations. Overall, our paper illustrates the many merits of SLT for understanding neural network phase transitions, and poses open research questions for the field.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an important tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.

Abstract: Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery. The benchmark is available at: https://github.com/ZhiGroup/DAVIS-complete

arXiv:2512.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog circuit optimization is typically framed as black-box search over arbitrary smooth functions, yet device physics constrains performance mappings to structured families: exponential device laws, rational transfer functions, and regime-dependent dynamics. Off-the-shelf Gaussian-process surrogates impose globally smooth, stationary priors that are misaligned with these regime-switching primitives and can severely misfit highly nonlinear circuits at realistic sample sizes (50--100 evaluations). We demonstrate that pre-trained tabular models encoding these primitives enable reliable optimization without per-circuit engineering. Circuit Prior Network (CPN) combines a tabular foundation model (TabPFN v2) with Direct Expected Improvement (DEI), computing expected improvement exactly under discrete posteriors rather than Gaussian approximations. Across 6 circuits and 25 baselines, structure-matched priors achieve $R^2 \approx 0.99$ in small-sample regimes where GP-Mat\'ern attains only $R^2 = 0.16$ on Bandgap, deliver $1.05$--$3.81\times$ higher FoM with $3.34$--$11.89\times$ fewer iterations, and suggest a shift from hand-crafting models as priors toward systematic physics-informed structure identification. Our code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Covariate distribution shift occurs when certain structural features present in the test set are absent from the training set. It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning. MPAIACL leverages contrastive learning to unlock the full potential of vector representations by harnessing their intrinsic information. Through extensive experiments, MPAIACL demonstrates its robust generalization and effectiveness, as it performs well compared with other baselines across various public OOD datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/MPAIACL.

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by assessing the consistency between generated outputs and human preferences. However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales. Our work highlights the potential of upcycle and merge MoE structures for improving both robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models.

Abstract: Typical deep clustering methods, while achieving notable progress, can only provide one clustering result per dataset. This limitation arises from their assumption of a fixed underlying data distribution, which may fail to meet user needs and provide unsatisfactory clustering outcomes. Our work investigates how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can be leveraged to achieve user-driven clustering, emphasizing their adaptability to user-specified semantic requirements. However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria. We also employ a lightweight clustering head augmented with pseudo-label learning, significantly enhancing clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance on diverse datasets and metrics.

Abstract: Wind farms with integrated energy storage, or hybrid wind farms, are able to store energy and dispatch it to the grid following an operational strategy. For individual wind farms with integrated energy storage capacity, data-driven dispatch strategies using localized grid demand and market conditions as input parameters stand to maximize wind energy value. Synthetic power generation data modeled on atmospheric conditions provide another avenue for improving the robustness of data-driven dispatch strategies. To these ends, the present work develops two deep learning frameworks: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch strategy tailored to individual wind farms, which reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years of simulated operations in a case study at the Pyron site; and a power generation modeling framework that reduced RMSE by 9.5% and improved power curve similarity by 18.9% when validated on the Palouse wind farm. Together, these models pave the way for more robust, data-driven dispatch strategies and potential extensions to other renewable energy systems.

Abstract: Humans build viewpoint-independent cognitive maps through navigation, enabling intuitive reasoning about object permanence and spatial relations. We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.

<title>Preventing Model Collapse via Contraction-Conditioned Neural Filters</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network filter method based on contraction operators to address model collapse in recursive training of generative models. Unlike \cite{xu2024probabilistic}, which requires superlinear sample growth ($O(t^{1+s})$), our approach completely eliminates the dependence on increasing sample sizes within an unbiased estimation framework by designing a neural filter that learns to satisfy contraction conditions. We develop specialized neural network architectures and loss functions that enable the filter to actively learn contraction conditions satisfying Assumption 2.3 in exponential family distributions, thereby ensuring practical application of our theoretical results. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when the learned contraction conditions are satisfied, estimation errors converge probabilistically even with constant sample sizes, i.e., $\limsup_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(\|\mathbf{e}_t\|>\delta)=0$ for any $\delta>0$. Experimental results show that our neural network filter effectively learns contraction conditions and prevents model collapse under fixed sample size settings, providing an end-to-end solution for practical applications.

<title>Forecasting India's Demographic Transition Under Fertility Policy Scenarios Using hybrid LSTM-PINN Model</title>

Abstract: Demographic forecasting remains a fundamental challenge for policy planning in rapidly evolving nations such as India, where fertility transitions, policy interventions, and age structured dynamics interact in complex ways. In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size. Stricter controls intensify ageing and reduce labour force participation, whereas relaxed policies support workforce growth but increase population pressure. Our findings suggest that the hybrid LSTM-PINN is an effective approach for demographic forecasting, offering accuracy with interpretability. Beyond methodological novelty, this work provides actionable insights for India's demographic policy debates, highlighting the need for balanced fertility interventions to ensure sustainable socio-economic development.

<title>Provable Benefit of Sign Descent: A Minimal Model Under Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance</title>

Abstract: Adaptive optimization methods (such as Adam) play a major role in LLM pretraining, significantly outperforming Gradient Descent (GD). Recent studies have proposed new smoothness assumptions on the loss function to explain the advantages of adaptive algorithms with structured preconditioners, e.g., coordinate-wise or layer-wise, and steepest descent methods w.r.t. non-euclidean norms, e.g., $\ell_\infty$ norm or spectral norm, over GD. However, it remains unclear how these smoothness assumptions manifest in language modelling tasks. In this work, we aim to analyze the benefit of $\ell_\infty$-norm descent (a.k.a. sign descent) directly from properties of the data distribution, namely, heavy-tailed class imbalance. We propose a minimal yet representative setting of next-token prediction, where we can provably show faster convergence of coordinate-wise algorithms such as Sign descent (steepest descent w.r.t. $\ell_\infty$ norm) over normalized GD (steepest descent w.r.t. to $\ell_2$ norm) in the presence of heavy tail class imbalance.

<title>Text Mining Analysis of Symptom Patterns in Medical Chatbot Conversations</title>

Abstract: The fast growth of digital health systems has led to a need to better comprehend how they interpret and represent patient-reported symptoms. Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots.

<title>AI Agent for Source Finding by SoFiA-2 for SKA-SDC2</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00769</link>

Abstract: Source extraction is crucial in analyzing data from next-generation, large-scale sky surveys in radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.

<title>What Is Preference Optimization Doing, How and Why?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Preference optimization (PO) is indispensable for large language models (LLMs), with methods such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieving great success. A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: To address the gap in humanoid robot cognitive systems regarding the lack of a time-updable mediating thought space between semantics and continuous control, this study constructs and trains a VLA model named "Sigma" that runs on a single RTX 4090. It uses the open-source pi05_base model as a foundation and preprocesses svla_so101_pickplace into a training dataset. The researcher independently designed an architecture for a vision-language-action model that combines deep semantic understanding and association to achieve telepathic communication. The training process involved repeated optimizations of data preprocessing, LoRA fine-tuning, and the inference-stage adapter. The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged. It demonstrates that mind-responsive alignment control is quantified through an architecture that combines deep understanding of semantics and association without retraining the base model, which provides reproducible experience for semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior in humanoid robots.

<title>Limitations of Using Identical Distributions for Training and Testing When Learning Boolean Functions</title>

Abstract: When the distributions of the training and test data do not coincide, the problem of understanding generalization becomes considerably more complex, prompting a variety of questions. In this work, we focus on a fundamental one: Is it always optimal for the training distribution to be identical to the test distribution? Surprisingly, assuming the existence of one-way functions, we find that the answer is no. That is, matching distributions is not always the best scenario, which contrasts with the behavior of most learning methods. Nonetheless, we also show that when certain regularities are imposed on the target functions, the standard conclusion is recovered in the case of the uniform distribution.

<title>Estimating the Effective Rank of Vision Transformers via Low-Rank Factorization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep networks are heavily over-parameterized, yet their learned representations often admit low-rank structure. We introduce a framework for estimating a model's intrinsic dimensionality by treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace of the model's full capacity. Our approach: train a full-rank teacher, factorize its weights at multiple ranks, and train each factorized student via distillation to measure performance as a function of rank.
  We define effective rank as a region, not a point: the smallest contiguous set of ranks for which the student reaches 85-95% of teacher accuracy. To stabilize estimates, we fit accuracy vs. rank with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify crossings of the normalized curve. We also define the effective knee as the rank maximizing perpendicular distance between the smoothed accuracy curve and its endpoint secant; an intrinsic indicator of where marginal gains concentrate.
  On ViT-B/32 fine-tuned on CIFAR-100 (one seed, due to compute constraints), factorizing linear blocks and training with distillation yields an effective-rank region of approximately [16, 34] and an effective knee at r* ~ 31. At rank 32, the student attains 69.46% top-1 accuracy vs. 73.35% for the teacher (~94.7% of baseline) while achieving substantial parameter compression. We provide a framework to estimate effective-rank regions and knees across architectures and datasets, offering a practical tool for characterizing the intrinsic dimensionality of deep models.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms constitute a branch of optimization that is concerned with discovering a diverse and high-quality set of solutions to an optimization problem. Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric. Furthermore, we leverage it to derive a novel differentiable QD algorithm, \emph{Soft QD Using Approximated Diversity (SQUAD)}, and demonstrate empirically that it is competitive with current state of the art methods on standard benchmarks while offering better scalability to higher dimensional problems.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) remains vulnerable to label imbalance, spurious correlations, and distribution shifts, challenges that are particularly detrimental to rare label prediction. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal Cooperative Game (CCG) framework, which conceptualizes MLC as a cooperative multi-player interaction. CCG unifies explicit causal discovery via Neural Structural Equation Models with a counterfactual curiosity reward to drive robust feature learning. Furthermore, it incorporates a causal invariance loss to ensure generalization across diverse environments, complemented by a specialized enhancement strategy for rare labels. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that CCG substantially outperforms strong baselines in both rare label prediction and overall robustness. Through rigorous ablation studies and qualitative analysis, we validate the efficacy and interpretability of our components, underscoring the potential of synergizing causal inference with cooperative game theory for advancing multi-label learning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are Large Language Models (LLMs) explicitly trained to generate long-form Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), achieving impressive success on challenging tasks like math and programming. However, their underlying reasoning "algorithms" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/ReJump.

<title>Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Regression using Contextualised Normalizing Flows</title>

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in deep regression models is important both for understanding the confidence of the model and for safe decision-making in high-risk domains. Existing approaches that yield prediction intervals overlook distributional information, neglecting the effect of multimodal or asymmetric distributions on decision-making. Similarly, full or approximated Bayesian methods, while yielding the predictive posterior density, demand major modifications to the model architecture and retraining. We introduce MCNF, a novel post hoc uncertainty quantification method that produces both prediction intervals and the full conditioned predictive distribution. MCNF operates on top of the underlying trained predictive model; thus, no predictive model retraining is needed. We provide experimental evidence that the MCNF-based uncertainty estimate is well calibrated, is competitive with state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, and provides richer information for downstream decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training over distributed multimedia data but suffers acutely from statistical heterogeneity and communication constraints, especially when clients deploy large models. Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.

<title>Topological Federated Clustering via Gravitational Potential Fields under Local Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Clustering non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data under local differential privacy (LDP) in federated settings presents a critical challenge: preserving privacy while maintaining accuracy without iterative communication. Existing one-shot methods rely on unstable pairwise centroid distances or neighborhood rankings, degrading severely under strong LDP noise and data heterogeneity. We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as "mass" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $\epsilon$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($\epsilon < 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.

Abstract: Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.
  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).
  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is essential for modern risk management, allowing decision-makers to quantify uncertainty in critical systems. This paper tackles this challenge using the volatile REFIT household dataset, which is complicated by a large structural data gap. We first address this by conducting a rigorous comparative experiment to select a Seasonal Imputation method, demonstrating its superiority over linear interpolation in preserving the data's underlying distribution. We then systematically evaluate a hierarchy of models, progressing from classical baselines (SARIMA, Prophet) to machine learning (XGBoost) and advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM). Our findings reveal that classical models fail to capture the data's non-linear, regime-switching behavior. While the LSTM provided the most well-calibrated probabilistic forecast, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) emerged as the superior all-round model, achieving the best point forecast accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and producing safer, more cautious prediction intervals that effectively capture extreme volatility.

Abstract: Modern deep networks are heavily overparameterized yet often generalize well, suggesting a form of low intrinsic complexity not reflected by parameter counts. We study this complexity at initialization through the effective rank of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Gram matrix, $r_{\text{eff}}(K) = (\text{tr}(K))^2/\|K\|_F^2$. For i.i.d. data and the infinite-width NTK $k$, we prove a constant-limit law $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[r_{\text{eff}}(K_n)] = \mathbb{E}[k(x, x)]^2 / \mathbb{E}[k(x, x')^2] =: r_\infty$, with sub-Gaussian concentration. We further establish finite-width stability: if the finite-width NTK deviates in operator norm by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$ (width $m$), then $r_{\text{eff}}$ changes by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$. We design a scalable estimator using random output probes and a CountSketch of parameter Jacobians and prove conditional unbiasedness and consistency with explicit variance bounds. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20/56 (widths 16/32) across $n \in \{10^3, 5\times10^3, 10^4, 2.5\times10^4, 5\times10^4\}$, we observe $r_{\text{eff}} \approx 1.0\text{--}1.3$ and slopes $\approx 0$ in $n$, consistent with the theory, and the kernel-moment prediction closely matches fitted constants.

Abstract: We introduce HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced high-fidelity $1$-bit post-training quantization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

Abstract: A common and effective means for improving language model capabilities involves finetuning a ``student'' language model's parameters on generations from a more proficient ``teacher'' model. Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models.

Abstract: Zero-shot foundation models (FMs) promise training-free prediction on tabular data, yet their hardware footprint remains poorly characterized. We present a fully reproducible benchmark that reports test accuracy together with wall-clock latency, peak CPU RAM, and peak GPU VRAM on four public datasets: Adult-Income, Higgs-100k, Wine-Quality, and California-Housing. Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table. These results quantify the substantial hardware-versus-accuracy trade-offs in current tabular FMs and provide an open baseline for future efficiency-oriented research.

<title>Beyond High-Entropy Exploration: Correctness-Aware Low-Entropy Segment-Based Advantage Shaping for Reasoning LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.

Abstract: Group symmetries provide a powerful inductive bias for reinforcement learning (RL), enabling efficient generalization across symmetric states and actions via group-invariant Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, real-world environments almost never realize fully group-invariant MDPs; dynamics, actuation limits, and reward design usually break symmetries, often only locally. Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking. Experiments across Grid-World, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that PE-DQN and PE-SAC significantly outperform baselines, highlighting the importance of selective symmetry exploitation for robust and sample-efficient RL.

Abstract: Accurate Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for collaborative design of complex systems, Digital Twin building, and maintenance ahead of time. However, the collaborative industrial environment presents new challenges for MTS forecasting models: models should decouple complex inter-variable dependencies while addressing non-stationary distribution shift brought by environmental changes. To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies. Most importantly, aiming at non-stationarity, a Frequency-Domain Stationarity Correction mechanism adaptively suppresses distribution shift impacts from environment change by spectrum alignment. Evaluations on seven benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better forecasting accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work shows great promise as a new forecasting engine for industrial collaborative systems.

Abstract: Organisms constantly pivot between tasks such as evading predators, foraging, traversing rugged terrain, and socializing, often within milliseconds. Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: For patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy, the time between clinic visits is full of uncertainties and risks of unmonitored side effects. To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event. This work establishes the feasibility of multi-modal AI RPM for cancer care and offers a path toward more proactive patient support.(Accepted at Europe NeurIPS 2025 Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare Workshop)

Abstract: Quantization to low bitwidth is a standard approach for deploying large language models, however, a few extreme weights and activations stretch the dynamic range and reduce the effective resolution of the quantizer. A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet it often relies on carefully designed programmatic reward functions to guide agent behavior. Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Echocardiogram datasets enable training deep learning models to automate interpretation of cardiac ultrasound, thereby expanding access to accurate readings of diagnostically-useful images. However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.

Abstract: Neural oscillators, originating from the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), have demonstrated competitive performance in stably learning causal mappings between long-term sequences or continuous temporal functions. However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.

<title>Operator-Theoretic Framework for Gradient-Free Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning must address heterogeneity, strict communication and computation limits, and privacy while ensuring performance. We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent {\alpha} < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.

Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings. We demonstrate these advantages in several high-dimensional control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where AltNet outperforms various relevant baseline methods, as well as state-of-the-art reset-based techniques.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have opened new avenues for machine learning applications due to their ability to adapt to new and unseen tasks with minimal or no further training. Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) -- FMs trained on time-series data -- have shown strong performance on classification, regression, and imputation tasks. Recent pipelines combine TSFMs with task-specific encoders, decoders, and adapters to improve performance; however, assembling such pipelines typically requires ad hoc, model-specific implementations that hinder modularity and reproducibility. We introduce FMTK, an open-source, lightweight and extensible toolkit for constructing and fine-tuning TSFM pipelines via standardized backbone and component abstractions. FMTK enables flexible composition across models and tasks, achieving correctness and performance with an average of seven lines of code. https://github.com/umassos/FMTK

arXiv:2512.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning is essential for large generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) to comply with the right to be forgotten and prevent undesired content generation without costly retraining. Existing approaches, such as Static-lambda SISS for diffusion models, rely on a fixed mixing weight lambda, which is suboptimal because the required unlearning strength varies across samples and training stages.
  We propose Adaptive-lambda SISS, a principled extension that turns lambda into a latent variable dynamically inferred at each training step. A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.
  We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.
  Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, key for early warning of disasters, currently relies on computationally expensive and restrictive methods that limit access to many countries. To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization. This study suggests the potential of the PIANO and serves as a good baseline for physics-informed precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.

<title>Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.
  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.
  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.

Abstract: AI systems deployed in the real world must contend with distractions and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise that can destabilize their policies and lead to unsafe behavior. While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3. Together, these results highlight the robustness of our approach across world modeling domains. We release our code at https://github.com/Bluefin-Tuna/WISER .

<title>Mode-Conditioning Unlocks Superior Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Parallel sampling promises substantial gains in test-time scaling, but its effectiveness is sharply limited by diversity collapse, where models concentrate on a few modes and repeated samples produce the same mistakes. We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k. We further show that gradient clustering enables ModC without explicit mode labels, yielding up to 10% gains on datasets such as NuminaMath. Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods. These results demonstrate that standard training underutilizes the diversity in data, and that ModC provides a simple, effective remedy for unlocking the full benefits of diversity in test-time scaling.

<title>Projection-Free CNN Pruning via Frank-Wolfe with Momentum: Sparser Models with Less Pretraining</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate algorithmic variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization method for pruning convolutional neural networks. This is motivated by the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.

<title>Dynamic Algorithm for Explainable k-medians Clustering under lp Norm</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01150</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of explainable k-medians clustering introduced by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020). In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets.

arXiv:2512.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Fiber Bundle Networks (FiberNet), a novel machine learning framework integrating differential geometry with machine learning. Unlike traditional deep neural networks relying on black-box function fitting, we reformulate classification as interpretable geometric optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers above each category. We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning.

<title>Open-Set Domain Adaptation Under Background Distribution Shift: Challenges and A Provably Efficient Solution</title>

arXiv:2512.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.

<title>From Regression to Classification: Exploring the Benefits of Categorical Representations of Energy in MLIPs</title>

arXiv:2512.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.
  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.

<title>2D-ThermAl: Physics-Informed Framework for Thermal Analysis of Circuits using Generative AI</title>

Abstract: Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71{\deg}C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85{\deg}C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55{\deg}C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95{\deg}C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control strategy for adaptive lighting regulation in controlled environments using a low-power microcontroller. A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.

Abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) promise broad generalisation capacity for Earth observation (EO) tasks, particularly under data-limited conditions. However, their large size poses a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained space hardware. To address this, we present compact variants of a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based GeoFM that preserve downstream task performance while enabling onboard execution. Evaluation across five downstream tasks and validation in two representative flight environments show that model compression and domain adaptation are critical to reducing size and resource demands while maintaining high performance under operational conditions. We further demonstrate reliable on-orbit inference with the IMAGIN-e payload aboard the International Space Station. These results establish a pathway from large GeoFMs to flight-ready, resource-efficient deployments, expanding the feasibility of onboard AI for EO missions.

Abstract: Transformer models often exhibit brittle extrapolation, failing on inputs that are longer or structurally more complex than those seen during training. We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics. We provide a detailed analysis of the counter-examples, showing how the curriculum naturally adapts to target progressively more complex error modes. Our findings establish verifier-guided, failure-driven learning as a simple, powerful, and efficient paradigm for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Transformer models.

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task across scientific domains. Existing methods fall broadly into two categories: autoregressive models, which iteratively expand graphs, and one-shot models, such as diffusion, which generate the full graph at once. In this work, we provide an analysis of these two paradigms and reveal a key trade-off: autoregressive models stand out in capturing fine-grained local structures, such as degree and clustering properties, whereas one-shot models excel at modeling global patterns, such as spectral distributions. Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail. This design captures both local and global properties with improved efficiency. Empirically, LGDC matches autoregressive models on locally structured datasets (Tree) and diffusion models on globally structured ones (Planar, Community-20), validating the benefits of hybrid generation.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of temperature field of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS) is crucial for thermal monitoring and reliability assessment in engineering applications such as electronic devices and aerospace structures. However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

Abstract: With the rapid advances in programmable materials, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have become a pivotal technology for future wireless communications. The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can both transmit and reflect signals, enabling comprehensive signal control and expanding application scenarios. This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms.

Abstract: In the context of intelligent manufacturing, this paper conducts a series of experimental studies on the predictive maintenance of industrial milling machine equipment based on the AI4I 2020 dataset. This paper proposes a complete predictive maintenance experimental process combining artificial intelligence technology, including six main links: data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model selection, SHAP analysis, and result visualization. By comparing and analyzing the performance of eight machine learning models, it is found that integrated learning methods such as XGBoost and random forest perform well in milling machine fault prediction tasks. In addition, with the help of SHAP analysis technology, the influence mechanism of different features on equipment failure is deeply revealed, among which processing temperature, torque and speed are the key factors affecting failure. This study combines artificial intelligence and manufacturing technology, provides a methodological reference for predictive maintenance practice in an intelligent manufacturing environment, and has practical significance for promoting the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry, improving production efficiency and reducing maintenance costs.

Abstract: Standard Transformers suffer from a "Semantic Alignment Tax", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates "Catastrophic Rigidity", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the "Plasticity-Stability" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of electricity markets, price volatility has significantly increased, making accurate forecasting crucial for power system operations and market decisions. Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240. To enhance interpretability, LIME analysis reveals that meteorological factors and supply-demand indicators significantly influence price fluctuations through nonlinear relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in electricity price forecasting while improving decision transparency through interpretability analysis.

<title>Neural Network Optimal Power Flow via Energy Gradient Flow and Unified Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.

Abstract: Answer verification methods are widely employed in language model training pipelines spanning data curation, evaluation, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While prior work focus on developing unified verifiers applicable across multiple reasoning scenarios, significant challenges remain in computation-oriented scientific domains, such as algebraic equivalence checking and physical constant substitution. In this paper, we introduce \model, a tool-augmented verifier that leverages external executors to perform precise computations and symbolic simplifications. \model enables robust verification that goes beyond simple semantic matching. We propose a novel two-stage pipeline, which begin with cold-start fine-tuning and followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning with tool integration. Extensive experiments conducted on STEM subjects, general QA, and long-form reasoning tasks demonstrates strong generalization of \model. The results shows that the \model achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerifyBench-Hard and SCI-Bench. And we also employ our \model in RLVR as a reward model, the results show that it consistently outperforms both rubric-based and model-based verifiers on AIME'24 and AIME'25, demonstrating strong potential to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLM. Our model is released at \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/Nanbeige/CoSineVerifier-Tool-4B}{https://huggingface.co/Nanbeige/CoSineVerifier-Tool-4B}.

<title>On the Tension Between Optimality and Adversarial Robustness in Policy Optimization</title>

arXiv:2512.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning has long been regarded as conflicting goals. Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance.

<title>Efficient Training of Diffusion Mixture-of-Experts Models: A Practical Recipe</title>

Abstract: Recent efforts on Diffusion Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have primarily focused on developing more sophisticated routing mechanisms. However, we observe that the underlying architectural configuration space remains markedly under-explored. Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters. All code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/yhlleo/EfficientMoE.

<title>Efficient Hyperparameter Search for Non-Stationary Model Training</title>

arXiv:2512.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning is the cornerstone of applications like recommendation and advertising systems, where models continuously adapt to shifting data distributions. Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.

<title>Accelerating Large-Scale Reasoning Model Inference with Sparse Self-Speculative Decoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01278</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.
  To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, offering faster sampling and simpler training by learning continuous flows governed by ordinary differential equations. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We introduce milearn, a Python package for multi-instance learning (MIL) that follows the familiar scikit-learn fit/predict interface while providing a unified framework for both classical and neural-network-based MIL algorithms for regression and classification.

We demonstrate the versatility of milearn across a broad range of synthetic MIL benchmark datasets, including digit classification and regression, molecular property prediction, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. Special emphasis is placed on the key instance detection (KID) problem, for which the package provides dedicated support.

<title>Intrinsic Structure as a Proxy for Saliency: SVD-Based Weight Preservation for Mixed-Precision Quantization in Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.
  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.

Abstract: Neural prediction offers a promising approach to forecasting the individual variability of neurocognitive functions and disorders and providing prognostic indicators for personalized invention. However, it is challenging to translate neural predictive models into medical artificial intelligent applications due to the limitations of domain shift and label scarcity. Here, we propose the directed evolution model (DEM), a novel computational model that mimics the trial-and-error processes of biological directed evolution to approximate optimal solutions for predictive modeling tasks. We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings. We conducted experiments on four different datasets for children with cochlear implants whose spoken language developmental outcomes vary considerably on the individual-child level. Preoperative neural MRI data has shown to accurately predict the post-operative outcome of these children within but not across datasets. Our results show that DEM can efficiently improve the performance of cross-domain pre-implantation neural predictions while addressing the challenge of label scarcity in target domain.

Abstract: Background: Impairment of visual spatial cognitive function is the most common early clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) uses the "0/1" binary method ("pass/fail") to evaluate the visual spatial cognitive ability represented by the Cube Copying Test(CCT), the elder with less formal education generally score 0 point, resulting in serious bias in the evaluation results. Therefore, this study proposes a fine evaluation method for CCT based on dynamic handwriting feature extraction of DH-SCSM-BLA. method : The Cogni-CareV3.0 software independently developed by our team was used to collect dynamic handwriting data of CCT. Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly. Conclusion: This study provides a relatively objective and comprehensive evaluation method for early screening and personalized intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment.

<title>Beyond Loss Guidance: Using PDE Residuals as Spectral Attention in Diffusion Neural Operators</title>

arXiv:2512.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) are often bottle-necked by slow gradient-based test-time optimization routines that use PDE residuals for loss guidance. They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines.

Abstract: Error Correction Codes (ECC) are fundamental to reliable digital communication, yet designing neural decoders that are both accurate and computationally efficient remains challenging. Recent denoising diffusion decoders with transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step. Across multiple decoding benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error rates (BER) than autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines, with notable improvements on longer codes, while delivering inference speeds up from 30x to 100x faster than denoising diffusion decoders.

Abstract: Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.

Abstract: Deep learning offers promising capabilities for the statistical downscaling of climate and weather forecasts, with generative approaches showing particular success in capturing fine-scale precipitation patterns. However, most existing models are region-specific, and their ability to generalize to unseen geographic areas remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate the generalization performance of generative downscaling models across diverse regions. Using a global framework, we employ ERA5 reanalysis data as predictors and IMERG precipitation estimates at $0.1^\circ$ resolution as targets. A hierarchical location-based data split enables a systematic assessment of model performance across 15 regions around the world.

<title>Fantastic Features and Where to Find Them: A Probing Method to combine Features from Multiple Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) trained with different objectives and data learn diverse representations, making some more effective than others for specific downstream tasks. Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models.

<title>A Self-explainable Model of Long Time Series by Extracting Informative Structured Causal Patterns</title>

Abstract: Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide variety of dynamical processes in science and engineering, yet obtaining their numerical solutions often requires high-resolution discretizations and repeated evaluations of complex operators, leading to substantial computational costs. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory. By connecting rigorous foundations with practical insight, this guide aims to establish a clear and reliable framework for applying FNOs effectively across diverse scientific and engineering fields.

<title>ZIP-RC: Zero-overhead Inference-time Prediction of Reward and Cost for Adaptive and Interpretable Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling multi-task capabilities without additional training. However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS.

Abstract: Water quality monitoring is a core component of ecological environmental protection. However, due to sensor failure or other inevitable factors, data missing often exists in long-term monitoring, posing great challenges in water quality analysis. This paper proposes a Neural Tucker Convolutional Network (NTCN) model for water quality data imputation, which features the following key components: a) Encode different mode entities into respective embedding vectors, and construct a Tucker interaction tensor by outer product operations to capture the complex mode-wise feature interactions; b) Use 3D convolution to extract fine-grained spatiotemporal features from the interaction tensor. Experiments on three real-world water quality datasets show that the proposed NTCN model outperforms several state-of-the-art imputation models in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: We investigate whether continuous-control policies can be represented and learned as discrete logic circuits instead of continuous neural networks. We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.

<title>Does Flatness imply Generalization for Logistic Loss in Univariate Two-Layer ReLU Network?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01473</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of generalization of arbitrarily overparameterized two-layer ReLU Neural Networks with univariate input. Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for constructing multi-view diffusion geometries through intertwined multi-view diffusion trajectories (MDTs), a class of inhomogeneous diffusion processes that iteratively combine the random walk operators of multiple data views. Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.

arXiv:2512.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents solutions to three machine learning challenges: compositional image retrieval, zero-shot anomaly detection, and backdoored model detection. In compositional image retrieval, we developed a system that processes visual and textual inputs to retrieve relevant images, achieving 95.38\% accuracy and ranking first with a clear margin over the second team. For zero-shot anomaly detection, we designed a model that identifies and localizes anomalies in images without prior exposure to abnormal examples, securing 1st place with 73.14\% accuracy. In the backdoored model detection task, we proposed a method to detect hidden backdoor triggers in neural networks, reaching an accuracy of 78\%, which placed our approach in second place. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in addressing key challenges related to retrieval, anomaly detection, and model security, with implications for real-world applications in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Code for all solutions is available online.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks provide a principled framework for uncertainty quantification by modeling the posterior distribution of network parameters. However, exact posterior inference is computationally intractable, and widely used approximations like the Laplace method struggle with scalability and posterior accuracy in modern deep networks. In this work, we revisit sampling techniques for posterior exploration, proposing a simple variation tailored to efficiently sample from the posterior in over-parameterized networks by leveraging the low-dimensional structure of loss minima. Building on this, we introduce a model that learns a deformation of the parameter space, enabling rapid posterior sampling without requiring iterative methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive posterior approximations with improved scalability compared to recent refinement techniques. These contributions provide a practical alternative for Bayesian inference in deep learning.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of natural language processing techniques has led to an unprecedented growth of text classifiers across the modern web. Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.
  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing.

Abstract: In this work, we consider learning-based applications in routing to solve a Vehicle Routing variant characterized by stochasticity and multiple objectives. Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time. Our results show that our model is capable of constructing a Pareto Front of good quality within acceptable run times compared to three baselines.

Abstract: Change-point detection (CPD) in high-dimensional, large-volume time series is challenging for statistical consistency, scalability, and interpretability. We introduce TimePred, a self-supervised framework that reduces multivariate CPD to univariate mean-shift detection by predicting each sample's normalized time index. This enables efficient offline CPD using existing algorithms and supports the integration of XAI attribution methods for feature-level explanations. Our experiments show competitive CPD performance while reducing computational cost by up to two orders of magnitude. In an industrial manufacturing case study, we demonstrate improved detection accuracy and illustrate the practical value of interpretable change-point insights.

<title>Do Large Language Models Walk Their Talk? Measuring the Gap Between Implicit Associations, Self-Report, and Behavioral Altruism</title>

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers in complex socio-technical systems. Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems.

Abstract: Legal AI systems powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face a critical accountability challenge: when an AI assistant cites case law, statutes, or contractual clauses, practitioners need verifiable guarantees that generated text faithfully represents source documents. Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

Abstract: Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.

Abstract: In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $\tau$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $\sigma^2$ to $\sigma^2/\tau$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.

<title>Automating modeling in mechanics: LLMs as designers of physics-constrained neural networks for constitutive modeling of materials</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agentic frameworks increasingly adopt the paradigm of dynamically generating task-specific agents. We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.

Abstract: A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.

Abstract: Despite advances in the use of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks, their ability to memorize information has raised privacy concerns. Therefore, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) during LLM training remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD. This means that our method did not degrade the model's utility while still maintaining strong privacy protection.

Abstract: Mofasa is an all-atom latent diffusion model with state-of-the-art performance for generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
  In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.
  To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: https://mofux.ai/ .

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the potential of weights to serve as effective representations, focusing on neural fields. Our key insight is that constraining the optimization space through a pre-trained base model and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can induce structure in weight space. Across reconstruction, generation, and analysis tasks on 2D and 3D data, we find that multiplicative LoRA weights achieve high representation quality while exhibiting distinctiveness and semantic structure. When used with latent diffusion models, multiplicative LoRA weights enable higher-quality generation than existing weight-space methods.

arXiv:2512.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last-layer retraining (LLR) methods -- wherein the last layer of a neural network is reinitialized and retrained on a held-out set following ERM training -- have garnered interest as an efficient approach to rectify dependence on spurious correlations and improve performance on minority groups. Surprisingly, LLR has been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we present strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that the success of LLR is primarily due to better group balance in the held-out set. We conclude by showing how the recent algorithms CB-LLR and AFR perform implicit group-balancing to elicit a robustness improvement.

<title>How Does RL Post-training Induce Skill Composition? A Case Study on Countdown</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) successfully enhances reasoning in large language models, its role in fostering compositional generalization (the ability to synthesize novel skills from known components) is often conflated with mere length generalization. To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal.

<title>Dual Randomized Smoothing: Beyond Global Noise Variance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01782</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01782</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a prominent technique for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models.

<title>The Active and Noise-Tolerant Strategic Perceptron</title>

Abstract: We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.
  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $\epsilon$ using only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ label queries and incurs at most $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].

<title>Forget Less, Retain More: A Lightweight Regularizer for Rehearsal-Based Continual Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diversity varies significantly across discrete latent generative models such as AR, MIM, and Diffusion. We propose a diagnostic framework, grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, to analyze the underlying strategies resolving this behavior. The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: "Diversity-Prioritized" (MIM), "Compression-Prioritized" (AR), and "Decoupled" (Diffusion). Our analysis provides a principled explanation for their behavioral differences and informs a novel inference-time diversity enhancement technique.

arXiv:2512.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.

arXiv:2512.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a "low-bit" exploration phase and a "high-precision" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.

Abstract: This work proposes an end-to-end multi-modal reinforcement learning framework for high-level decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The framework integrates heterogeneous sensory input, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and vehicle heading information, through a cross-attention transformer-based perception module. Although transformers have become the backbone of modern multi-modal architectures, their high computational cost limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. To overcome this challenge, we propose a spiking temporal-aware transformer-like architecture that uses ternary spiking neurons for computationally efficient multi-modal fusion. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks in the Highway Environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for real-time autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) require continual updates as new information emerges, but neural embedding models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237. Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes. While focused on a single embedding model and dataset, our results demonstrate that EWC effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in KG continual learning and highlight the importance of evaluation protocol design.

Abstract: Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired, event-driven models that are suitable for processing temporal data and offer energy-efficient computation when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient. Moreover, the results illustrate that the incorporation of delays may substantially improve performance in smaller networks.

Abstract: Natural climate solutions (NCS) offer an approach to mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, monitoring the carbon drawdown of ecosystems over large geographic areas remains challenging. Eddy-flux covariance towers provide ground truth for predictive 'upscaling' models derived from satellite products, but many satellites now produce measurements on spatial scales smaller than a flux tower's footprint. We introduce Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR), a first-of-its-kind, deep-learning framework that simultaneously predicts spatial footprints and pixel-level (30 m scale) estimates of carbon flux. FAR is trained on our AMERI-FAR25 dataset which combines 439 site years of tower data with corresponding Landsat scenes. Our model produces high-resolution predictions and achieves R2 = 0.78 when predicting monthly net ecosystem exchange on test sites from a variety of ecosystems.

Abstract: Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and its variants aim to speed-up training by using gradient corrections, but have seen limited success in deep learning. Here, we show surprising new foundational connections of SVRG to a recently proposed Bayesian method called posterior correction. Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponential families. We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models. This is the first work to connect SVRG to Bayes and use it to boost variational training for deep networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.

Abstract: Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant memory bottlenecks during inference due to the linear growth of key-value (KV) cache with sequence length. While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.

<title>Low-Rank Prehab: Preparing Neural Networks for SVD Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a "surgical" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as "rehab" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

<title>Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01983</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.

<title>Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

<title>AlignSAE: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode factual knowledge within hidden parametric spaces that are difficult to inspect or control. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a "pre-train, then post-train" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable "concept swaps", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.

<title>A Diffusion Model Framework for Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.

Abstract: Constant bit-size Transformers are known to be Turing complete, but existing constructions require $\Omega(s(n))$ chain-of-thought (CoT) steps per simulated Turing machine (TM) step, leading to impractical reasoning lengths. In this paper, we significantly reduce this efficiency gap by proving that any $(t(n),s(n))$-bounded multi-tape TM can be simulated by a constant bit-size Transformer with an optimal $O(s(n))$-long context window and only $O(s(n)^c)$ CoT steps per TM step, where $c>0$ can be made arbitrarily small by letting the Transformers' head-layer product sufficiently large. In addition, our construction shows that sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets suffices for efficient universal computation. Our proof leverages multi-queue TMs as a bridge. The main technical novelty is a more efficient simulation of multi-tape TMs by synchronous multi-queue TMs, improving both time and space complexity under stricter model assumptions.

Abstract: Talent search is a cornerstone of modern recruitment systems, yet existing approaches often struggle to capture nuanced job-specific preferences, model recruiter behavior at a fine-grained level, and mitigate noise from subjective human judgments. We present a novel framework that enhances talent search effectiveness and delivers substantial business value through two key innovations: (i) leveraging LLMs to extract fine-grained recruitment signals from job descriptions and historical hiring data, and (ii) employing a role-aware multi-gate MoE network to capture behavioral differences across recruiter roles. To further reduce noise, we introduce a multi-task learning module that jointly optimizes click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and resume matching relevance. Experiments on real-world recruitment data and online A/B testing show relative AUC gains of 1.70% (CTR) and 5.97% (CVR), and a 17.29% lift in click-through conversion rate. These improvements reduce dependence on external sourcing channels, enabling an estimated annual cost saving of millions of CNY.

Abstract: The ever increasing complexity of the hardware design process demands improved hardware design and verification methodologies. With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work.

Abstract: Accurate setup/hold time characterization is crucial for modern chip timing closure, but its reliance on potentially millions of SPICE simulations across diverse process-voltagetemperature (PVT) corners creates a major bottleneck, often lasting weeks or months. Existing methods suffer from slow search convergence and inefficient exploration, especially in the multi-corner setting. We introduce SetupKit, a novel framework designed to break this bottleneck using statistical intelligence, circuit analysis and active learning (AL). SetupKit integrates three key innovations: BEIRA, a bias-enhanced interpolation search derived from statistical error modeling to accelerate convergence by overcoming stagnation issues, initial search interval estimation by circuit analysis and AL strategy using Gaussian Process. This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multicorner characterization. Evaluated on industrial 22nm standard cells across 16 PVT corners, SetupKit demonstrates a significant 2.4x overall CPU time reduction (from 720 to 290 days on a single core) compared to standard practices, drastically cutting characterization time. SetupKit offers a principled, learningbased approach to library characterization, addressing a critical EDA challenge and paving the way for more intelligent simulation management.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) continue to grow in complexity with Large Language Models (LLMs) incorporating vast numbers of parameters. Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage. For example, with 4096 MAC units, SafeCiM reduces accuracy degradation by up to 49x for a single adder fault compared to the baseline FP-CiM architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic policy learning have enabled complex manipulation in real-world environments, yet the execution speed of these policies often lags behind hardware capabilities due to the cost of collecting faster demonstrations. Existing works on policy acceleration reinterpret action sequence for unseen execution speed, thereby encountering distributional shifts from the original demonstrations. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that adapts policies for faster execution without additional demonstration, but its unguided exploration is sample inefficient. We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate.

Abstract: We propose a technique to assist in converting a reference layout of an analog circuit into the procedural layout generator by efficiently reusing available generators for sub-cell creation. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model automatically detects sub-cells that can be generated by available generator scripts in the library, and suggests using them in the hierarchically correct places of the generator software. In experiments, the CNN model examined sub-cells of a high-speed wireline receiver that has a total of 4,885 sub-cell instances including different 145 sub-cell designs. The CNN model classified the sub-cell instances into 51 generatable and one not-generatable classes. One not-generatable class indicates that no available generator can generate the classified sub-cell. The CNN model achieved 99.3% precision in examining the 145 different sub-cell designs. The CNN model greatly reduced the examination time to 18 seconds from 88 minutes required in manual examination. Also, the proposed CNN model could correctly classify unfamiliar sub-cells that are very different from the training dataset.

Abstract: Automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) is a crucial process in integrated circuit (IC) design and testing, responsible for efficiently generating test patterns. As semiconductor technology progresses, traditional ATPG struggles with long execution times to achieve the expected fault coverage, which impacts the time-to-market of chips. Recent machine learning techniques, like reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs), show promise but face issues such as reward delay in RL models and inadequate circuit representation in GNN-based methods. In this paper, we propose InF-ATPG, an intelligent FFR-driven ATPG framework that overcomes these challenges by using advanced circuit representation to guide RL. By partitioning circuits into fanout-free regions (FFRs) and incorporating ATPG-specific features into a novel QGNN architecture, InF-ATPG enhances test pattern generation efficiency. Experimental results show InF-ATPG reduces backtracks by 55.06\% on average compared to traditional methods and 38.31\% compared to the machine learning approach, while also improving fault coverage.

Abstract: In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

Abstract: We propose SemImage, a novel method for representing a text document as a two-dimensional semantic image to be processed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.

Abstract: As COVID-19 transitions into an endemic disease that remains constantly present in the population at a stable level, monitoring its prevalence without invasive measures becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present a deep neural network estimator for the COVID-19 daily case count based on wastewater surveillance data and other confounding factors. This work builds upon the study by Jiang, Kolozsvary, and Li (2024), which connects the COVID-19 case counts with testing data collected early in the pandemic. Using the COVID-19 testing data and the wastewater surveillance data during the period when both data were highly reliable, one can train an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear relation between the COVID-19 daily case count and the wastewater viral RNA concentration. From a machine learning perspective, the main challenge lies in addressing temporal feature reliability, as the training data has different reliability over different time periods.

Abstract: This work examines how three different image-based methods, VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny, perform in identifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls using daily actigraphy records. Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.

Abstract: With the rise of AI-generated content (AIGC), generating perceptually natural and feeling-aligned music from multimodal inputs has become a central challenge. Existing approaches often rely on explicit emotion labels that require costly annotation, underscoring the need for more flexible feeling-aligned methods. To support multimodal music generation, we construct ArtiCaps, a pseudo feeling-aligned image-music-text dataset created by semantically matching descriptions from ArtEmis and MusicCaps. We further propose Art2Music, a lightweight cross-modal framework that synthesizes music from artistic images and user comments. In the first stage, images and text are encoded with OpenCLIP and fused using a gated residual module; the fused representation is decoded by a bidirectional LSTM into Mel-spectrograms with a frequency-weighted L1 loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. In the second stage, a fine-tuned HiFi-GAN vocoder reconstructs high-quality audio waveforms. Experiments on ArtiCaps show clear improvements in Mel-Cepstral Distortion, Frechet Audio Distance, Log-Spectral Distance, and cosine similarity. A small LLM-based rating study further verifies consistent cross-modal feeling alignment and offers interpretable explanations of matches and mismatches across modalities. These results demonstrate improved perceptual naturalness, spectral fidelity, and semantic consistency. Art2Music also maintains robust performance with only 50k training samples, providing a scalable solution for feeling-aligned creative audio generation in interactive art, personalized soundscapes, and digital art exhibitions.

<title>Hybrid Synthetic Data Generation with Domain Randomization Enables Zero-Shot Vision-Based Part Inspection Under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is transforming industrial quality inspection. Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.

Abstract: Identifying causal effects in the presence of unmeasured variables is a fundamental challenge in causal inference, for which proxy variable methods have emerged as a powerful solution. We contrast two major approaches in this framework: (1) bridge equation methods, which leverage solutions to integral equations to recover causal targets, and (2) array decomposition methods, which recover latent factors composing counterfactual quantities by exploiting unique determination of eigenspaces. We compare the model restrictions underlying these two approaches and provide insight into implications of the underlying assumptions, clarifying the scope of applicability for each method.

<title>Efficient Edge-Compatible CNN for Speckle-Based Material Recognition in Laser Cutting Systems</title>

Abstract: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe and effective laser cutting, as misidentification can lead to poor cut quality, machine damage, or the release of hazardous fumes. Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

Abstract: Our goal is to consolidate the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.

<title>AutocleanEEG ICVision: Automated ICA Artifact Classification Using Vision-Language AI</title>

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Abstract: Expected goals (xG) models estimate the probability that a shot results in a goal from its context (e.g., location, pressure), but they operate only on observed shots. We propose xG+, a possession-level framework that first estimates the probability that a shot occurs within the next second and its corresponding xG if it were to occur. We also introduce ways to aggregate this joint probability estimate over the course of a possession. By jointly modeling shot-taking behavior and shot quality, xG+ remedies the conditioning-on-shots limitation of standard xG. We show that this improves predictive accuracy at the team level and produces a more persistent player skill signal than standard xG models.

<title>Tree Matching Networks for Natural Language Inference: Parameter-Efficient Semantic Understanding via Dependency Parse Trees</title>

Abstract: In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.

<title>Statistical Inference under Adaptive Sampling with LinUCB</title>

Abstract: Adaptively collected data has become ubiquitous within modern practice. However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets. Numerical simulations corroborate our findings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: Purpose: To benchmark open-source or commercial medical image-specific VLMs against real-world radiologist-written reports. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who presented to the emergency department between January 2022 and April 2025 and underwent same-day CXR and CT for febrile or respiratory symptoms. Reports from five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, and MedVersa) and radiologist-written reports were randomly presented and blindly evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination, and language clarity. Comparative performance was assessed using generalized linear mixed models, with radiologist-written reports treated as the reference. Finding-level analyses were also performed with CT as the reference. Results: A total of 478 patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 50-78]; 282 men [59.0%]) were included. AIRead demonstrated the lowest RADPEER 3b rate (5.3% [76/1434] vs. radiologists 13.9% [200/1434]; P<.001), whereas other VLMs showed higher disagreement rates (16.8-43.0%; P<.05). Clinical acceptability was the highest with AIRead (84.5% [1212/1434] vs. radiologists 74.3% [1065/1434]; P<.001), while other VLMs performed worse (41.1-71.4%; P<.05). Hallucinations were rare with AIRead, comparable to radiologists (0.3% [4/1425]) vs. 0.1% [1/1425]; P=.21), but frequent with other models (5.4-17.4%; P<.05). Language clarity was higher with AIRead (82.9% [1189/1434]), Lingshu (88.0% [1262/1434]), and MedVersa (88.4% [1268/1434]) compared with radiologists (78.1% [1120/1434]; P<.05). Sensitivity varied substantially across VLMs for the common findings: AIRead, 15.5-86.7%; Lingshu, 2.4-86.7%; MAIRA-2, 6.0-72.0%; MedGemma, 4.8-76.7%; and MedVersa, 20.2-69.3%. Conclusion: Medical VLMs for CXR report generation exhibited variable performance in report quality and diagnostic measures.

<title>Stochastic Dominance Constrained Optimization with S-shaped Utilities: Poor-Performance-Region Algorithm and Neural Network</title>

Abstract: We investigate the static portfolio selection problem of S-shaped and non-concave utility maximization under first-order and second-order stochastic dominance (SD) constraints. In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses. In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.

<title>RL-Struct: A Lightweight Reinforcement Learning Framework for Reliable Structured Output in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning. However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the "Structure Gap" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to "hallucinated" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of training dynamics, revealing a distinct self-paced curriculum where the model sequentially acquires syntactic proficiency before semantic accuracy. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Freakz3z/Qwen-JSON.

The model conditions the denoising process on semantic priors extracted by a Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) backbone, yielding a semantically guided and lightweight diffusion architecture. This design improves robustness while reducing both inference time and VRAM usage compared to conventional diffusion models. Experiments on multi-organ, multi-modality datasets demonstrate that MedCondDiff delivers competitive performance across anatomical regions and imaging modalities, underscoring the potential of semantically guided diffusion models as an effective class of architectures for medical imaging tasks.

<title>An Interpretable Operator-Learning Model for Electric Field Profile Reconstruction in Discharges Based on the EFISH Method</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have recently been used to reconstruct electric field distributions from EFISH signal profiles-the 'inverse EFISH problem'. This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) programming capabilities enable their participation in open-source games: a game-theoretic setting in which players submit computer programs in lieu of actions. These programs offer numerous advantages, including interpretability, inter-agent transparency, and formal verifiability; additionally, they enable program equilibria, solutions that leverage the transparency of code and are inaccessible within normal-form settings. We evaluate the capabilities of leading open- and closed-weight LLMs to predict and classify program strategies and evaluate features of the approximate program equilibria reached by LLM agents in dyadic and evolutionary settings. We identify the emergence of payoff-maximizing, cooperative, and deceptive strategies, characterize the adaptation of mechanisms within these programs over repeated open-source games, and analyze their comparative evolutionary fitness. We find that open-source games serve as a viable environment to study and steer the emergence of cooperative strategy in multi-agent dilemmas.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based protein analysis, yet most applications rely only on final-layer embeddings, which may overlook biologically meaningful information encoded in earlier layers. We systematically evaluate all 33 layers of ESM-2 for kinase functional prediction using both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. We show that mid-to-late transformer layers (layers 20-33) outperform the final layer by 32 percent in unsupervised Adjusted Rand Index and improve homology-aware supervised accuracy to 75.7 percent. Domain-level extraction, calibrated probability estimates, and a reproducible benchmarking pipeline further strengthen reliability. Our results demonstrate that transformer depth contains functionally distinct biological signals and that principled layer selection significantly improves kinase function prediction.

Abstract: We establish a precise mathematical equivalence between witness-based similarity systems (REWA) and Shannon's information theory. We prove that witness overlap is mutual information, that REWA bit complexity bounds arise from channel capacity limitations, and that ranking-preserving encodings obey rate-distortion constraints. This unification reveals that fifty years of similarity search research -- from Bloom filters to locality-sensitive hashing to neural retrieval -- implicitly developed information theory for relational data. We derive fundamental lower bounds showing that REWA's $O(\Delta^{-2} \log N)$ complexity is optimal: no encoding scheme can preserve similarity rankings with fewer bits. The framework establishes that semantic similarity has physical units (bits of mutual information), search is communication (query transmission over a noisy channel), and retrieval systems face fundamental capacity limits analogous to Shannon's channel coding theorem.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for drug discovery, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology applications. Current computational approaches face limitations in capturing complex enzyme-substrate interactions and often focus on single parameters while neglecting the joint prediction of catalytic turnover numbers (Kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km). We present EnzyCLIP, a novel dual-encoder framework that leverages contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to predict enzyme kinetic parameters from protein sequences and substrate molecular structures. Our approach integrates ESM-2 protein language model embeddings with ChemBERTa chemical representations through a CLIP-inspired architecture enhanced with bidirectional cross-attention for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling. EnzyCLIP combines InfoNCE contrastive loss with Huber regression loss to learn aligned multimodal representations while predicting log10-transformed kinetic parameters. The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction. XGBoost ensemble methods applied to the learned embeddings further improved Km prediction (R2 = 0.61) while maintaining robust Kcat performance.

Abstract: Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are among the most effective algorithms for supervised learning on tabular data. Both belong to the class of tree-based ensemble methods, where predictions are obtained by aggregating many randomized regression trees. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing such methods through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) constructed on tree ensembles -- more precisely, on the random partitions generated by randomized regression trees. We establish fundamental analytical properties of the resulting Random Forest kernel, including boundedness, continuity, and universality, and show that a Random Forest predictor can be characterized as the unique minimizer of a penalized empirical risk functional in this RKHS, providing a variational interpretation of ensemble learning. We further extend this perspective to the continuous-time formulation of Gradient Boosting introduced by Dombry and Duchamps, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a gradient flow on a Hilbert manifold induced by the Random Forest RKHS. A key feature of this framework is that both the kernel and the RKHS geometry are data-dependent, offering a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of tree-based ensembles. Finally, we illustrate the practical potential of this approach by introducing a kernel principal component analysis built on the Random Forest kernel, which enhances the interpretability of ensemble models, as well as GVI, a new geometric variable importance criterion.

Abstract: Building design directly affects human well-being and carbon emissions, yet generating spatial-functional and energy-compliant floorplans remains manual, costly, and non-scalable. Existing methods produce visually plausible layouts but frequently violate key constraints, yielding invalid results due to the absence of automated evaluation. We present GreenPlanner, an energy- and functionality-aware generative framework that unifies design evaluation and generation. It consists of a labeled Design Feasibility Dataset for learning constraint priors; a fast Practical Design Evaluator (PDE) for predicting energy performance and spatial-functional validity; a Green Plan Dataset (GreenPD) derived from PDE-guided filtering to pair user requirements with regulation-compliant layouts; and a GreenFlow generator trained on GreenPD with PDE feedback for controllable, regulation-aware generation. Experiments show that GreenPlanner accelerates evaluation by over $10^{5}\times$ with $>$99% accuracy, eliminates invalid samples, and boosts design efficiency by 87% over professional architects.

Abstract: Due to the progress in artificial intelligence, it is important to understand how capable artificial agents should be used when interacting with humans, since high level authority and responsibility often remain with the human agent. However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence. At the core of this design space lies joint agent engineering with the goal of integrating the design subspaces operator training, artificial intelligence engineering, and interface design via developing joint agent patterns. The ''extended swarming'' approach to human-swarm interaction is discussed as an example of such a pattern.

<title>RECTor: Robust and Efficient Correlation Attack on Tor</title>

Abstract: Tor is a widely used anonymity network that conceals user identities by routing traffic through encrypted relays, yet it remains vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks that deanonymize users by matching patterns in ingress and egress traffic. However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and highlight the need for advanced model-aware defenses.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has attracted increasing attention by integrating educational psychology with deep learning technologies. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.

Abstract: Active imitation learning (AIL) combats covariate shift by querying an expert during training. However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-\alpha)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $\alpha$ to the expected query rate and makes $\alpha$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $\alpha$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics is emerging as an increasingly important field of research for large-scale intelligent building control. However, research in data-driven modeling using machine learning (ML) techniques requires massive amounts of thermal building data, which is not easily available. Neither empirical public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of ML research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. To fill this gap, we present a thermal building data generation framework which we call BuilDa. BuilDa is designed to produce synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for ML research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for a transfer learning study involving the fine-tuning of 486 data-driven models.

Abstract: Sequential optimization of black-box functions from noisy evaluations has been widely studied, with Gaussian Process bandit algorithms such as GP-UCB guaranteeing no-regret in stationary settings. However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.
  In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust precoder design for resilient cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems that minimizes the weighted sum of desired signal mean square error (MSE) and residual interference leakage power under a total transmit power constraint. The proposed robust precoder incorporates channel state information (CSI) error statistics to enhance resilience against CSI imperfections. We employ an alternating optimization algorithm initialized with a minimum MSE-type solution, which iteratively refines the precoder while maintaining low computational complexity and ensuring fast convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional linear precoders, providing an effective balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Respiratory diseases remain major global health challenges, and traditional auscultation is often limited by subjectivity, environmental noise, and inter-clinician variability. This study presents an explainable multimodal deep learning framework for automatic lung-disease detection using respiratory audio signals. The proposed system integrates two complementary representations: a spectral-temporal encoder based on a CNN-BiLSTM Attention architecture, and a handcrafted acoustic-feature encoder capturing physiologically meaningful descriptors such as MFCCs, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, and zero-crossing rate. These branches are combined through late-stage fusion to leverage both data-driven learning and domain-informed acoustic cues. The model is trained and evaluated on the Asthma Detection Dataset Version 2 using rigorous preprocessing, including resampling, normalization, noise filtering, data augmentation, and patient-level stratified partitioning. The study achieved strong generalization with 91.21% accuracy, 0.899 macro F1-score, and 0.9866 macro ROC-AUC, outperforming all ablated variants. An ablation study confirms the importance of temporal modeling, attention mechanisms, and multimodal fusion. The framework incorporates Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, and SHAP, generating interpretable spectral, temporal, and feature-level explanations aligned with known acoustic biomarkers to build clinical transparency. The findings demonstrate the framework's potential for telemedicine, point-of-care diagnostics, and real-world respiratory screening.

Abstract: Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) is a popular method for non-algorithmic estimation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) model was proposed by researchers, however, no optimal approach for reliable estimation was developed. Achieving high accuracy in the ABE might be challenging for new software projects that differ from previous initiatives. This study (conducted in June 2024) proposes a Firefly Algorithm-guided Analogy-Based Estimation (FAABE) model that combines FA with ABE to improve estimation accuracy. The FAABE model was tested on five publicly accessible datasets: Cocomo81, Desharnais, China, Albrecht, Kemerer and Maxwell. To improve prediction efficiency, feature selection was used. The results were measured using a variety of evaluation metrics; various error measures include MMRE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Compared to conventional models, the experimental results show notable increases in prediction precision, demonstrating the efficacy of the Firefly-Analogy ensemble.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Motor Execution (ME) and Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer a direct pathway for human-machine interaction. However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate the existence of a statistical-computational gap in multiple Gaussian graph alignment. We first generalize a previously established informational threshold from Vassaux and Massouli\'e (2025) to regimes where the number of observed graphs $p$ may also grow with the number of nodes $n$: when $p \leq O(n/\log(n))$, we recover the results from Vassaux and Massouli\'e (2025), and $p \geq \Omega(n/\log(n))$ corresponds to a regime where the problem is as difficult as aligning one single graph with some unknown "signal" graph. Moreover, when $\log p = \omega(\log n)$, the informational thresholds for partial and exact recovery no longer coincide, in contrast to the all-or-nothing phenomenon observed when $\log p=O(\log n)$. Then, we provide the first computational barrier in the low-degree framework for (multiple) Gaussian graph alignment. We prove that when the correlation $\rho$ is less than $1$, up to logarithmic terms, low degree non-trivial estimation fails. Our results suggest that the task of aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as hard as the problem of aligning two graphs in polynomial time, up to logarithmic factors. These results characterize the existence of a statistical-computational gap and provide another example in which polynomial-time algorithms cannot handle complex combinatorial bi-dimensional structures.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.

<title>Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Reproducibility Crisis</title>

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet its state in large language model (LLM)-based software engineering (SE) research remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor.

<title>Self-sufficient Independent Component Analysis via KL Minimizing Flows</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning disentangled signals from data using non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning, we propose to learn self-sufficient signals: A recovered signal should be able to reconstruct a missing value of its own from all remaining components without relying on any other signals. We formulate this problem as the minimization of a conditional KL divergence. Compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation, our algorithm is prior-free and likelihood-free, meaning that we do not need to impose any prior on the original signals or any observational model, which often restricts the model's flexibility. To tackle the KL divergence minimization problem, we propose a sequential algorithm that reduces the KL divergence and learns an optimal de-mixing flow model at each iteration. This approach completely avoids the unstable adversarial training, a common issue in minimizing the KL divergence. Experiments on toy and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We study a structured permutation scheme for two-sample testing that restricts permutations to single cross-swaps between block-selected representatives. Our analysis yields three main results. First, we provide an exact validity construction that applies to any fixed restricted permutation set. Second, for both the difference of sample means and the unbiased $\widehat{\mathrm{MMD}}^{2}$ estimator, we derive closed-form one-swap increment identities whose conditional variances scale as $O(h^{2})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(h)$ increment variability under full relabeling. This increment-level variance contraction sharpens the Bernstein--Freedman variance proxy and leads to substantially smaller permutation critical values. Third, we obtain explicit, data-dependent expressions for the resulting critical values and statistical power. Together, these results show that block-restricted one-swap permutations can achieve strictly higher power than classical full permutation tests while maintaining exact finite-sample validity, without relying on pessimistic worst-case Lipschitz bounds.

<title>Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Using Non-Von Neumann Computers</title>

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix decomposition problem with applications in unsupervised learning. The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage.

Abstract: Isolated digit classification has served as a motivating problem for decades of machine learning research. In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.

<title>Fragmentation is Efficiently Learnable by Quantum Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is a phenomenon in which the Hilbert space of a quantum system is dynamically decoupled into exponentially many Krylov subspaces. We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.

<title>FC-ADL: Efficient Microservice Anomaly Detection and Localisation Through Functional Connectivity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Microservices have transformed software architecture through the creation of modular and independent services. However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to Alibaba's extremely large real-world microservice deployment.

<title>One Swallow Does Not Make a Summer: Understanding Semantic Structures in Embedding Spaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding spaces are fundamental to modern AI, translating raw data into high-dimensional vectors that encode rich semantic relationships. Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces.

Abstract: Image clustering is a classic problem in computer vision, which categorizes images into different groups. Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art training-free approach with a 4.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of 12 foraminifera species using 2D micro-CT slices derived from 3D scans. We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning. To ensure methodological integrity and prevent data leakage, we employed specimen-level data splitting, resulting in 109,617 high-quality 2D slices (44,103 for training, 14,046 for validation, and 51,468 for testing). We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient. This work establishes new benchmarks for AI-assisted micropaleontological identification and provides a fully reproducible framework for foraminifera classification research, bridging the gap between deep learning and applied geosciences.

<title>Outcome-Aware Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. An established approach is to use estimators based on learned spectral features, that is, features spanning the top singular subspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. While powerful, such features are agnostic to the outcome variable. Consequently, the method can fail when the true causal function is poorly represented by these dominant singular functions. To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware. Our method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that incorporates information from the outcome. By learning these task-specific features, our approach remains effective even under spectral misalignment. We provide a theoretical analysis of this framework and validate our approach on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: We study the multi-objective linear contextual bandit problem, where multiple possible conflicting objectives must be optimized simultaneously. We propose \texttt{MOL-TS}, the \textit{first} Thompson Sampling algorithm with Pareto regret guarantees for this problem. Unlike standard approaches that compute an empirical Pareto front each round, \texttt{MOL-TS} samples parameters across objectives and efficiently selects an arm from a novel \emph{effective Pareto front}, which accounts for repeated selections over time. Our analysis shows that \texttt{MOL-TS} achieves a worst-case Pareto regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature vectors, $T$ is the total number of rounds, matching the best known order for randomized linear bandit algorithms for single objective. Empirical results confirm the benefits of our proposed approach, demonstrating improved regret minimization and strong multi-objective performance.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.
  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.
  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the "what," "how," and "why" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Indirect prompt injection attacks (IPIAs), where large language models (LLMs) follow malicious instructions hidden in input data, pose a critical threat to LLM-powered agents. In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three "thinking intervention" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).

Abstract: A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning. We release our codes, models and data at https://github.com/HHYHRHY/MM-ACT.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means constitute fundamental techniques in multivariate analysis. Although they are frequently applied independently or sequentially to cluster observations, the relationship between them, especially when K-means is used to cluster variables rather than observations, has been scarcely explored. This study seeks to address this gap by proposing an innovative method that analyzes the relationship between clusters of variables obtained by applying K-means on transposed data and the principal components of PCA. Our approach involves applying PCA to the original data and K-means to the transposed data set, where the original variables are converted into observations. The contribution of each variable cluster to each principal component is then quantified using measures based on variable loadings. This process provides a tool to explore and understand the clustering of variables and how such clusters contribute to the principal dimensions of variation identified by PCA.

Abstract: Objectives: We present and evaluate a Mamba-based deep-learning model for diagnosis and event-level characterization of sleep disordered breathing based on signals from the ANNE One, a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography, triaxial accelerometry, chest and finger temperature, and finger phototplethysmography.
  Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.
  Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.
  Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.

Abstract: Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

Abstract: Inference over large-scale foundation models within heterogeneous edge environments necessitates a fundamentally reconfigurable orchestration substrate. Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.

<title>Shielded Controller Units for RL with Operational Constraints Applied to Remote Microgrids</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimizing decision-making in complex systems under uncertainty, an essential challenge in real-world settings, particularly in the context of the energy transition. A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition.

Abstract: Logical specifications have been shown to help reinforcement learning algorithms in achieving complex tasks. However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.

<title>The Silence that Speaks: Neural Estimation via Communication Gaps</title>

Abstract: Accurate remote state estimation is a fundamental component of many autonomous and networked dynamical systems, where multiple decision-making agents interact and communicate over shared, bandwidth-constrained channels. These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy.

<title>Parameter Reduction Improves Vision Transformers: A Comparative Study of Sharing and Width Reduction</title>

Abstract: Although scaling laws and many empirical results suggest that increasing the size of Vision Transformers often improves performance, model accuracy and training behavior are not always monotonically increasing with scale. Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

<title>On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT</title>

Abstract: Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.

Abstract: Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed "AI/ML". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.

<title>Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.

Abstract: We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

Abstract: We introduce Smart Bayes, a new classification framework that bridges generative and discriminative modeling by integrating likelihood-ratio-based generative features into a logistic-regression-style discriminative classifier. From the generative perspective, Smart Bayes relaxes the fixed unit weights of Naive Bayes by allowing data-driven coefficients on density-ratio features. From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates. To support this framework, we develop a spline-based estimator for univariate log-density ratios that is flexible, robust, and computationally efficient. Through extensive simulations and real-data studies, Smart Bayes often outperforms both logistic regression and Naive Bayes. Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that exploit generative structure to enhance discriminative performance.

Abstract: Developers routinely work with source files whose variable names are generic or misleading, and with teams moving quickly, many functions are left undocumented. This slows comprehension, increases the risk of subtle bugs, and makes it harder for both humans and large language models (LLMs) to reason about code. We study variable name repair: given a real C++ function where all occurrences of one local or parameter name have been replaced by a placeholder (e.g. ID 1), the goal is to generate a natural, descriptive replacement name. We automatically construct this task from the C++ portion of BigCode's The Stack by parsing functions with Tree-sitter, masking a single identifier, and treating the original name as supervision. On top of Llama 3.1-8B, we build a pipeline with (i) warmup and dropout schedules for more stable fine-tuning, (ii) LoRA adapters for efficient specialization on identifier repair, and (iii) a dual-encoder reranker over top-k generator candidates. We evaluate using exact match, Top-5 Hit, and an embedding-based partial similarity score (0-100) that gives credit for near synonyms and format variants (e.g., jsonValue vs. json). On a held-out set of 200 C++ functions, a zero-shot Llama 3.1 baseline reaches 6.1 percent exact match. Our best LoRA-tuned model (with warmup and dropout) achieves 43.1 percent exact match, 50.2 percent Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score. A dual encoder reranker further improves selection quality without modifying the underlying generator, suggesting that task-specific fine-tuning plus reranking is a promising approach for practical identifier repair tools.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments presents a challenging optimization problem characterized by extreme cost asymmetry, where missed failures incur costs roughly fifty times higher than false alarms. Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.

<title>DPAC: Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control for Diffusion Sampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O({\Delta}t) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O({\Delta}t^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Abstract: Conversion and conversion rate (CVR) prediction play a critical role in efficient advertising decision-making. In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future. This review is expected to provide valuable references and insights for future researchers and practitioners in this area.

Abstract: Mean-field games (MFGs) study the Nash equilibrium of systems with a continuum of interacting agents, which can be formulated as the fixed-point of optimal control problems. They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.

Abstract: This research designs a unified architecture of CTR prediction benchmark (Bench-CTR) platform that offers flexible interfaces with datasets and components of a wide range of CTR prediction models. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive system of evaluation protocols encompassing real-world and synthetic datasets, a taxonomy of metrics, standardized procedures and experimental guidelines for calibrating the performance of CTR prediction models. Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

Abstract: A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain responds to external stimuli and decoding this process has been a significant challenge in neuroscience. While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \{brain, speech, gesture\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate a neural network model in which weights between computational nodes are modified according to a local learning rule. To determine whether local learning rules are sufficient for learning, we encode the network architectures and learning dynamics genetically and then apply selection pressure to evolve networks capable of learning the four boolean functions of one variable. The successful networks are analysed and we show how learning behaviour emerges as a distributed property of the entire network. Finally the utility of genetic algorithms as a tool of discovery is discussed.

<title>Closing the Approximation Gap of Partial AUC Optimization: A Tale of Two Formulations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01213</link>

Abstract: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(\epsilon^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $\alpha$/$\beta$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(\alpha^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + \beta^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

<title>Implicitly Normalized Online PCA: A Regularized Algorithm with Exact High-Dimensional Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Many online learning algorithms, including classical online PCA methods, enforce explicit normalization steps that discard the evolving norm of the parameter vector. We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms.

<title>Bayesian Optimization for Non-Cooperative Game-Based Radio Resource Management</title>

Abstract: Radio resource management in modern cellular networks often calls for the optimization of complex utility functions that are potentially conflicting between different base stations (BSs). Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.

Abstract: Traditional data sources on bushfire evacuation behaviour, such as quantitative surveys and manual observations have severe limitations. Mining social media data related to bushfire evacuations promises to close this gap by allowing the collection and processing of a large amount of behavioural data, which are low-cost, accurate, possibly including location information and rich contextual information. However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness. We identify open problems such as data quality, bias and representativeness, geolocation accuracy, contextual understanding, crisis-specific lexicon and semantics, and multimodal data interpretation.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence. The dataset of the benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZehuaZhao/SUPERChem.

Abstract: The standard definition of PAC learning (Valiant 1984) requires learners to succeed under all distributions -- even ones that are intractable to sample from. This stands in contrast to samplable PAC learning (Blum, Furst, Kearns, and Lipton 1993), where learners only have to succeed under samplable distributions. We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners.
  We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from.
  Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded.

<title>Experimental Methods, Health Indicators, and Diagnostic Strategies for Retired Lithium-ion Batteries: A Comprehensive Review</title>

Abstract: Reliable health assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries is essential for safe and economically viable second-life deployment, yet remains difficult due to sparse measurements, incomplete historical records, heterogeneous chemistries, and limited or noisy battery health labels. Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden. Looking forward, progress toward physically constrained generative models, cross-chemistry generalization, calibrated uncertainty estimation, and standardized benchmarks will be crucial for building reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready health prediction tools tailored to the realities of retired-battery applications.

Abstract: Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn. The code is available at https://github.com/modelscope/AgentEvolver/research/CuES.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding generates high-quality translations by maximizing the expected utility of output candidates, but it evaluates all pairwise scores over the candidate set; hence, it takes quadratic time with respect to the number of candidates. To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks.

Abstract: The Never Give Up (NGU) algorithm has proven effective in reinforcement learning tasks with sparse rewards by combining episodic novelty and intrinsic motivation. In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

<title>The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness</title>

Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

Abstract: This paper presents a modality-augmented fine-tuning framework designed to adapt foundation robot policies to diverse humanoid embodiments. We validate our approach across two distinct settings: (i) the GR1 embodiment, utilizing public datasets where we introduce post-processed modalities, including binary contact signals and ZoeDepth-generated metric depth; and (ii) the Unitree G1 embodiment, for which we contribute a novel multi-modal dataset incorporating cuRobo motion planning, inverse kinematics, and ground-truth contact-force measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 "Pick Apple to Bowl" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1. Consequently, this work establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning.

Abstract: The generation of realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in simulation is essential for developing and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most simulation frameworks rely on rule-based or simplified models for scene generation, which lack the fidelity and diversity needed to represent real-world driving. While recent advances in generative modeling produce more realistic and context-aware traffic interactions, they often overlook how social preferences influence driving behavior. SocialDriveGen addresses this gap through a hierarchical framework that integrates semantic reasoning and social preference modeling with generative trajectory synthesis. By modeling egoism and altruism as complementary social dimensions, our framework enables controllable diversity in driver personalities and interaction styles. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset show that SocialDriveGen generates diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios spanning cooperative to adversarial behaviors, significantly enhancing policy robustness and generalization to rare or high-risk situations.

Abstract: Network traffic anomaly detection is a critical cy- bersecurity challenge requiring robust solutions for complex Internet of Things (IoT) environments. We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework integrating an enhanced Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with the Quantum Haar Wavelet Packet Transform (QWPT) for superior anomaly classification under realistic noisy intermediate-scale Quantum conditions. Our methodology employs amplitude-encoded quan- tum state preparation, multi-level QWPT feature extraction, and behavioral analysis via Shannon Entropy profiling and Chi-square testing. Features are classified using QSVM with fidelity-based quantum kernels optimized through hybrid train- ing with simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) optimizer. Evaluation under noiseless and depolarizing noise conditions demonstrates exceptional performance: 96.67% accuracy on BoT-IoT and 89.67% on IoT-23 datasets, surpassing quantum autoencoder approaches by over 7 percentage points.

Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

<title>Masked Symbol Modeling for Demodulation of Oversampled Baseband Communication Signals in Impulsive Noise-Dominated Channels</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding "in-between" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.

Abstract: We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.

Abstract: Limited data for low-resource languages typically yield weaker language models (LMs). Since pre-training is compute-intensive, it is more pragmatic to target improvements during fine-tuning. In this work, we examine the use of Active Learning (AL) methods augmented by structured data selection strategies which we term 'Active Learning schedulers', to boost the fine-tuning process with a limited amount of training data. We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability.

Abstract: We present hls4ml, a free and open-source platform that translates machine learning (ML) models from modern deep learning frameworks into high-level synthesis (HLS) code that can be integrated into full designs for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). With its flexible and modular design, hls4ml supports a large number of deep learning frameworks and can target HLS compilers from several vendors, including Vitis HLS, Intel oneAPI and Catapult HLS. Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform. The overarching design considerations for the generated HLS code are discussed, together with selected performance results.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.

Abstract: Given a network, the critical node detection problem finds a subset of nodes whose removal disrupts the network connectivity. Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow.

Abstract: Modern computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) systems show promises at generating chemically valid reaction steps but struggle to incorporate strategic considerations such as convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences. We introduce a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into code. Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.

Abstract: Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.

<title>Semantic-aware Random Convolution and Source Matching for Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.

Abstract: Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.

<title>Q2D2: A Geometry-Aware Audio Codec Leveraging Two-Dimensional Quantization</title>

Abstract: Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.

<title>Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation from Six Wearable Sensor Modalities in Multi-Motion-State Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).

Abstract: Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.

Abstract: Learning the structure of a Bayesian network from decentralized data poses two major challenges: (i) ensuring rigorous privacy guarantees for participants, and (ii) avoiding communication costs that scale poorly with dimensionality. In this work, we introduce Fed-Sparse-BNSL, a novel federated method for learning linear Gaussian Bayesian network structures that addresses both challenges. By combining differential privacy with greedy updates that target only a few relevant edges per participant, Fed-Sparse-BNSL efficiently uses the privacy budget while keeping communication costs low. Our careful algorithmic design preserves model identifiability and enables accurate structure estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves utility close to non-private baselines while offering substantially stronger privacy and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Bipartite networks are widely used to encode the ecological interactions. Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns. These results illustrate the methodological and practical advantages of joint modeling over separate network analyses in the study of bipartite systems.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated into high-stakes domains, there is a growing need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.

Abstract: Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

Abstract: Decision trees and random forest remain highly competitive for classification on medium-sized, standard datasets due to their robustness, minimal preprocessing requirements, and interpretability. However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.

<title>Dimension-free error estimate for diffusion model and optimal scheduling</title>

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.

Abstract: LLMs and Agents have achieved impressive progress in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific discovery. However, existing benchmarks primarily measure correctness, overlooking the diversity of methods behind solutions. True innovation depends not only on producing correct answers but also on the originality of the approach. We present InnoGym, the first benchmark and framework designed to systematically evaluate the innovation potential of AI agents. InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.

Abstract: This chapter opens with a review of classic tools for regression, a subset of machine learning that seeks to find relationships between variables. With the advent of scientific machine learning this field has moved from a purely data-driven (statistical) formalism to a constrained or ``physics-informed'' formalism, which integrates physical knowledge and methods from traditional computational engineering. In the first part, we introduce the general concepts and the statistical flavor of regression versus other forms of curve fitting. We then move to an overview of traditional methods from machine learning and their classification and ways to link these to traditional computational science. Finally, we close with a note on methods to combine machine learning and numerical methods for physics

Abstract: Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.

Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations.

Abstract: Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.

Abstract: Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.

Abstract: Massively parallel simulation has reduced reinforcement learning (RL) training time for robots from days to minutes. However, achieving fast and reliable sim-to-real RL for humanoid control remains difficult due to the challenges introduced by factors such as high dimensionality and domain randomization. In this work, we introduce a simple and practical recipe based on off-policy RL algorithms, i.e., FastSAC and FastTD3, that enables rapid training of humanoid locomotion policies in just 15 minutes with a single RTX 4090 GPU. Our simple recipe stabilizes off-policy RL algorithms at massive scale with thousands of parallel environments through carefully tuned design choices and minimalist reward functions. We demonstrate rapid end-to-end learning of humanoid locomotion controllers on Unitree G1 and Booster T1 robots under strong domain randomization, e.g., randomized dynamics, rough terrain, and push perturbations, as well as fast training of whole-body human-motion tracking policies. We provide videos and open-source implementation at: https://younggyo.me/fastsac-humanoid.

<title>Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling</title>

Abstract: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.

<title>Improved Mean Flows: On the Challenges of Fastforward Generative Models</title>

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.

Abstract: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.

Abstract: Subgraph counting is a fundamental task for analyzing structural patterns in graph-structured data, with important applications in domains such as computational biology and social network analysis, where recurring motifs reveal functional and organizational properties. In this paper, we propose localized versions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms to improve both expressivity and computational efficiency for this task. We introduce Local $k$-WL, which we prove to be more expressive than $k$-WL and at most as expressive as $(k+1)$-WL, and provide a characterization of patterns whose subgraph and induced subgraph counts are invariant under Local $k$-WL equivalence. To enhance scalability, we present two variants -- Layer $k$-WL and Recursive $k$-WL -- that achieve greater time and space efficiency compared to applying $k$-WL on the entire graph. Additionally, we propose a novel fragmentation technique that decomposes complex subgraphs into simpler subpatterns, enabling the exact count of all induced subgraphs of size at most $4$ using only $1$-WL, with extensions possible for larger patterns when $k>1$. Building on these ideas, we develop a three-stage differentiable learning framework that combines subpattern counts to compute counts of more complex motifs, bridging combinatorial algorithm design with machine learning approaches. We also compare the expressive power of Local $k$-WL with existing GNN hierarchies and demonstrate that, under bounded time complexity, our methods are more expressive than prior approaches.

Abstract: Conventional medical cancer screening methods are costly, labor-intensive, and extremely difficult to scale. Although AI can improve cancer detection, most systems rely on complex or specialized medical data, making them impractical for large-scale screening. We introduce Can-SAVE, a lightweight AI system that ranks population-wide cancer risks solely based on medical history events. By integrating survival model outputs into a gradient-boosting framework, our approach detects subtle, long-term patient risk patterns - often well before clinical symptoms manifest. Can-SAVE was rigorously evaluated on a real-world dataset of 2.5 million adults spanning five Russian regions, marking the study as one of the largest and most comprehensive deployments of AI-driven cancer risk assessment. In a retrospective oncologist-supervised study over 1.9M patients, Can-SAVE achieves a 4-10x higher detection rate at identical screening volumes and an Average Precision (AP) of 0.228 vs. 0.193 for the best baseline (LoRA-tuned Qwen3-Embeddings via DeepSeek-R1 summarization). In a year-long prospective pilot (426K patients), our method almost doubled the cancer detection rate (+91%) and increased population coverage by 36% over the national screening protocol. The system demonstrates practical scalability: a city-wide population of 1 million patients can be processed in under three hours using standard hardware, enabling seamless clinical integration. This work proves that Can-SAVE achieves nationally significant cancer detection improvements while adhering to real-world public healthcare constraints, offering immediate clinical utility and a replicable framework for population-wide screening. Code for training and feature engineering is available at https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/Can-SAVE.

Abstract: The ProxSkip algorithm for distributed optimization is gaining increasing attention due to its effectiveness in reducing communication. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and fail to achieve linear speedup with respect to the number of nodes. Key questions regarding its behavior in the non-convex setting and the achievability of linear speedup remain open. In this paper, we revisit ProxSkip and address both questions. We provide a comprehensive analysis for stochastic non-convex, convex, and strongly convex problems, revealing the effects of gradient noise, local updates, network connectivity, and data heterogeneity on its convergence. We prove that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup across all three settings, and can further achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we show that properly increasing local updates effectively reduces communication complexity.

Abstract: Real-world time series data often exhibits substantial missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to addressing this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which poses a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges under a high missing rate and are, moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method that estimates uncertainty with ensembles of quantile-regression-based task networks and incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate and reliable imputations, but also remains computationally efficient due to its non-generative framework. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, and the results demonstrates superior performance in both deterministic and probabilistic imputation compared to baselines across most experimental settings.

Abstract: Many studies integrate federated learning (FL) with self-supervised learning (SSL) to take advantage of raw data distributed across edge devices. However, edge devices often struggle with high computational and communication costs imposed by SSL and FL algorithms. With the deployment of more complex and large-scale models, these challenges are exacerbated. To tackle this, we propose Layer-Wise Federated Self-Supervised Learning (LW-FedSSL), which allows edge devices to incrementally train a small part of the model at a time. Specifically, in LW-FedSSL, training is decomposed into multiple stages, with each stage responsible for only a specific layer of the model. Since only a portion of the model is active for training at any given time, LW-FedSSL significantly reduces computational requirements. Additionally, only the active model portion needs to be exchanged between the FL server and clients, reducing communication overhead. This enables LW-FedSSL to jointly address both computational and communication challenges of FL client devices. It can achieve up to a $3.34 \times$ reduction in memory usage, $4.20 \times$ fewer computational operations (giga floating point operations, GFLOPs), and a $5.07 \times$ lower communication cost while maintaining performance comparable to its end-to-end training counterpart. Furthermore, we explore a progressive training strategy called Progressive Federated Self-Supervised Learning (Prog-FedSSL), which offers a $1.84\times$ reduction in GFLOPs and a $1.67\times$ reduction in communication costs while maintaining the same memory requirements as end-to-end training. Although the resource efficiency of Prog-FedSSL is lower than that of LW-FedSSL, its performance improvements make it a viable candidate for FL environments with more lenient resource constraints.

Abstract: In clustering algorithm selection, we are given a massive dataset and must efficiently select which clustering algorithm to use. We study this problem in a semi-supervised setting, with an unknown ground-truth clustering that we can only access through expensive oracle queries. Ideally, the clustering algorithm's output will be structurally close to the ground truth. We approach this problem by introducing a notion of size generalization for clustering algorithm accuracy. We identify conditions under which we can (1) subsample the massive clustering instance, (2) evaluate a set of candidate algorithms on the smaller instance, and (3) guarantee that the algorithm with the best accuracy on the small instance will have the best accuracy on the original big instance. We provide theoretical size generalization guarantees for three classic clustering algorithms: single-linkage, k-means++, and (a smoothed variant of) Gonzalez's k-centers heuristic. We validate our theoretical analysis with empirical results, observing that on real-world clustering instances, we can use a subsample of as little as 5% of the data to identify which algorithm is best on the full dataset.

Abstract: Interpretable models can have advantages over black-box models, and interpretability is essential for the application of machine learning in critical settings, such as aviation or medicine. This article introduces the LASSO-Clip-EN (LCEN) algorithm for nonlinear, interpretable feature selection and machine learning modeling. In a wide variety of artificial and empirical datasets, LCEN constructed sparse and frequently more accurate models than other methods, including sparse, nonlinear methods, on tested datasets. LCEN was empirically observed to be robust against many issues typically present in datasets and modeling, including noise, multicollinearity, and data scarcity. As a feature selection algorithm, LCEN matched or surpassed the thresholded elastic net but was, on average, 10.3-fold faster based on our experiments. LCEN for feature selection can also rediscover multiple physical laws from empirical data. As a machine learning algorithm, when tested on processes with no known physical laws, LCEN achieved better results than many other dense and sparse methods -- including being comparable to or better than ANNs on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional transformers discretize spatio-temporal dimensions, limiting their ability to model continuous dynamical weather processes. Moreover, their reliance on increased depth to capture complex dependencies results in higher computational cost and parameter redundancy. We address these issues with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for global spatial operators with a transformer parameterised Neural ODE for continuous-time dynamics, yielding a space-time continuous model for weather forecasting. Our proposed method achieves competitive forecasting performance even with a shallow, single-layer transformer encoder mitigating the reliance on deeper networks. STC-ViT generates complete forecast trajectories with an inference speed of only 0.125 seconds and achieves strong medium-range forecasting skill on 1.5-degree WeatherBench 2 as compared to state-of-the-art data-driven and NWP models trained on higher-resolution data, with substantially lower data and compute costs. We also provide detailed empirical analysis on model's performance with respect to denser time grids, higher-accuracy ODE solvers, and deeper transformer stacks.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are probabilistic meta-learning models that map sets of observations to posterior predictive distributions, enabling inference at arbitrary domain points. Their capacity to handle variable-sized collections of unstructured observations, combined with simple maximum-likelihood training and uncertainty-aware predictions, makes them well-suited for modeling data over continuous domains. Since their introduction, several variants have been proposed. Early approaches typically represented observed data using finite-dimensional summary embeddings obtained through aggregation schemes such as mean pooling. However, this strategy fundamentally mismatches the infinite-dimensional nature of the generative processes that NPs aim to capture. Convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNPs) address this limitation by constructing infinite-dimensional functional embeddings processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enforce translation equivariance. Yet CNNs with local spatial kernels struggle to capture long-range dependencies without resorting to large kernels, which impose significant computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Spectral ConvCNP (SConvCNP), which performs global convolution in the frequency domain. Inspired by Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), our approach directly parameterizes convolution kernels in the frequency domain, leveraging the relatively compact yet global Fourier representation of many natural signals. We validate the effectiveness of SConvCNP on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating how ideas from operator learning can advance the capabilities of NPs.

Abstract: The Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model has long been the preferred survival model for its explainability. However, to increase its predictive power beyond its linear log-risk, it was extended to utilize deep neural networks, sacrificing its explainability. In this work, we explore the potential of self-explaining neural networks (SENN) for survival analysis. We propose a new locally explainable Cox proportional hazards model, named CoxSE, by estimating a locally-linear log-hazard function using the SENN. We also propose a modification to the Neural additive (NAM) model, hybrid with SENN, named CoxSENAM, which enables the control of the stability and consistency of the generated explanations.
  Several experiments using synthetic and real datasets are presented, benchmarking CoxSE and CoxSENAM against a NAM-based model, a DeepSurv model explained with SHAP, and a linear CPH model. The results show that, unlike the NAM-based model, the SENN-based model can provide more stable and consistent explanations while maintaining the predictive power of the black-box model. The results also show that, due to their structural design, NAM-based models demonstrate better robustness to non-informative features. Among the models, the hybrid model exhibits the best robustness.

Abstract: Effective feature selection is essential for optimizing contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) in large-scale online systems, where suboptimal features can degrade rewards, interpretability, and efficiency. Traditional feature selection often prioritizes outcome correlation, neglecting the crucial role of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) across arms in CMAB decision-making. This paper introduces two novel, model-free filter methods, Heterogeneous Incremental Effect (HIE) and Heterogeneous Distribution Divergence (HDD), specifically designed to identify features driving HTE. HIE quantifies a feature's value based on its ability to induce changes in the optimal arm, while HDD measures its impact on reward distribution divergence across arms. These methods are computationally efficient, robust to model mis-specification, and adaptable to various feature types, making them suitable for rapid screening in dynamic environments where retraining complex models is infeasible. We validate HIE and HDD on synthetic data with known ground truth and in a large-scale commercial recommender system, demonstrating their consistent ability to identify influential HTE features and thereby enhance CMAB performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes while retaining previous knowledge. Although pre-trained model (PTM) based approaches show strong performance, directly fine-tuning PTMs on incremental task streams often causes renewed catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes a Dual-Prototype Network with Task-wise Adaptation (DPTA) for PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate confusable classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that DPTA consistently surpasses recent methods by 1\% - 5\%. Notably, on the VTAB dataset, it achieves approximately 3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The code is open-sourced in https://github.com/Yorkxzm/DPTA}

Abstract: We investigate fingerprints in pretraining datasets for large language models (LLMs) through dataset classification experiments. Building on prior work demonstrating the existence of fingerprints or biases in popular computer vision datasets, we analyze popular open-source pretraining datasets for LLMs derived from CommonCrawl including C4, RefinedWeb, DolmaCC, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb, and DCLM-Baseline. Despite those datasets being obtained with similar curation steps, neural networks can classify surprisingly well which dataset a single text sequence belongs to, significantly better than a human can. This indicates that small differences in filtering and processing pipelines induce fingerprints. Those fingerprints are evident in formatting, vocabulary, and content distributions, and can negatively impact cross-dataset generalization. Additionally, we show that these fingerprints propagate through training: sequences generated by models trained on those datasets can be accurately classified by a classifier trained on the original datasets. This can offer insights into data characteristics that are typically undisclosed by LLM developers, including pretraining mixture proportions and finetuning data sources.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous property of many biological systems and has profound implications for computation. While it is conceivable to optimize neuronal and synaptic heterogeneity for a specific task, such top-down optimization is biologically implausible, prone to catastrophic forgetting, and both data- and energy-intensive. In contrast, biological organisms, with remarkable capacity to perform numerous tasks with minimal metabolic cost, exhibit a heterogeneity that is inherent, stable during adulthood, and task-unspecific. Inspired by this intrinsic form of heterogeneity, we investigate the utility of variations in neuronal time constants for solving hundreds of distinct temporal tasks of varying complexity. Our results show that intrinsic heterogeneity significantly enhances performance and robustness in an implementation-independent manner, indicating its usefulness for both (rate-based) machine learning and (spike-coded) neuromorphic applications. Importantly, only skewed heterogeneity profiles-reminiscent of those found in biology-produce such performance gains. We further demonstrate that this computational advantage eliminates the need for large networks, allowing comparable performance with substantially lower operational, metabolic, and energetic costs, respectively in silico, in vivo, and on neuromorphic hardware. Finally, we discuss the implications of intrinsic (rather than task-induced) heterogeneity for the design of efficient artificial systems, particularly novel neuromorphic devices that exhibit similar device-to-device variability.

Abstract: Reliably predicting the behavior of language models -- such as whether their outputs are correct or have been adversarially manipulated -- is a fundamentally challenging task. This is often made even more difficult as frontier language models are offered only through closed-source APIs, providing only black-box access. In this paper, we predict the behavior of black-box language models by asking follow-up questions and taking the probabilities of responses \emph{as} representations to train reliable predictors. We first demonstrate that training a linear model on these responses reliably and accurately predicts model correctness on question-answering and reasoning benchmarks. Surprisingly, this can \textit{even outperform white-box linear predictors} that operate over model internals or activations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these follow-up question responses can reliably distinguish between a clean version of an LLM and one that has been adversarially influenced via a system prompt to answer questions incorrectly or to introduce bugs into generated code. Finally, we show that they can also be used to differentiate between black-box LLMs, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API. Overall, our work shows promise in monitoring black-box language model behavior, supporting their deployment in larger, autonomous systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning models are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.

Abstract: We pose a fundamental question in computational learning theory: can we efficiently test whether a training set satisfies the assumptions of a given noise model? This question has remained unaddressed despite decades of research on learning in the presence of noise. In this work, we show that this task is tractable and present the first efficient algorithm to test various noise assumptions on the training data.
  To model this question, we extend the recently proposed testable learning framework of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2023) and require a learner to run an associated test that satisfies the following two conditions: (1) whenever the test accepts, the learner outputs a classifier along with a certificate of optimality, and (2) the test must pass for any dataset drawn according to a specified modeling assumption on both the marginal distribution and the noise model. We then consider the problem of learning halfspaces over Gaussian marginals with Massart noise (where each label can be flipped with probability less than $1/2$ depending on the input features), and give a fully-polynomial time testable learning algorithm.
  We also show a separation between the classical setting of learning in the presence of structured noise and testable learning. In fact, for the simple case of random classification noise (where each label is flipped with fixed probability $\eta = 1/2$), we show that testable learning requires super-polynomial time while classical learning is trivial.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose $\texttt{CTRL}$, a framework for $\texttt{C}$ritic $\texttt{T}$raining via $\texttt{R}$einforcement $\texttt{L}$earning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with $\texttt{CTRL}$ significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.

Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.

Abstract: Synthetically-generated data plays an increasingly larger role in training large language models. However, while synthetic data has been found to be useful, studies have also shown that without proper curation it can cause LLM performance to plateau, or even "collapse", after many training iterations. In this paper, we formalize this question and develop a theoretical framework to investigate how much curation is needed in order to ensure that LLM performance continually improves. Our analysis is inspired by boosting, a classic machine learning technique that leverages a very weak learning algorithm to produce an arbitrarily good classifier. The approach we analyze subsumes many recently proposed methods for training LLMs on synthetic data, and thus our analysis sheds light on why they are successful, and also suggests opportunities for future improvement. We present experiments that validate our theory, and show that dynamically focusing labeling resources on the most challenging examples -- in much the same way that boosting focuses the efforts of the weak learner -- leads to improved performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based and CNN-based methods demonstrate strong performance in long-term time series forecasting. However, their high computational and storage requirements can hinder large-scale deployment. To address this limitation, we propose integrating lightweight MLP with advanced architectures using knowledge distillation (KD). Our preliminary study reveals different models can capture complementary patterns, particularly multi-scale and multi-period patterns in the temporal and frequency domains. Based on this observation, we introduce TimeDistill, a cross-architecture KD framework that transfers these patterns from teacher models (e.g., Transformers, CNNs) to MLP. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that our KD approach can be interpreted as a specialized form of mixup data augmentation. TimeDistill improves MLP performance by up to 18.6%, surpassing teacher models on eight datasets. It also achieves up to 7X faster inference and requires 130X fewer parameters. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations to highlight the versatility and effectiveness of TimeDistill.

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for situational and context-aware decision-making. Motivated by a real-world scenario, this work addresses intent predictions of smart device users in the vicinity of vehicles by modeling sequential spatiotemporal data. However, in real-world scenarios, environmental factors and sensor limitations can result in non-stationary and irregularly sampled data, posing significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose STaRFormer, a Transformer-based approach that can serve as a universal framework for sequential modeling. STaRFormer utilizes a new dynamic attention-based regional masking scheme combined with a novel semi-supervised contrastive learning paradigm to enhance task-specific latent representations. Comprehensive experiments on 56 datasets varying in types (including non-stationary and irregularly sampled), tasks, domains, sequence lengths, training samples, and applications demonstrate the efficacy of STaRFormer, achieving notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization. Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of maximizing the conditional entropy (uncertainty) of the label given spurious factors, our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) fundamentally limits inference speed, as each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, adopting a draft-then-verify strategy to accelerate token generation. While the EAGLE series achieves strong acceleration, its requirement of training a separate draft head for each target model introduces substantial adaptation costs. In this work, we propose \textbf{PARD (PARallel Draft)}, a novel speculative decoding method featuring \textit{target-independence} and \textit{parallel token prediction}. Specifically, PARD enables a single draft model to be applied across an entire family of target models without requiring separate training for each variant, thereby minimizing adaptation costs. Meanwhile, PARD substantially accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens within a single forward pass of the draft phase. To further reduce the training adaptation cost of PARD, we propose a COnditional Drop-token (COD) mechanism based on the integrity of prefix key-value states, enabling autoregressive draft models to be adapted into parallel draft models at low-cost. Our experiments show that the proposed COD method improves draft model training efficiency by \textbf{3$\times$} compared with traditional masked prediction training. On the \texttt{vLLM} inference framework, PARD achieves up to \textbf{3.67$\times$} speedup on LLaMA3.1-8B, reaching \textbf{264.88} tokens per second, which is \textbf{1.15$\times$} faster than EAGLE-3. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AIG-AIMA/PARD.

Abstract: We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor. This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates, underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior. Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Wildfires pose a threat to ecosystems, economies and public safety, particularly in Mediterranean regions such as Spain. Accurate predictive models require high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture complex dynamics of environmental and human factors. To address the scarcity of fine-grained wildfire datasets in Spain, we introduce IberFire: a spatio-temporal dataset with 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 120 features across eight categories: auxiliary data, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity and land cover. All features and processing rely on open-access data and tools, with a publicly available codebase ensuring transparency and applicability. IberFire offers enhanced spatial granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datasets, and provides a reproducible framework. It supports advanced wildfire risk modelling via Machine Learning and Deep Learning, facilitates climate trend analysis, and informs fire prevention and land management strategies. The dataset is freely available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.

Abstract: Addressing climate change requires coordinated policy efforts of nations worldwide. These efforts are informed by scientific reports, which rely in part on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), prominent tools used to assess the economic impacts of climate policies. However, traditional IAMs optimize policies based on a single objective, limiting their ability to capture the trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. As a result, policy recommendations have been criticized for perpetuating inequalities, fueling disagreements during policy negotiations. We introduce Justice, the first framework integrating IAM with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL). By incorporating multiple objectives, Justice generates policy recommendations that shed light on equity while balancing climate and economic goals. Further, using multiple agents can provide a realistic representation of the interactions among the diverse policy actors. We identify equitable Pareto-optimal policies using our framework, which facilitates deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy.

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling inversely with model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of Bayesian recovery for solving inverse problems with general prior, forward operator and noise distributions. We consider posterior sampling according to an approximate prior $\mathcal{P}$, and establish sufficient conditions for stable and accurate recovery with high probability. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound that shows that the sample complexity depends on (i) the intrinsic complexity of $\mathcal{P}$, quantified by its so-called approximate covering number, and (ii) concentration bounds for the forward operator and noise distributions. As a key application, we specialize to generative priors, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a latent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample complexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing the efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on deterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random sampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is determined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of $\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in Bayesian recovery as well. Overall, our framework unifies and extends prior work, providing rigorous guarantees for the sample complexity of solving Bayesian inverse problems with arbitrary distributions.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained classification network an a posteriori optimization of the classification score by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting. This allows a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network. Moreover, this multidimensional threshold-based setting makes it possible to define score-oriented losses, which are based on the interpretation of the threshold as a random variable. Our experiments show that the multidimensional threshold tuning yields consistent performance improvements across various networks and datasets, and that the proposed multiclass score-oriented losses are competitive with standard loss functions, resembling the advantages observed in the binary case.

Abstract: We present the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), a compact and interpretable architecture for dimension reduction in translation-equivariant datasets. FINE integrates reversible filters and monotonic activation functions with a Fourier truncation bottleneck, achieving information-preserving compression that respects translational symmetry. This design offers a new perspective on symmetry-aware learning, linking spectral truncation to group-equivariant representations. The proposed FINE architecture is tested on one-dimensional nonlinear wave interaction, one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky turbulence dataset, and a two-dimensional turbulence dataset. FINE achieves an overall 4.9-9.1 times lower reconstruction error than convolutional autoencoders while using only 13-21% of their parameters. The results highlight FINE's effectiveness in representing complex physical systems with minimal dimension in the latent space. The proposed framework provides a principled framework for interpretable, low-parameter, and symmetry-preserving dimensional reduction, bridging the gap between Fourier representations and modern neural architectures for scientific and physics-informed learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been an effective approach for improving Large Language Models' reasoning in domains such as coding and mathematics. Here, we apply RLVR methods towards forecasting future real-world events - a challenging task for RL due to the very noisy (and delayed) outcomes involved. Using a novel dataset of recent questions from a prediction market, and accompanying relevant news headlines, we show that a compact (14B) reasoning model can be trained to match or surpass the predictive accuracy of frontier models like o1, while greatly improving probabilistic calibration. The model's performance is also practically meaningful: in a Polymarket trading simulation, we estimate that its bets would have yielded a return on investment of over 10% across all questions in the test set. We detail and compare approaches used in training our model, including augmenting our training-data with synthetic prediction questions, guardrails for learning stability, and median prediction sampling at inference-time.

Abstract: Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity are widely observed in the biological brain, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we find that when a learning method is regularized with L2 weight decay, its learning signal will gradually align with the direction of the Hebbian learning signal as it approaches stationarity. This Hebbian-like behavior is not unique to SGD: almost any learning rule, including random ones, can exhibit the same signature long before learning has ceased. We also provide a theoretical explanation for anti-Hebbian plasticity in regression tasks, demonstrating how it can arise naturally from gradient or input noise, and offering a potential reason for the observed anti-Hebbian effects in the brain. Certainly, our proposed mechanisms do not rule out any conventionally established forms of Hebbian plasticity and could coexist with them extensively in the brain. A key insight for neurophysiology is the need to develop ways to experimentally distinguish these two types of Hebbian observations.

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.

Abstract: The Influence Function (IF) is a widely used technique for assessing the impact of individual training samples on model predictions. However, existing IF methods often fail to provide reliable influence estimates in deep neural networks, particularly when applied to noisy training data. This issue does not stem from inaccuracies in parameter change estimation, which has been the primary focus of prior research, but rather from deficiencies in loss change estimation, specifically due to the sharpness of validation risk. In this work, we establish a theoretical connection between influence estimation error, validation set risk, and its sharpness, underscoring the importance of flat validation minima for accurate influence estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimation form of Influence Function specifically designed for flat validation minima. Experimental results across various tasks validate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Understanding the remarkable efficacy of Adam when training transformer-based language models has become a central research topic within the optimization community. To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study - training over 1500 language models across different data configurations and scales - comparing Adam to several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam momentum parameters to be equal, beta1 = beta2. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords new theoretical insights, highlights the "secret sauce" on top of signed momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and variance of gradients-one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that helps them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g., unable to recognize the 4th stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Removing image backgrounds nearly doubles accuracy (21.09 percentage points), revealing that contextual visual cues trigger these biased responses. Further analysis of VLMs' reasoning patterns shows that counting accuracy initially rises with thinking tokens, reaching ~40%, before declining with excessive reasoning. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and a human-supervised automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code and data are available at: vlmsarebiased.github.io.

<title>Adaptive Plane Reformatting for 4D Flow MRI using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Background and Objective: Plane reformatting for four-dimensional phase contrast MRI (4D flow MRI) is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, which limits fast cardiovascular flow assessment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) trains agents to iteratively adjust plane position and orientation, enabling accurate plane reformatting without the need for detailed landmarks, making it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods assume that test volumes share the same spatial alignment as the training data, limiting generalization across scanners and institutions. To address this limitation, we introduce AdaPR (Adaptive Plane Reformatting), a DRL framework that uses a local coordinate system to navigate volumes with arbitrary positions and orientations.
  Methods: We implemented AdaPR using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm and validated it on 88 4D flow MRI datasets acquired from multiple vendors, including patients with congenital heart disease.
  Results: AdaPR achieved a mean angular error of 6.32 +/- 4.15 degrees and a distance error of 3.40 +/- 2.75 mm, outperforming global-coordinate DRL methods and alternative non-DRL methods. AdaPR maintained consistent accuracy under different volume orientations and positions. Flow measurements from AdaPR planes showed no significant differences compared to two manual observers, with excellent correlation (R^2 = 0.972 and R^2 = 0.968), comparable to inter-observer agreement (R^2 = 0.969).
  Conclusion: AdaPR provides robust, orientation-independent plane reformatting for 4D flow MRI, achieving flow quantification comparable to expert observers. Its adaptability across datasets and scanners makes it a promising candidate for medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g., Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method, often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks. Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples in 40 minutes on a single GPU. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dynamite321/T-SHIRT.

Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

Abstract: Neural models learn representations of high-dimensional data on low-dimensional manifolds. Multiple factors, including stochasticities in the training process, model architectures, and additional inductive biases, may induce different representations, even when learning the same task on the same data. However, it has recently been shown that when a latent structure is shared between distinct latent spaces, relative distances between representations can be preserved, up to distortions. Building on this idea, we demonstrate that exploiting the differential-geometric structure of latent spaces of neural models, it is possible to capture precisely the transformations between representational spaces trained on similar data distributions. Specifically, we assume that distinct neural models parametrize approximately the same underlying manifold, and introduce a representation based on the pullback metric that captures the intrinsic structure of the latent space, while scaling efficiently to large models. We validate experimentally our method on model stitching and retrieval tasks, covering autoencoders and vision foundation discriminative models, across diverse architectures, datasets, and pretraining schemes.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is challenged by arduous pipelines to transform raw experimental data into atomic models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling trajectory of a pretrained biomolecular structure prediction model using both global and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/SpectRe/.

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small, uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed, especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent (AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the proposed method for pruning are also provided.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings, multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations, reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train a 7B parameter CAAT-Net model and show that tensor-parallel communication can be reduced by up to 50% with no significant drop in pretraining accuracy across nearly all evaluated benchmarks. We also experiment with smaller 130M and 1.1B models to show the robustness and scalability of our method. We find that, in some scenarios, validation loss can even improve when reducing communication. Finally, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates both training and inference workloads across various settings and model sizes.

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to the sensitive reference texts. It interprets sampling from the LLM's next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling without any privacy cost from a small superset of the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent $8\times$ (or more) reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. InvisibleInk is able to generate, for the first time, high-quality private long-form text at less than $4$-$8\times$ times the computation cost of non-private generation, paving the way for its practical use. We open-source a pip-installable Python package (invink) for InvisibleInk at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/invisibleink.

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment. Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work, we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

<title>Quantile Reward Policy Optimization: Alignment with Pointwise Regression and Exact Partition Functions</title>

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast, simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Quantile Reward Policy Optimization (QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function, removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves top performance on chat and coding evaluations--reward model scores, AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode--compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinear transformations - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or complex real-world data. Furthermore, these methods also exhibit poor scalability in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during optimization. We propose a data-adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike standard NVAR and RC models, the MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities, while preserving a simple readout structure and improving scalability. Initial experiments across multiple chaotic systems, tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions, showed that the adaptive model outperformed in predictive accuracy the standard NVAR, a leaky echo state network (ESN) - the most common RC model - and a hybrid ESN, thereby showing robust forecasting under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend equivariant network theory to this regime of 'flows' -- one-parameter Lie subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion. We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant: their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage. Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress. This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<title>Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference: Theory and Practice</title>

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput. Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing private training data from trained neural networks. While prior studies have primarily examined unimodal deep networks, the vulnerability of vision-language models (VLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MI attacks on VLMs to understand their susceptibility to leaking private visual training data. Our work makes two main contributions. First, tailored to the token-generative nature of VLMs, we introduce a suite of token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies, providing a comprehensive analysis of VLMs' vulnerability under different attack formulations. Second, based on the observation that tokens vary in their visual grounding, and hence their gradients differ in informativeness for image reconstruction, we propose Sequence-based Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW) as a novel MI for VLMs. SMI-AW dynamically reweights each token's loss gradient according to its visual grounding, enabling the optimization to focus on visually informative tokens and more effectively guide the reconstruction of private images. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations on a range of state-of-the-art VLMs across multiple datasets, we show that VLMs are susceptible to training data leakage. Human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack accuracy of 61.21%, underscoring the severity of these privacy risks. Notably, we demonstrate that publicly released VLMs are vulnerable to such attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for privacy safeguards as VLMs become increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. Additional experiments are provided in Supp.

Abstract: Behavior Regularized Policy Optimization (BRPO) leverages asymmetric (divergence) regularization to mitigate the distribution shift in offline Reinforcement Learning. This paper is the first to study the open question of symmetric regularization. We show that symmetric regularization does not permit an analytic optimal policy $\pi^*$, posing a challenge to practical utility of symmetric BRPO. We approximate $\pi^*$ by the Taylor series of Pearson-Vajda $\chi^n$ divergences and show that an analytic policy expression exists only when the series is capped at $n=5$. To compute the solution in a numerically stable manner, we propose to Taylor expand the conditional symmetry term of the symmetric divergence loss, leading to a novel algorithm: Symmetric $f$-Actor Critic (S$f$-AC). S$f$-AC achieves consistently strong results across various D4RL MuJoCo tasks. Additionally, S$f$-AC avoids per-environment failures observed in IQL, SQL, XQL and AWAC, opening up possibilities for more diverse and effective regularization choices for offline RL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time. We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the detector is deployed on tables with variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7 points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in real-world conditions is feasible, and demonstrates substantial improvements over previous approaches. Following acceptance of the paper, we are finalizing the administrative and licensing procedures necessary for releasing the source code. This extended version will be updated as soon as the release is complete.

Abstract: The success of federated learning (FL) ultimately depends on how strategic participants behave under partial observability, yet most formulations still treat FL as a static optimization problem. We instead view FL deployments as governed strategic systems and develop an analytical framework that separates welfare-improving behavior from metric gaming. Within this framework, we introduce indices that quantify manipulability, the price of gaming, and the price of cooperation, and we use them to study how rules, information disclosure, evaluation metrics, and aggregator-switching policies reshape incentives and cooperation patterns. We derive threshold conditions for deterring harmful gaming while preserving benign cooperation, and for triggering auto-switch rules when early-warning indicators become critical. Building on these results, we construct a design toolkit including a governance checklist and a simple audit-budget allocation algorithm with a provable performance guarantee. Simulations across diverse stylized environments and a federated learning case study consistently match the qualitative and quantitative patterns predicted by our framework. Taken together, our results provide design principles and operational guidelines for reducing metric gaming while sustaining stable, high-welfare cooperation in FL platforms.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in ML-driven power system research.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms, and training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX GPUs with Model FLOPs Utilization at expected levels. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models also significantly improve long-context efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Furthermore, the proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.

Abstract: We introduce ORACLE, a framework that explains neural networks on tabular and scientific design data. It fits ANOVA-style main and pairwise interaction effects to a model's prediction surface. ORACLE treats a trained network as a black-box response, learns an orthogonal factorial surrogate on a discretized input grid, and uses simple centering and $\mu$-rebalancing steps to obtain main- and interaction-effect tables that remain $L^2$-consistent with the original model. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly connected to classical design-of-experiments analyses. On synthetic factorial and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression benchmarks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth ANOVA interactions and hotspot structure than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability metrics. In latent image and text settings, ORACLE instead delineates its natural scope, and our results indicate that grid-based ANOVA surrogates are most effective when features admit interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering tabular workflows that require stable, DoE-style interaction summaries.

<title>ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion. Code available at https://github.com/WenboLuu/ToMA.

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis. Quantitative evaluation on the Brown Corpus yields a Silhouette score of 0.0564, outperforming a Word2Vec baseline (0.0215), demonstrating the model's ability to capture structural dependencies without supervision.

Abstract: In the realm of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) and privacy-focused medical applications, this paper proposes a multi-view clustering framework that links quantum field theory with federated healthcare analytics. The method uses heat kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures that capture the structure of diverse medical data. The framework is presented through the heat kernel distance (HKD) transformation, which has convergence guarantees. Two algorithms have been developed: The first, Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC), is used for central analysis. The second, Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC), is used for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals. FedHK-MVFC uses differential privacy and secure aggregation to enable HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic cardiovascular patient datasets demonstrate increased clustering accuracy, reduced communication, and retained efficiency compared to centralized methods. After being validated on 10,000 synthetic patient records across two hospitals, the methods proved useful for collaborative phenotyping involving electrocardiogram (ECG) data, cardiac imaging data, and behavioral data. The proposed methods' theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. These contributions establish a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, translating advanced mathematics into practical solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring rigor and clinical relevance.

Abstract: World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.

<title>Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations</title>

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the GP update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that PFNs are backbone architecture invariant and the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN, RNN and LSTM-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of E-03, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.Code:https://github.com/HoHongYeung/NeurIPS25-TRiCo.

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC (higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<title>Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences</title>

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. A signal that is correlated with the outcome of such a game can be used to focus the bets on a narrow range of high probability predictions. Diffusion models share the same paradigm in that they gradually concentrate the probability mass to fit the training data. We show that the information stored in an unconditional diffusion model captures, in part, the joint correlation between the components of the data variable $X$. Conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. The latter is only a small fraction of the total information in the neural network if the data is low-dimensional. We examine why this does not hinder conditional generation.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing adaptive canonicalization, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce EXP-CAM: an explanation generation and circuit discovery approach using Classifier Activation Matching. EXP-CAM can generate minimal and faithful explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. We aim to identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight auto-encoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers, consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation. Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal computations driving model decisions.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor, and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al. (2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations, using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1, suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires objectives and training schedules that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning.

Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed the accuracy of larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across four domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, operations research, and LLM reasoning, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored. The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making. Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency price movements.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet, what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains. The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments. Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced reproducibility in detail.

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization. For example, InternVL 3.5 gpt-oss 20B gains little robustness when its test compute is scaled, but such scaling adds significant robustness if we first robustify its vision encoder. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Thus, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

<title>Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization Breaks The Exploration Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, causing exploration to vanish and policies to converge prematurely. As a result, RL is widely believed to be incapable of expanding the reasoning frontier of LLMs. Existing entropy-regularized methods introduce an inevitable trade-off between reward and entropy, leading to exploration accompanied by non-negligible optimization bias. In this work, we prove that temperature-guided REINFORCE can modulate policy entropy, and propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which reformulates entropy regularization as a policy-gradient optimization problem. Rather than manipulating entropy directly, AEPO implicitly regulates it by applying a REINFORCE regularization term on temperature-adjusted samples, ensuring that entropy is controlled but never dominates optimization, thereby enabling arbitrary and principled entropy regulation. Experiments show that AEPO outperforms RL baselines on both pass@1 and pass@$k$, and even surpasses the base model on pass@1024. By modulating entropy precisely, AEPO achieves more effective optimization dynamics and provides direct empirical evidence that entropy, exploration, and performance are intrinsically linked.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.

<title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective</title>

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and MAE gains.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a well-documented challenge in model fine-tuning, particularly when the downstream domain has limited labeled data or differs substantially from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods largely operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the parameters of the pre-trained model, which can lead to models that are overly specialized to the observed downstream data. Recent studies suggest that one mechanism underlying such forgetting is the introduction of intruder dimensions into the representation space during fine-tuning. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and to enhance robustness, we propose Vector-based Feature Adaptation (VeFA), a new fine-tuning method that operates directly in the feature space, which naturally avoids generating intruder dimensions. VeFA performs element-wise adaptation on individual features, thereby ensuring that the effective fine-tuned weights always remain within the column space of the pre-trained weight matrix. This feature-space adaptation perspective is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables that induce distribution shifts, which posits that the influence of unobserved factors can be represented as an equivalent aggregate effect on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, VeFA preserves the pre-trained representations and improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate VeFA against LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG benchmarks, considering both standard fine-tuning performance and robustness; across these tasks, VeFA achieves comparable fine-tuning performance while consistently exhibiting stronger robustness.

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models, we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph capturing both state-premise and premise-premise relations. On the LeanDojo Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over 25\% across standard retrieval metrics. These results suggest that relational information is beneficial for premise selection.

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine learning models for survival analysis (MLSA). Using data from nearly 45,000 colorectal cancer patients in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S\~ao Paulo, we evaluated Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox), XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance (C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results highlight the potential and applicability of MLSA to improve survival prediction and support decision making.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Learning latent representations that are simultaneously expressive, geometrically well-structured, and reliably calibrated remains a central challenge for Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Standard VAEs typically assume a diagonal Gaussian posterior, which simplifies optimization but rules out correlated uncertainty and often yields entangled or redundant latent dimensions. We introduce the Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a tractable full-covariance extension of the VAE that augments the encoder with sample-specific diagonal scales and a global coupling matrix. This induces a multivariate Gaussian posterior of the form $N(\mu_\phi(x), C \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_\phi^2(x)) C^\top)$, enabling correlated latent factors while preserving a closed-form KL divergence and a simple reparameterization path. Beyond likelihood, we propose a multi-criterion evaluation protocol that jointly assesses reconstruction quality (MSE, ELBO), downstream discrimination (linear probes), probabilistic calibration (NLL, Brier, ECE), and unsupervised structure (NMI, ARI). Across Larochelle-style MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10/100, MVAE consistently matches or outperforms diagonal-covariance VAEs of comparable capacity, with particularly notable gains in calibration and clustering metrics at both low and high latent dimensions. Qualitative analyses further show smoother, more semantically coherent latent traversals and sharper reconstructions. All code, dataset splits, and evaluation utilities are released to facilitate reproducible comparison and future extensions of multivariate posterior models.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Abstract: Modern deep learning systems are typically deployed as open-loop function approximators: they map inputs to outputs in a single pass, without regulating how much computation or explanatory effort is spent on a given case. In safety-critical settings, this is brittle: easy and ambiguous inputs receive identical processing, and uncertainty is only read off retrospectively from raw probabilities. We introduce the Surgical Cognitive Interpreter (SCI), a lightweight closed-loop metacognitive control layer that wraps an existing stochastic model and turns prediction into an iterative process. SCI monitors a scalar interpretive state SP(t), here instantiated as a normalized entropy-based confidence signal, and adaptively decides whether to stop, continue sampling, or abstain. The goal is not to improve accuracy per se, but to regulate interpretive error {\Delta}SP and expose a safety signal that tracks when the underlying model is likely to fail. We instantiate SCI around Monte Carlo dropout classifiers in three domains: vision (MNIST digits), medical time series (MIT-BIH arrhythmia), and industrial condition monitoring (rolling-element bearings). In all cases, the controller allocates more inference steps to misclassified inputs than to correct ones (up to about 3-4x on MNIST and bearings, and 1.4x on MIT-BIH). The resulting {\Delta}SP acts as a usable safety signal for detecting misclassifications (AUROC 0.63 on MNIST, 0.70 on MIT-BIH, 0.86 on bearings).

Abstract: Rock discontinuities critically govern the mechanical behavior and stability of rock masses. Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches. This work advances quantitative characterization of rock mass structures, supporting safer and more reliable data-driven geotechnical design.

Abstract: Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamNX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to momentum SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamNX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/mengzhu0308/AdamNX.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. The code is available at github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.

Abstract: As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust-and-Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents. We release all of our code to support future work on multi-agent RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) is a cardinal technique for obtaining combinations of features, or principal components (PCs), that explain the variance of high-dimensional datasets in an interpretable manner. This involves solving a sparsity and orthogonality constrained convex maximization problem, which is extremely computationally challenging. Most existing works address sparse PCA via methods-such as iteratively computing one sparse PC and deflating the covariance matrix-that do not guarantee the orthogonality, let alone the optimality, of the resulting solution when we seek multiple mutually orthogonal PCs. We challenge this status by reformulating the orthogonality conditions as rank constraints and optimizing over the sparsity and rank constraints simultaneously. We design tight semidefinite relaxations to supply high-quality upper bounds, which we strengthen via additional second-order cone inequalities when each PC's individual sparsity is specified. Further, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the maximum amount of variance explained as a function of the support. We exploit these relaxations and bounds to propose exact methods and rounding mechanisms that, together, obtain solutions with a bound gap on the order of 0%-15% for real-world datasets with p = 100s or 1000s of features and r \in {2, 3} components. Numerically, our algorithms match (and sometimes surpass) the best performing methods in terms of fraction of variance explained and systematically return PCs that are sparse and orthogonal. In contrast, we find that existing methods like deflation return solutions that violate the orthogonality constraints, even when the data is generated according to sparse orthogonal PCs. Altogether, our approach solves sparse PCA problems with multiple components to certifiable (near) optimality in a practically tractable fashion.

Abstract: The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP excel in transferability and robust generalization across diverse datasets. However, adapting these models to new datasets or domains is computationally costly, especially in low-resource or few-shot settings, and existing prompt-learning methods often lack interpretability. We introduce Efficient Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (EPLKG), which uses a knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompts and, where KG coverage is limited, augments this bank with LLM-generated human-readable visual descriptions. EPLKG operates entirely on cached CLIP image and text embeddings and employs a lightweight Gumbel-Softmax module to select a single prompt per image-class pair, enabling low-memory, fast training. Across 11 benchmarks, EPLKG reduces per-image training time by up to 45 percent and peak GPU memory by around 30 to 40 percent compared to strong prompt-learning baselines, while keeping the average base-new harmonic-mean accuracy within 2 percentage points, thereby improving the efficiency of model adaptation without sacrificing competitive performance or interpretability.

<title>Families of costs with zero and nonnegative MTW tensor in optimal transport and the c-divergences</title>

Abstract: We study the information geometry of $\bcc$-divergences from families of costs of the form $\mathsf{c}(x, \barx) =\mathsf{u}(x^{\mathfrak{t}}\barx)$ through the optimal transport point of view. Here, $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}\barx$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of vectors $x, \barx$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with this cost. The condition that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form $\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert} and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of these solutions. The optimal map may be written explicitly in terms of the potential function. For cost functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families of {\it power function costs}. We express the divergence geometry of the $\mathsf{c}$-divergence in terms of the Kim-McCann metric, including a $\mathsf{c}$-Crouzeix identity and a formula for the primal connection. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions, which are used to construct a new \emph{local form} of the $\alpha$-divergences on probability simplices. We apply the optimal maps to sample the multivariate $t$-distribution.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.

Abstract: The recently emerging conditional diffusion models seem promising for mitigating the labor and expenses in building large 3D medical imaging datasets. However, previous studies on 3D CT generation primarily focus on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast and have yet to fully capitalize on the benefits of both semantic and textual conditions. In this paper, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework based on easily-acquired text prompts to generate anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; an anatomy-aware high-dynamic-range (HDR) autoencoder for high-fidelity feature extraction across varying intensity levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. Combined, these components enable data synthesis for segmentation tasks from only textual instructions. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.

Abstract: Generating VectorArt from text prompts is a challenging vision task, requiring diverse yet realistic depictions of the seen as well as unseen entities. However, existing research has been mostly limited to the generation of single objects, rather than comprehensive scenes comprising multiple elements. In response, this work introduces SVGCraft, a novel end-to-end framework for the creation of vector graphics depicting entire scenes from textual descriptions. Utilizing a pre-trained LLM for layout generation from text prompts, this framework introduces a technique for producing masked latents in specified bounding boxes for accurate object placement. It introduces a fusion mechanism for integrating attention maps and employs a diffusion U-Net for coherent composition, speeding up the drawing process. The resulting SVG is optimized using a pre-trained encoder and LPIPS loss with opacity modulation to maximize similarity. Additionally, this work explores the potential of primitive shapes in facilitating canvas completion in constrained environments. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, SVGCraft is demonstrated to surpass prior works in abstraction, recognizability, and detail, as evidenced by its performance metrics (CLIP-T: 0.4563, Cosine Similarity: 0.6342, Confusion: 0.66, Aesthetic: 6.7832). The code will be available at https://github.com/ayanban011/SVGCraft.

arXiv:2407.04157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...

To address these challenges, we narrows the scope of Affective Forecasting by introducing the concept of Human-interaction-based Emotion Forecasting (EF). This task is set within the context of a two-party interaction, positing that an individual's emotions are significantly influenced by their interaction partner's emotional expressions and informational cues. This dynamic provides a structured perspective for exploring the patterns of emotional change, thereby enhancing the feasibility of emotion forecasting.

Abstract: Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for $\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.

Abstract: Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to data privacy by reconstructing sensitive training samples from the knowledge embedded in trained machine learning models. Despite recent progress in enhancing the effectiveness of MIAs across diverse settings, defense strategies have lagged behind -- struggling to balance model utility with robustness against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In this work, we propose the ideal inversion error to measure the privacy leakage, and our theoretical and empirical investigations reveals that higher-rank features are inherently more prone to privacy leakage. Motivated by this insight, we propose a lightweight and effective defense strategy based on low-rank feature filtering, which explicitly reduces the attack surface by constraining the dimension of intermediate representations. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing defenses, achieving state-of-the-art performance against a wide range of MIAs. Notably, our approach remains effective even in challenging regimes involving high-resolution data and high-capacity models, where prior defenses fail to provide adequate protection.

Abstract: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

Abstract: Model selection is the process of choosing from a class of candidate models given data. For instance, methods such as the LASSO and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) formulate model selection as finding a sparse solution to a linear system of equations determined by training data. However, absent strong assumptions, such methods are highly unstable: if a single data point is removed from the training set, a different model may be selected. In this paper, we present a new approach to stabilizing model selection with theoretical stability guarantees that leverages a combination of bagging and an ''inflated'' argmax operation. Our method selects a small collection of models that all fit the data, and it is stable in that, with high probability, the removal of any training point will result in a collection of selected models that overlaps with the original collection. We illustrate this method in (a) a simulation in which strongly correlated covariates make standard LASSO model selection highly unstable, (b) a Lotka-Volterra model selection problem focused on identifying how competition in an ecosystem influences species' abundances, (c) a graph subset selection problem using cell-signaling data from proteomics, and (d) unsupervised $\kappa$-means clustering. In these settings, the proposed method yields stable, compact, and accurate collections of selected models, outperforming a variety of benchmarks.

Abstract: Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark. NeKo performs competitively on grammar and post-OCR correction as a multi-task model.

Abstract: Standard conformal prediction methods guarantee marginal coverage but often produce inefficient intervals that fail to adapt to local heteroscedasticity, while recent localized approaches often struggle to maintain validity across distinct subpopulations with varying noise profiles. To address these challenges, we introduce Localized Conformal Multi-Quantile Regression (LCMQR), a novel framework that synergizes multi-quantile information with kernel-based localization to construct efficient and adaptive prediction intervals. Theoretically, we resolve an inconsistency in Conformalized Composite Quantile Regression (CCQR) by proving that our consistent Average-then-Max scoring mechanism systematically yields tighter intervals than the Max-then-Average approach used in prior work. For heterogeneous environments, we extend this framework to Group-Calibrated LCMQR (GC-LCMQR) via a stratified calibration step that guarantees finite-sample validity within distinct subgroups. Experiments on benchmark datasets and an Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) task demonstrate that LCMQR achieves superior efficiency on standard benchmarks, while GC-LCMQR uniquely achieves group-level coverage for target subgroups in mixture populations where baselines fail.

Abstract: Visual localization, which estimates a camera's pose within a known scene, is a fundamental capability for autonomous systems. While absolute pose regression (APR) methods have shown promise for efficient inference, they often struggle with generalization. Recent approaches attempt to address this through data augmentation with varied viewpoints, yet they overlook a critical factor: appearance diversity. In this work, we identify appearance variation as the key to robust localization. Specifically, we first lift real 2D images into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring ability, enabling the synthesis of diverse training data that varies not just in poses but also in environmental conditions such as lighting and weather. To fully unleash the potential of the appearance-diverse data, we build a two-branch joint training pipeline with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing translation and rotation errors by 50\% and 41\% on indoor datasets, and 38\% and 44\% on outdoor datasets. Most notably, our method shows remarkable robustness in dynamic driving scenarios under varying weather conditions and in day-to-night scenarios, where previous APR methods fail.

Abstract: This paper considers blind inverse image restoration, the task of predicting a target image from a degraded source when the degradation (i.e. the forward operator) is unknown. Existing solutions typically rely on restrictive assumptions such as operator linearity, curated training data or narrow image distributions limiting their practicality. We introduce LADiBI, a training-free method leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion to solve diverse blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. Within a Bayesian framework, LADiBI uses text prompts to jointly encode priors for both target images and operators, unlocking unprecedented flexibility compared to existing methods. Additionally, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling algorithm that combines strategic operator initialization with iterative refinement of image and operator parameters, eliminating the need for highly constrained operator forms. Experiments show that LADiBI effectively handles both linear and challenging nonlinear image restoration problems across various image distributions, all without task-specific assumptions or retraining.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)' capabilities, existing pixel-grounding models operate in single-image settings, limiting their ability to perform detailed, fine-grained comparisons across multiple images. Conversely, current multi-image understanding models lack pixel-level grounding. Our work addresses this gap by introducing the task of multi-image pixel-grounded reasoning alongside PRIMA, an LVLM that integrates pixel-level grounding with robust multi-image reasoning to produce contextually rich, pixel-grounded explanations. Central to PRIMA is SQuARE, a vision module that injects cross-image relational context into compact query-based visual tokens before fusing them with the language backbone. To support training and evaluation, we curate M4SEG, a new multi-image reasoning segmentation benchmark consisting of $\sim$744K question-answer pairs that require fine-grained visual understanding across multiple images. PRIMA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with $7.83\%$ and $11.25\%$ improvements in Recall and S-IoU, respectively. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SQuARE module in capturing cross-image relationships.

<title>Heterogeneous transfer learning for high-dimensional regression with feature mismatch</title>

Abstract: We consider Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HTL) from a source to a new target domain for high-dimensional regression with differing feature sets. Most homogeneous TL methods assume that target and source domains share the same feature space, which limits their practical applicability. In applications, the target and source features are frequently different due to the inability to measure certain variables in data-poor target environments. Conversely, existing HTL methods do not provide statistical error guarantees, limiting their utility for scientific discovery. Our method first learns a feature map between the missing and observed features, leveraging the vast source data, and then imputes the missing features in the target. Using the combined matched and imputed features, we then perform a two-step transfer learning for penalized regression. We develop upper bounds on estimation and prediction errors, assuming that the source and target parameters differ sparsely but without assuming sparsity in the target model. We obtain results for both when the feature map is linear and when it is nonparametrically specified as unknown functions. Our results elucidate how estimation and prediction errors of HTL depend on the model's complexity, sample size, the quality and differences in feature maps, and differences in the models across domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework for digital twin technology called "ANSR-DT." Digital twins in industrial environments often struggle with interpretability, real-time adaptation, and human input integration. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining CNN-LSTM dynamic event detection with reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning to enable adaptive intelligence with interpretable decision processes. This integration enhances environmental understanding while promoting continuous learning, leading to more effective real-time decision-making in human-machine collaborative applications. We evaluated ANSR-DT on synthetic industrial data, observing significant improvements over traditional approaches, with up to 99.5% accuracy for dynamic pattern recognition. The framework demonstrated superior adaptability with extended reinforcement learning training, improving explained variance from 0.447 to 0.547. Future work aims at scaling to larger datasets to test rule management beyond the current 14 rules. Our open-source implementation promotes reproducibility and establishes a foundation for future research in adaptive, interpretable digital twins for industrial applications.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation is considered an effective method to achieve coherence (within a forecast hierarchy) and to improve forecast quality. However, the value of reconciled forecasts in downstream decision-making tasks has been mostly overlooked. In a multi-agent setup with heterogeneous loss functions, this oversight may lead to unfair outcomes, hence resulting in conflicts during the reconciliation process. To address this, we propose a value-oriented forecast reconciliation approach that focuses on the forecast value for all individual agents. Fairness is ensured through the use of a Nash bargaining framework. Specifically, we model this problem as a cooperative bargaining game, where each agent aims to optimize their own gain while contributing to the overall reconciliation process. We then present a primal-dual algorithm for parameter estimation based on empirical risk minimization. From an application perspective, we consider an aggregated wind energy trading problem, where profits are distributed using a weighted allocation rule. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several numerical experiments, showing that it consistently results in increased profits for all agents involved.

Abstract: Although backpropagation is widely accepted as a training algorithm for artificial neural networks, researchers are always looking for inspiration from the brain to find ways with potentially better performance. Forward-Forward is a novel training algorithm that is more similar to what occurs in the brain, although there is a significant performance gap compared to backpropagation. In the Forward-Forward algorithm, the loss functions are placed after each layer, and the updating of a layer is done using two local forward passes and one local backward pass. Forward-Forward is in its early stages and has been designed and evaluated on simple multi-layer perceptron networks to solve image classification tasks. In this work, we have extended the use of this algorithm to a more complex and modern network, namely the Vision Transformer. Inspired by insights from contrastive learning, we have attempted to revise this algorithm, leading to the introduction of Contrastive Forward-Forward. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline Forward-Forward leading to an increase of up to 10% in accuracy and accelerating the convergence speed by 5 to 20 times. Furthermore, if we take Cross Entropy as the baseline loss function in backpropagation, it will be demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the baseline Forward-Forward reduce its performance gap compared to backpropagation on Vision Transformer, and even outperforms it in certain conditions, such as inaccurate supervision.

Abstract: Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce SpeechShield, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of SpeechShield hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement SpeechShield on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. SpeechShield with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. SpeechShield is 16x smaller in memory, 3.3x faster and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.

Abstract: Decoding neural activity into human-interpretable representations is a key research direction in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and computational neuroscience. Recent progress in machine learning and generative AI has driven growing interest in transforming non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) signals into images, text, and audio. This survey consolidates and analyzes developments across EEG-to-image synthesis, EEG-to-text generation, and EEG-to-audio reconstruction. We conducted a structured literature search across major databases (2017-2025), extracting key information on datasets, generative architectures (GANs, VAEs, transformers, diffusion models), EEG feature-encoding techniques, evaluation metrics, and the major challenges shaping current work in this area. Our review finds that EEG-to-image models predominantly employ encoder-decoder architectures built on GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models; EEG-to-text approaches increasingly leverage transformer-based language models for open-vocabulary decoding; and EEG-to-audio methods commonly map EEG signals to mel-spectrograms that are subsequently rendered into audio using neural vocoders. Despite promising advances, the field remains constrained by small and heterogeneous datasets, limited cross-subject generalization, and the absence of standardized benchmarks. By consolidating methodological trends and available datasets, this survey provides a foundational reference for advancing EEG-based generative AI and supporting reproducible research. We further highlight open-source datasets and baseline implementations to facilitate systematic benchmarking and accelerate progress in EEG-driven neural decoding.

Abstract: We analyse the convergence of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks trained by gradient flow on $n$ data points. Our main contribution leverages the high dimensionality of the ambient space, which implies low correlation of the input samples, to demonstrate that a network with width of order $\log(n)$ neurons suffices for global convergence with high probability. Our analysis uses a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz viewpoint along the gradient-flow trajectory, which provides an exponential rate of convergence of $\frac{1}{n}$. When the data are exactly orthogonal, we give further refined characterizations of the convergence speed, proving its asymptotic behavior lies between the orders $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and exhibiting a phase-transition phenomenon in the convergence rate, during which it evolves from the lower bound to the upper, and in a relative time of order $\frac{1}{\log(n)}$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate survey responses, but synthetic data can be misaligned with the human population, leading to unreliable inference. We develop a general framework that converts LLM-simulated responses into reliable confidence sets for population parameters of human responses, addressing the distribution shift between the simulated and real populations. The key design choice is the number of simulated responses: too many produce overly narrow sets with poor coverage, while too few yield excessively loose estimates. We propose a data-driven approach that adaptively selects the simulation sample size to achieve nominal average-case coverage, regardless of the LLM's simulation fidelity or the confidence set construction procedure. The selected sample size is further shown to reflect the effective human population size that the LLM can represent, providing a quantitative measure of its simulation fidelity. Experiments on real survey datasets reveal heterogeneous fidelity gaps across different LLMs and domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with computational efficiency and error propagation in multi-step reasoning tasks. While recent advancements on prompting and post-training have enabled LLMs to perform step-wise reasoning, they still tend to explore unproductive solution paths without effective backtracking or strategy adjustment. In this paper, we propose Meta-Reasoner, a new framework that empowers LLMs to "think about how to think". It optimizes the inference process by dynamically adapting reasoning strategies in real-time. Our approach employs contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) to learn an adaptive policy. It learns to evaluate the current state of LLM's reasoning and determine optimal strategy that is most likely to lead to a successful outcome during inference, like whether to backtrack, switch to a new approach, or restart the problem-solving process. This meta-guidance helps avoid unproductive paths exploration during inference and hence improves computational efficiency. We evaluate Meta-Reasoner on math problems (e.g., Game-of-24, TheoremQA) and scientific tasks (e.g., SciBench). Results show that our method outperform previous SOTA methods by 9-12\% in accuracy, while reducing inference time by 28-35\% under the same compute budget. Additional experiments on creative writing demonstrate the generalizability of our approach to diverse reasoning-intensive tasks.

<title>A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce erroneous code. Rather than repairing outputs, a more thorough remedy is to address underlying model failures. LM repair offers a lightweight solution: it requires minimal data, lowers computational cost, and limits side effects. Unlike full retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it suitable for limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a novel semantic-based optimization method for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and standard optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. By reformulating LM repair as an optimization process, STAR may solve multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR demonstrates superior effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art. Besides, STAR exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact. Further, we analyzed the differences with pipeline-based methods and explained the reason why STAR is better and how it mitigated the common limitations of LM repair.

Abstract: Assessing the safety of autonomous driving policy is of great importance, and reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for discovering critical vulnerabilities in driving policies. However, existing RL-based approaches often struggle to identify vulnerabilities that are both effective-meaning the autonomous vehicle is genuinely responsible for the accidents-and diverse-meaning they span various failure types. To address these challenges, we propose AED, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover effective and diverse vulnerabilities in autonomous driving policies. We first utilize an LLM to automatically design reward functions for RL training. Then we let the LLM consider a diverse set of accident types and train adversarial policies for different accident types in parallel. Finally, we use preference-based learning to filter ineffective accidents and enhance the effectiveness of each vulnerability. Experiments across multiple simulated traffic scenarios and tested policies show that AED uncovers a broader range of vulnerabilities and achieves higher attack success rates compared with expert-designed rewards, thereby reducing the need for manual reward engineering and improving the diversity and effectiveness of vulnerability discovery. The implementation can be found on: https://github.com/thu-nics/AED .

Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful architecture at the intersection of machine learning and control, featuring layers composed of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems followed by pointwise nonlinearities. These models combine the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the interpretability and inductive bias of dynamical systems, offering strong performance on long-sequence tasks with favorable computational complexity. However, their adoption in applications such as system identification and optimal control remains limited by the difficulty of enforcing stability and robustness in a principled and tractable manner.
  We introduce L2RU, a class of SSMs endowed with a prescribed $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain bound, guaranteeing input--output stability and robustness for all parameter values. The L2RU architecture is derived from free parametrizations of LTI systems satisfying an $\mathcal{L}_2$ constraint, enabling unconstrained optimization via standard gradient-based methods while preserving rigorous stability guarantees. Specifically, we develop two complementary parametrizations: a non-conservative formulation that provides a complete characterization of square LTI systems with a given $\mathcal{L}_2$-bound, and a conservative formulation that extends the approach to general (possibly non-square) systems while improving computational efficiency through a structured representation of the system matrices.
  Both parametrizations admit efficient initialization schemes that facilitate training long-memory models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a nonlinear system identification benchmark, where L2RU achieves improved performance and training stability compared to existing SSM architectures, highlighting its potential as a principled and robust building block for learning and control.

Abstract: The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy.

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a novel resource-efficient learning framework is introduced for beam prediction, which leverages a custom-designed cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD) algorithm specifically tailored for beam prediction tasks, to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a radar-only student model, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.

Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.

Abstract: To achieve successful assistance with long-horizon web-based tasks, AI agents must be able to sequentially follow real-world user instructions over a long period. Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, but prior work has largely targeted conditions where diagnosis is relatively straightforward. More challenging problems remain underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. These lesions are difficult to diagnose due to subtle imaging features, often necessitating invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). We introduce ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and present a deep learning framework for Bankart lesion detection on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI contains shoulder MRIs from patients who underwent arthroscopy, providing ground-truth labels from intraoperative findings, the diagnostic gold standard. Separate models were trained for MRIs and MRAs using CNN- and transformer-based architectures, with predictions ensembled across multiple imaging planes. Our models achieved radiologist-level performance, with accuracy on standard MRIs surpassing radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation on independent hospital data demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluation, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and foster development of datasets and models that address clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.

Our evaluation results demonstrate the high quality and effectiveness of this method. Additionally, we show that applying discrete optimal transport as a post-processing step in audio generation can lead to the incorrect classification of synthetic audio as real.

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through \textit{function vectors} (FVs), recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize FVs to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task promptings forms do not induce a common task representation through FVs but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression in their training data. Drawing on both machine learning and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we extend a recent probabilistic extraction technique to measure memorization of 50 books in 17 open-weight LLMs. Through thousands of experiments, we show that the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With respect to our specific extraction methodology, we find that most LLMs do not memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B entirely memorizes some books, like the first Harry Potter book and 1984. In fact, the first Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first few tokens of the first chapter, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.

<title>PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing</title>

Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/PhySense.

Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models (SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally, we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.

<title>Overfitting has a limitation: a model-independent generalization gap bound based on R\'enyi entropy</title>

Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization gap, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization gap behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization gap applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization gap can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.

Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round. We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses, we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$ by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents -particularly as task and agent sophistication increase- requires more than simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal foraging- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed, quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show that studying DRL agents like animals -analyzing them with neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural dynamics- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI will be essential- not just for understanding their behavior, but for ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Abstract: We address key challenges in Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for real-world contact-rich manipulation: how to collect informative human correction data and how to effectively update policies with this new data. We introduce Compliant Residual DAgger (CR-DAgger), which contains two novel components: 1) a Compliant Intervention Interface that leverages compliance control, allowing humans to provide gentle, accurate delta action corrections without interrupting the ongoing robot policy execution; and 2) a Compliant Residual Policy formulation that learns from human corrections while incorporating force feedback and force control. Our system significantly enhances performance on precise contact-rich manipulation tasks using minimal correction data, improving base policy success rates by over 50\% on two challenging tasks (book flipping and belt assembly) while outperforming both retraining-from-scratch and finetuning approaches. Through extensive real-world experiments, we provide practical guidance for implementing effective DAgger in real-world robot learning tasks.

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet.

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of Earth systems are coarse, and Earth observations are sparse and gappy. We apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. Two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider multiple test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantifications of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that the generated super-resolution fields of SDEdit are unphysical, while those of DPS are reasonable but with smoothed fine-scale features; however, neither of these lower-cost models propagates observational information effectively to unobserved regions. The two conditional models require re-training, but reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and predict correct turbulence statistics, including the tails. Further, their mean errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the tradeoffs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment.

Abstract: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a good secure shuffler?
  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers, offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.

<title>AI Should Sense Better, Not Just Scale Bigger: Adaptive Sensing as a Paradigm Shift</title>

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input (e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods. Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: We derive a new class of non-linear expectations from first-principles deterministic chaotic dynamics. The homogenization of the system's skew-adjoint microscopic generator is achieved using the spectral theory of transfer operators for uniformly hyperbolic flows. We prove convergence in the viscosity sense to a macroscopic evolution governed by a fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Our central result establishes that the HJB Hamiltonian possesses a rigid structure: affine in the Hessian but demonstrably non-convex in the gradient. This defines a new $\theta$-expectation and constructively establishes a class of non-convex stochastic control problems fundamentally outside the sub-additive framework of G-expectations.

<title>MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999</link>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.

<title>Beyond Linearity and Time-Homogeneity: Relational Hyper Event Models with Time-Varying Non-Linear Effects</title>

Abstract: Recent technological advances have made it easier to collect large and complex networks of time-stamped relational events connecting two or more entities. Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of these events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on past history and external information.
  However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches still rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the effects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying and non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take this further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor product smooths.
  We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In particular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and impact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic factors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential non-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.

Abstract: We prove that the detection rate of n-crossing alternating links by many standard link invariants decays exponentially in n, implying that they detect alternating links with probability zero. This phenomenon applies broadly, in particular to the Jones and HOMFLYPT polynomials and integral Khovanov homology. We also use a big-data approach to analyze knots and provide evidence that, for knots as well, these invariants exhibit the same asymptotic failure of detection.

Abstract: In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the platform and increasing costs. Traditional keyword-based search methodologies falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss. Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding 200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of 0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.

<title>Multi-Scenario Highway Lane-Change Intention Prediction: A Physics-Informed AI Framework for Three-Class Classification</title>

Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.

<title>Sharpness of Minima in Deep Matrix Factorization: Exact Expressions</title>

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). This expression uncovers a fundamental property of the loss landscape of depth-2 matrix factorization problems: a minimum is flat if and only if it is spectral-norm balanced, which implies that flat minima are not necessarily Frobenius-norm balanced. Furthermore, to complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack object-level control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce KineMask, an approach for video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predicted scene descriptions, leading to support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Our experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.

<title>SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at https://github.com/Buyun-Liang/SECA.

<title>The Hidden DNA of LLM-Generated JavaScript: Structural Patterns Enable High-Accuracy Authorship Attribution</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications. Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks, surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.

<title>Capturing Context-Aware Route Choice Semantics for Trajectory Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectory data into low-dimensional embeddings for downstream tasks such as travel time estimation, mobility prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. From a behavioral perspective, a trajectory reflects a sequence of route choices within an urban environment. However, most existing TRL methods ignore this underlying decision-making process and instead treat trajectories as static, passive spatiotemporal sequences, thereby limiting the semantic richness of the learned representations. To bridge this gap, we propose CORE, a TRL framework that integrates context-aware route choice semantics into trajectory embeddings. CORE first incorporates a multi-granular Environment Perception Module, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to distill environmental semantics from point of interest (POI) distributions, thereby constructing a context-enriched road network. Building upon this backbone, CORE employs a Route Choice Encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which captures route choice patterns by jointly leveraging the context-enriched road network and navigational factors. Finally, a Transformer encoder aggregates the route-choice-aware representations into a global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets across 6 downstream tasks demonstrate that CORE consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art TRL methods, achieving an average improvement of 9.79% over the best-performing baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoji2001/CORE.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present Calgacus, a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

<title>DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning</title>

arXiv:2510.23907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.

Abstract: Generating automated reports for 3D positron emission tomography (PET) is an important and challenging task in medical imaging. PET plays a vital role in oncology, but automating report generation is difficult due to the complexity of whole-body 3D volumes, the wide range of potential clinical findings, and the limited availability of annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce PETARSeg-11K, the first large-scale, publicly available dataset that provides lesion-level correspondence between 3D PET/CT volumes and free-text radiological findings. It comprises 11,356 lesion descriptions paired with 3D segmentations. Second, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D vision-language model designed for mask-aware, spatially grounded PET/CT reporting. PETAR-4B jointly encodes PET, CT, and 3D lesion segmentation masks, using a 3D focal prompt to capture fine-grained details of lesions that normally comprise less than 0.1% of the volume. Evaluations using automated metrics show PETAR-4B substantially outperforming all 2D and 3D baselines. A human study involving five physicians -- the first of its kind for automated PET reporting -- confirms the model's clinical utility and establishes correlations between automated metrics and expert judgment. This work provides a foundational dataset and a novel architecture, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding in PET.

<title>A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI</title>

Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database, and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps, and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow, Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors - coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to 44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

Abstract: Missing data is a fundamental challenge in data science, significantly hindering analysis and decision-making across a wide range of disciplines, including healthcare, bioinformatics, social science, e-commerce, and industrial monitoring. Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful general-purpose policies for robotic manipulation, benefiting from large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, they often fail to generalize reliably in out-of-distribution deployments, where unavoidable disturbances such as observation noise, sensor errors, or actuation perturbations become prevalent. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training provides a practical means to adapt pre-trained VLA models, existing methods mainly emphasize reward maximization and overlook robustness to environmental uncertainty. In this work, we introduce RobustVLA, a lightweight online RL post-training method designed to explicitly enhance the resilience of VLA models. Through a systematic robustness analysis, we identify two key regularizations: Jacobian regularization, which mitigates sensitivity to observation noise, and smoothness regularization, which stabilizes policies under action perturbations. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic environments demonstrate that RobustVLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reliability. Our results highlight the importance of principled robustness-aware RL post-training as a key step toward improving the reliability and robustness of VLA models.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

<title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Correlated Spiked Models</title>

Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked matrices $$ X=\tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xu^{\top}+W, \quad Y=\tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yv^{\top}+Z $$ where the spikes $x,y$ have correlation $\rho$. Specifically, we consider two fundamental models: (1) Correlated spiked Wigner model with signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda,\mu$; (2) Correlated spiked $n*N$ Wishart (covariance) model with signal-to-noise ratio $\sqrt\lambda,\sqrt\mu$.
  We propose an efficient detection and estimation algorithm based on counting a specific family of edge-decorated cycles. The algorithm's performance is governed by the function $$ F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\gamma)=\max\Big\{ \frac{ \lambda^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \mu^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,. $$ We prove our algorithm succeeds for the correlated spiked Wigner model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)>1$, and succeeds for the correlated spiked Wishart model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})>1$. Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from ${X}$ alone or $y$ from ${Y}$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic results with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)<1$ for the correlated spiked Wigner model and when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})<1$ for the spiked Wishart model, all algorithms based on low-degree polynomials fails to distinguish $({X},{Y})$ with two independent noise matrices. This strongly suggests that $F=1$ is the precise computation threshold for our models.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Abstract: The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\eta>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\rho_k^\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\eta$. We show that $\rho_k^\eta$ are approximated to order $\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a modified energy \[ J^{\eta}(\rho) = J(\rho) - \frac{\eta}{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{\delta J}{\delta \rho} (\rho) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,\rho(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\eta$ a deceleration in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{\"a}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\eta$ we study JKO-Flow, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\eta$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

<div> Keywords: Adaptive Resonance Theory, clustering, continual learning, dynamic data, hyperparameter-free

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses clustering challenges in both stationary and nonstationary data settings, where data distributions are either static or evolve over time. The authors propose a novel clustering algorithm based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) that incorporates a topological clustering approach. A key innovation is the introduction of a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism, which autonomously adjusts critical hyperparameters—specifically the recalculation interval and vigilance threshold. This enables the model to perform hyperparameter-free learning, which is crucial for maintaining cluster stability and continuity in dynamic environments where data distributions shift. The adaptive adjustments help mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a common problem in continual learning scenarios, thereby preserving previously learned cluster structures while adapting to new data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is empirically validated through experiments conducted on 24 real-world datasets. Results demonstrate superior clustering performance and continual learning capability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to its robust performance, the method’s adaptability enhances its utility for evolving data streams where maintaining consistent clustering is essential. The authors also provide access to their source code for reproducibility and further research at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

<div> Keywords: recipe recommendation, multimodal features, foundation models, message propagation, contrastive learning<br /><br />Summary: Recipe recommendation on web-based food platforms is challenging primarily because it requires effective use of rich multimodal features beyond simple user-recipe interactions. This study identifies that even straightforward incorporation of these multimodal signals yields competitive outcomes, emphasizing the potential of more systematic improvements. To address this, the authors propose TESMR, a novel three-stage framework that refines raw multimodal features into more effective embeddings through progressive enhancement steps. The first stage, content-based enhancement, leverages foundation models equipped with multimodal understanding to enrich feature representations. The second stage, relation-based enhancement, applies message propagation techniques over user-recipe interaction graphs to capture relational information. The final stage, learning-based enhancement, utilizes contrastive learning with learnable embeddings to further optimize feature quality. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two real-world recipe datasets demonstrate that TESMR consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the approach achieves a significant improvement in recommendation performance, with 7-15% higher Recall@10 metrics compared to baseline models. This work highlights the importance of systematic multimodal feature exploitation and presents TESMR as an effective framework for advancing recipe recommendation systems. <div>

This new approach addresses the slowness and instability commonly found in standard samplers that require many sampling steps for high-quality outputs. ProxT2I leverages reinforcement learning and policy optimization to fine-tune samplers according to task-specific rewards, enhancing both efficiency and alignment with human preferences. To support training and evaluation, the authors also present LAION-Face-T2I-15M, a new large-scale, open-source dataset consisting of 15 million high-quality human images paired with detailed captions. Experimentally, the method demonstrates superior sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines. Furthermore, ProxT2I matches the results of current state-of-the-art open-source text-to-image models while demanding less computational power and utilizing a smaller model size. Overall, the approach offers a lightweight, efficient, and effective solution for human-centered text-to-image generation, potentially broadening accessibility in practical applications. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.

<div> Methane, greenhouse gas, satellite detection, machine learning, emissions mitigation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Methane significantly contributes to global warming, accounting for approximately 30% of the increase since pre-industrial times. Large methane emissions are often concentrated at a few major point sources, presenting an opportunity for targeted emission reductions by addressing a limited number of sites. Detecting and attributing these emissions at scale remains complex, particularly for issuing timely notifications to asset owners. The study introduces MARS-S2L, a machine learning model designed to identify methane emissions using publicly available multispectral satellite imagery. This model was trained on a large, manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images, enabling high-resolution and frequent detection every two days. MARS-S2L achieved detection of 78% of methane plumes with an 8% false positive rate across 697 previously unseen sites. Operational deployment of MARS-S2L has resulted in issuance of 1,015 notifications across 20 countries, facilitating verified and permanent mitigation of six persistent methane emitters, including a newly discovered site in Libya. These findings highlight a scalable and effective approach that connects satellite-based detection directly to actionable methane reduction efforts at the facility level. <div>

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for roughly 30\% of warming since pre-industrial times. A small number of large point sources account for a disproportionate share of emissions, creating an opportunity for substantial reductions by targeting relatively few sites. Detection and attribution of large emissions at scale for notification to asset owners remains challenging. Here, we introduce MARS-S2L, a machine learning model that detects methane emissions in publicly available multispectral satellite imagery. Trained on a manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images, the model provides high-resolution detections every two days, enabling facility-level attribution and identifying 78\% of plumes with an 8\% false positive rate at 697 previously unseen sites. Deployed operationally, MARS-S2L has issued 1,015 notifications to stakeholders in 20 countries, enabling verified, permanent mitigation of six persistent emitters, including a previously unknown site in Libya. These results demonstrate a scalable pathway from satellite detection to quantifiable methane mitigation.

<div> Keywords: Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Spiking Neural Networks, Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, Conservative Flux Quantization, Mass Conservation<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices, which is crucial for embodied AI systems. It highlights the limitations of existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which are energy-intensive and often fail to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Central to this framework is the design of the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, which intrinsically guarantees local mass preservation through its dynamics. Additionally, a Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy is proposed to improve temporal generalization by interpreting neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. This approach enables the PISNN to learn a time-invariant physical evolution operator, making it a conservative-by-construction general-purpose solver. The effectiveness of the PISNN is validated through experiments on the 1D heat equation and 2D Laplace’s equation, where it demonstrates accurate system dynamics simulation alongside perfect mass conservation—a challenging goal for traditional PINNs. This work bridges scientific computing rigor with neuromorphic efficiency, setting the foundation for long-term, energy-efficient, and physically faithful predictions in intelligent edge AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices is critical for the next generation embodied AI systems, yet it remains a major challenge. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs. This work establishes a robust framework for fusing the rigor of scientific computing with the efficiency of neuromorphic engineering, paving the way for complex, long-term, and energy-efficient physics predictions for intelligent systems.

<div> Keywords: Implicit Neural Representations, spectral bias, dynamical system, expressivity, generalization<br /><br />Summary: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) excel at modeling continuous visual and geometric signals but face challenges from spectral bias, which limits their capacity to represent high-frequency details effectively. This paper introduces Dynamical Implicit Neural Representations (DINR), a novel framework that conceptualizes feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system rather than a conventional layer-based architecture. By doing so, DINR alleviates spectral bias, allowing for richer and more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature changes. Theoretical insights grounded in Rademacher complexity and Neural Tangent Kernel analyses reveal that DINR improves model expressivity and enhances the dynamics of training. Importantly, the framework includes a regularization mechanism on the complexity of the underlying dynamics, offering a principled approach to balance the trade-off between expressivity and generalization. Extensive empirical evaluations illustrate that DINR achieves more stable convergence rates, yields higher fidelity signal reconstructions, and outperforms traditional static INRs in generalization tasks across domains such as image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a powerful continuous framework for modeling complex visual and geometric signals, but spectral bias remains a fundamental challenge, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details. Orthogonal to existing remedy strategies, we introduce Dynamical Implicit Neural Representations (DINR), a new INR modeling framework that treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system rather than a discrete stack of layers. This dynamical formulation mitigates spectral bias by enabling richer, more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature evolution. Theoretical analysis based on Rademacher complexity and the Neural Tangent Kernel demonstrates that DINR enhances expressivity and improves training dynamics. Moreover, regularizing the complexity of the underlying dynamics provides a principled way to balance expressivity and generalization. Extensive experiments on image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression confirm that DINR delivers more stable convergence, higher signal fidelity, and stronger generalization than conventional static INRs.

<div> Keywords: multiclass classification, threshold tuning, multidimensional simplex, ROC analysis, Distance From Point (DFP) score  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper proposes a novel threshold-based framework for multiclass classification which extends beyond the traditional argmax decision rule. Instead of relying solely on the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs, the method uses a geometric interpretation on the multidimensional simplex, introducing a multidimensional threshold for classification decisions. This novel perspective allows for an \textit{a posteriori} optimization of classification scores through threshold tuning, a technique commonly used in binary classification but less explored in the multiclass context. The approach enables refinement of prediction performance of any pre-trained classification network without retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that tuning multidimensional thresholds consistently improves performance across various neural network architectures and datasets. Furthermore, the paper introduces a new multiclass ROC analysis framework based on what the authors call "ROC clouds," representing attainable (False Positive Rate, True Positive Rate) operating points generated by a single multiclass threshold. To summarize these ROC clouds, a metric called Distance From Point (DFP) to the ideal operating point (0,1) is defined, offering a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest ROC curves. The DFP score also correlates with the observed performance gains from threshold tuning, providing insights into classifier behavior and tuning benefits. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained classification network an \textit{a posteriori} optimization of the classification score by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting, thus allowing for a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network. Our experiments show indeed that multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. Moreover, we derive a multiclass ROC analysis based on \emph{ROC clouds} -- the attainable (FPR,TPR) operating points induced by a single multiclass threshold -- and summarize them via a \emph{Distance From Point} (DFP) score to $(0,1)$. This yields a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest (OvR) curves and aligns with the observed tuning gains.

<div> Rashomon set, robustness, privacy, interpretable models, information leakage  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines typically yield not just a single optimal model but a Rashomon set—a collection of many near-optimal models. This multiplicity significantly affects trustworthiness in ML. First, at the individual model level, sparse and interpretable models often help preserve privacy but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their fragility. Second, the diversity inherent in a large Rashomon set fosters reactive robustness, meaning that even if one model falls victim to an attack, others in the set usually maintain accuracy and reliability. Third, Rashomon sets show stability when faced with small shifts in data distribution, enhancing their practical utility. However, this diversity introduces a privacy risk: revealing multiple near-optimal models can increase information leakage, as attackers gain richer insights into the training data by analyzing these models collectively. Through a blend of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments focusing on sparse decision trees and linear models, the study characterizes this critical trade-off between robustness and privacy within Rashomon sets. Ultimately, Rashomon sets embody a dual nature, serving as both a valuable resource for building trustworthy ML systems and a potential risk factor concerning privacy and information security. <div>

Abstract: Real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines rarely produce a single model; instead, they produce a Rashomon set of many near-optimal ones. We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage, as disclosing more near-optimal models provides an attacker with progressively richer views of the training data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models, we characterize this robustness-privacy trade-off and highlight the dual role of Rashomon sets as both a resource and a risk for trustworthy ML.

<div> Keywords: Internet of Things, Anomaly Detection, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Cybersecurity

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IoT deployments due to their rapid proliferation. Traditional signature-based anomaly detection systems struggle to identify emerging and zero-day threats, highlighting the need for more effective unsupervised techniques. The research evaluates two such methods—Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM)—using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. Performance was assessed through key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results show that Isolation Forest consistently outperforms OC-SVM by delivering higher accuracy, superior precision and recall, and a significantly better F1-score. Additionally, IF demonstrated a more efficient computational footprint, which is critical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices common in IoT settings. The findings emphasize the robustness of Isolation Forest in handling high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT data, making it highly suitable for real-time anomaly detection. This research underscores the practical applicability of Isolation Forest for enhancing IoT cybersecurity by effectively detecting threats while maintaining low resource consumption. <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across diverse sectors has significantly enhanced operational efficiency, yet concurrently elevated cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to increased exposure to cyber threats. Given the limitations of traditional signature-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS) in identifying emerging and zero-day threats, this study investigates the effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score. Furthermore, Isolation Forest demonstrated a markedly superior computational footprint, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. These findings underscore Isolation Forest's robustness in high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT environments and highlight its practical viability for real-time anomaly detection.

<div> Keywords: sensorimotor transformations, musculoskeletal model, imitation learning, energy constraints, biomechanics<br /><br />Summary:  
This article presents the development of a general-purpose simulation platform aimed at understanding embodied control by modeling sensorimotor transformations that link brain activity to body movement. The authors describe a pipeline that converts kinematic data from neuroscience experiments into biomechanical models that can replicate natural mouse forelimb movements. To achieve this, they implement an imitation learning framework that trains a musculoskeletal model to perform dexterous reaching tasks within a physics-based simulation environment. The training process is accelerated using GPU capabilities via JAX and Mujoco-MJX, achieving over one million training steps per second. A key finding is that incorporating biologically inspired constraints, such as energy expenditure and velocity limits, into the simulations produces musculoskeletal activity patterns that better correspond to actual electromyography (EMG) recordings. This suggests that energy efficiency and control limitations are important factors in accurately modeling motor control. Overall, the work bridges neuroscience data, biomechanics, and computational modeling to enhance our understanding of how the brain controls movement through complex neural and musculoskeletal interactions. <div>

Abstract: The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

<div> XGBoost, air quality, regression, model efficiency, IoT

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study evaluates two variants of the XGBoost regression model—a full-capacity version and a lightweight (tiny) version—for predicting urban air pollutant concentrations, specifically carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The AirQualityUCI dataset, representing one year of data in an urban environment, was used for the analysis. Model performance was assessed using standard predictive accuracy metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). Alongside accuracy, resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage were also examined. Results showed the full XGBoost model provided superior accuracy in predicting pollutant levels, while the tiny model, despite slightly diminished precision, significantly reduced computational resource demands. This reduction manifested as much faster inference times and smaller model storage requirements. The findings highlight that simplified XGBoost models maintain acceptable predictive quality while enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, the tiny XGBoost variant is particularly well-suited for real-time air quality monitoring applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded system contexts, where computational resources and storage are limited. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of two variants of the XGBoost regression model, the full-capacity and lightweight (tiny) versions, for predicting the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Using the AirQualityUCI dataset collected over one year in an urban environment, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on widely accepted metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, we assessed resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. The full XGBoost model achieved superior predictive accuracy for both pollutants, while the tiny model, though slightly less precise, offered substantial computational benefits with significantly reduced inference time and model storage requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying simplified models in resource-constrained environments without compromising predictive quality. This makes the tiny XGBoost model suitable for real-time air-quality monitoring in IoT and embedded applications.

Keywords: PDE-FM, physics-informed machine learning, neural operators, multi-physics simulation, foundation model  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper presents PDE-FM, a modular foundation model designed for physics-informed machine learning that integrates spatial, spectral, and temporal reasoning across diverse partial differential equation (PDE) systems. PDE-FM features a combination of spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone coupled with an operator-theoretic decoder, which together enable scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. Unlike task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM undergoes a single pretraining phase on a variety of PDE datasets, facilitating seamless transfer to new physical regimes without requiring architectural or data-specific adjustments. The model was evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark, covering hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena, and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains. It demonstrated a significant reduction in mean VRMSE by 46% compared to previous operator-learning baselines. Additionally, PDE-FM showed robust cross-physics generalization capabilities, excelling particularly in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong accuracy in linear and steady-state scenarios. The study highlights that large-scale pretraining on diverse physical processes can generate transferable dynamic representations, advancing toward unified foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and accelerating scientific discovery. <div>

PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes. These results suggest that large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes can yield transferable representations of dynamics, marking a step toward unified, foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.

<div> Keywords: autoregressive transformers, closed-loop prediction, Equilibrium Transformers, energy-based model, latent refinement  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper identifies a fundamental limitation in contemporary autoregressive transformers, which operate in an open-loop manner—computing hidden states in a single forward pass without revision—leading to error propagation in tasks requiring long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To overcome this, the authors propose the closed-loop prediction principle, where the model iteratively refines latent states until achieving self-consistent equilibrium before generating each token. They instantiate this idea through Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which integrate an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via latent space gradient descent. This energy function enforces bidirectional consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence without external supervision. Theoretically, EqT is shown to perform approximate MAP inference in an energy-based latent model with linear convergence guarantees. The refinement process particularly improves performance on difficult inputs where one-shot inference fails. Their framework unifies several approaches, including deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate average improvements of 3.28%, with gains up to 8.07% on sequences where standard transformers perform near chance, confirming that deliberation yields more benefits as task difficulty rises. The approach is proposed as a foundational advance toward resolving the commitment bottleneck in autoregressive language models. <div>
arXiv:2511.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.

<div> Keywords: Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder, Expectation-Maximization, spectral interpretability metric, latent clustering, physical systems<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article proposes a novel Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GM-VAE) framework aimed at extracting compact and physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data with complex nonlinear structures. Unlike traditional VAEs that optimize reconstruction and clustering jointly, often causing training instability, their method employs an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-inspired block-coordinate descent strategy that alternates between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes, improving interpretability. To objectively assess the quality of the learned latent representations, the authors introduce a new spectral interpretability metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which quantifies the coherence of physical quantities over the latent manifold. The framework is validated on progressively complex datasets including surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images. Results demonstrate that the GM-VAE produces smooth and physically consistent latent manifolds alongside accurate regime clustering. Overall, the method offers a robust, data-driven tool for analyzing and interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems, addressing long-standing challenges in linking high-dimensional data to underlying physical behaviors through stable and interpretable latent representations. <div>

Abstract: Extracting compact, physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data is a persistent challenge due to the complex, nonlinear structures inherent in physical systems. We propose a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GM-VAE) framework designed to address this by integrating an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-inspired training scheme with a novel spectral interpretability metric. Unlike conventional VAEs that jointly optimize reconstruction and clustering (often leading to training instability), our method utilizes a block-coordinate descent strategy, alternating between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes. To objectively evaluate the learned representations, we introduce a quantitative metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which measures the coherence of physical quantities across the latent manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on datasets of increasing complexity: surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images. The results show that our GM-VAE yields smooth, physically consistent manifolds and accurate regime clustering, offering a robust data-driven tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems.

<div> Keywords: multimodal machine learning, data fusion, BERT, vision networks, latency-accuracy tradeoff  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the impact of different fusion strategies in multimodal machine learning, focusing on combining image and text data using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework. Two vision networks, MobileNetV2 and ViT, serve as the image processing modules. For each vision network, the authors propose three fusion models that integrate data at early, intermediate, and late stages within the architecture. The models are evaluated on the CMU MOSI dataset to assess their accuracy and benchmarked on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX to measure inference latency. Findings indicate a clear tradeoff: late fusion achieves the highest accuracy by merging processed features at the end of the pipeline, while early fusion delivers the fastest inference times by consolidating data closer to input layers. Intermediate fusion models offer a balance between these extremes. The study highlights that the choice of fusion strategy should be aligned with the application's specific needs for accuracy versus latency. This work provides practical insights for designing multimodal models, emphasizing that integrating data earlier accelerates inference but typically reduces accuracy, whereas late fusion improves accuracy but at the cost of increased latency. <div>
arXiv:2511.21889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models often combine multiple input streams of data to more accurately capture the information that informs their decisions. In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency. We describe the three proposed model architectures and discuss the accuracy and latency tradeoffs, concluding that data fusion earlier in the model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy.

<div> multi-modal foundation models, adversarial illusions, generative models, Variational Autoencoders, cross-modal alignment<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Multi-modal foundation models integrate various data types like images and text into a shared embedding space but are susceptible to adversarial illusions, which involve subtle perturbations that disrupt this alignment and impair downstream tasks. To address this, the paper proposes a task-agnostic defense mechanism that reconstructs the original input from adversarially perturbed inputs using generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This reconstruction aims to restore natural cross-modal alignment. Additionally, the method incorporates a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation to enhance robustness by aggregating multiple reconstructions. Experiments conducted on state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, significantly reducing illusion attack success rates to nearly zero. Furthermore, the defense mechanism improves cross-modal alignment metrics by 4% (from 42 to 46) in unperturbed settings and by 11% (from 32 to 43) under perturbed conditions. The proposed method offers an effective, model-agnostic strategy to mitigate adversarial illusions, enhancing the reliability and security of multi-modal models in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.21893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal foundation models align images, text, and other modalities in a shared embedding space but remain vulnerable to adversarial illusions (Zhang et al., 2025), where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. To counteract the effects of adversarial illusions, we propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs the input from the attacker's perturbed input through generative models, e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to maintain natural alignment. To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders show that our approach substantially reduces the illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) and 11% (32 to 43) in unperturbed and perturbed input settings respectively, providing an effective and model-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions.

<div> electron density, voxel-based CNN, molecular property prediction, protein-ligand binding, quantum property modeling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study examines the use of electron density maps as voxel-based inputs for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in molecular property prediction tasks, contrasting these with traditional atom-based representations. Three voxel input types are evaluated: atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two tasks—protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). The volumetric nature of electron density maps aligns naturally with voxel grids, supporting both experimental and computational density data. On the protein-ligand affinity task, all input types show similar performance with large datasets; however, in low-data scenarios, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs on par, indicating the importance of spatial occupancy information in this context. For the quantum property task, where labels come from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities are derived from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs demonstrate superior accuracy at scale compared to atom-based inputs. This suggests electron density inputs carry richer structural and electronic information beneficial for quantum property modeling. Overall, the results underscore that the advantage of density-derived inputs depends on the specific task and data regime, enhancing data efficiency in binding affinity prediction and improving accuracy in quantum property prediction. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning models for 3D molecular property prediction typically rely on atom-based representations, which may overlook subtle physical information. Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.

<div> Keywords: human trust, AI prediction, galvanic skin response, facial emotion analysis, ADHD mHealth<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study addresses the prediction of human trust in AI systems within healthcare decision support, focusing on a simulated ADHD mobile health (mHealth) scenario. It introduces a multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates facial video data and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals to predict user trust in AI- versus human-generated recommendations. Facial videos were processed using OpenCV with a pre-trained transformer model to extract emotional features, while GSR data were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to assess physiological arousal. Trust prediction was performed separately for two temporal windows: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision making). Each data modality—image-based, GSR-based, and their combination—was analyzed with machine learning models. The best-performing unimodal models were combined in a multimodal stacking ensemble to improve accuracy. Results demonstrated that the multimodal approach significantly enhanced trust prediction, achieving an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and slightly lower metrics in the Proximal Detection Window. The findings highlight bio signals as effective real-time indicators of user trust, which can enable adaptive AI systems to adjust dynamically, maintaining calibrated trust critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment in mental health contexts. <div>

Abstract: Predicting human trust in AI systems is crucial for safe integration of AI-based decision support tools, especially in healthcare. This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

<div> Keywords: backdoor attacks, neural networks, Information Bottleneck, mutual information, stealthiness<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper provides a rigorous analysis of how backdoor data affects the training dynamics of neural networks, focusing on the differences between the target class and other clean classes. It leverages the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle linked with clustering in internal representations to study these effects. The authors discover that backdoor attacks leave unique mutual information (MI) signatures that evolve differently throughout training phases and vary according to the type of attack. A surprising trade-off is revealed: visually conspicuous attacks such as BadNets can be more stealthy in terms of information-theoretic integration within the model compared to many visually imperceptible attacks. Based on these insights, the paper introduces a novel dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies how well an attack is integrated at the model level. The proposed metric and findings are validated across multiple datasets and various attack types, providing a new perspective for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats in neural networks. The authors have also made their code publicly available to support further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics remains a complex and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Prompted Policy Search, Numerical Optimization, Sample Efficiency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach that integrates numerical reward signals with natural language input using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL methods which depend solely on scalar rewards, ProPS places an LLM at the core of the policy optimization loop, allowing the model to propose policy updates based on both numerical feedback and semantic information such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategic hints. ProPS leverages the LLM’s in-context numerical optimization ability to improve exploration and enhance sample efficiency. The method was evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, including classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo simulated environments. It was benchmarked against seven popular RL algorithms, including PPO, SAC, and TRPO. ProPS outperformed these baselines in over half of the tasks (eight out of fifteen) and showed significant performance improvements when enhanced with domain knowledge. The findings suggest that unifying semantic understanding with numeric RL signals can lead to more transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned reinforcement learning systems. This approach highlights the promise of combining linguistic reasoning and reward-driven learning to advance RL capabilities beyond traditional frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally relies on scalar reward signals, limiting its ability to leverage the rich semantic knowledge often available in real-world tasks. In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO). It outperforms all baselines on eight out of fifteen tasks and demonstrates substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of unifying semantics and numerics for transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned RL.

<div> Keywords: model-data alignment, feature importance, binary classification, interpretability, potential outcomes framework<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces a novel and computationally efficient framework designed to evaluate how well machine learning models align with the underlying structure of the data they are trained on. <br /><br />2.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework to evaluate whether machine learning models align with the structure of the data they learn from; that is, whether \textit{the model says what the data says}. Unlike existing interpretability methods that focus exclusively on explaining model behavior, our approach establishes a baseline derived directly from the data itself. Drawing inspiration from Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework, we quantify how strongly each feature separates the two outcome groups in a binary classification task, moving beyond traditional descriptive statistics to estimate each feature's effect on the outcome. By comparing these data-derived feature rankings against model-based explanations, we provide practitioners with an interpretable and model-agnostic method to assess model--data alignment.

<div> Quantum autoencoder, quantum support vector classification, IoT traffic, intrusion detection, NISQ devices  

<br /><br />Summary: This article addresses the escalating challenge of detecting anomalies in high-dimensional Internet of Things (IoT) traffic where classical methods fall short. It proposes a quantum machine learning framework combining a quantum autoencoder (QAE) for compressing network traffic into effective latent representations with a quantum support vector classification (QSVC) technique for intrusion detection. The framework was evaluated on three different datasets, demonstrating enhanced accuracy both in ideal quantum simulators and on real IBM Quantum hardware. Notably, the practical experiments reveal a quantum advantage achievable on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are available today. A key insight is that moderate depolarizing noise inherent in NISQ hardware works as an implicit regularizer, which stabilizes the training process and improves the model’s generalization capabilities. This finding indicates that quantum noise, often seen as a drawback, can be beneficial in quantum learning tasks. Overall, the work establishes quantum machine learning as a promising, practical, and hardware-ready solution to the pressing cybersecurity challenge of real-time intrusion detection, especially in complex, high-dimensional IoT environments where traditional approaches struggle to keep pace. <div>

Abstract: Escalating cyber threats and the high-dimensional complexity of IoT traffic have outpaced classical anomaly detection methods. While deep learning offers improvements, computational bottlenecks limit real-time deployment at scale. We present a quantum autoencoder (QAE) framework that compresses network traffic into discriminative latent representations and employs quantum support vector classification (QSVC) for intrusion detection. Evaluated on three datasets, our approach achieves improved accuracy on ideal simulators and on the IBM Quantum hardware demonstrating practical quantum advantage on current NISQ devices. Crucially, moderate depolarizing noise acts as implicit regularization, stabilizing training and enhancing generalization. This work establishes quantum machine learning as a viable, hardware-ready solution for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

<div> Keywords: feature transformation, multi-agent reinforcement learning, feature crossing, multi-head attention, shared critic mechanism<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of improving feature transformation for structured data, where deep learning models often underperform in capturing complex feature interactions. Existing automated methods frequently rely on heuristics or exhaustive searches, which are inefficient. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches improve upon this, but face two main issues: instability caused by dynamically expanding features during transformation and poor communication among agents leading to suboptimal feature crossing. To overcome these, the authors propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework with three agents divided into two types, each responsible for selecting critical features and operations. A shared critic mechanism is introduced to enhance communication among agents, facilitating better cooperation in feature crossing. Moreover, multi-head attention-based feature agents are designed to effectively handle the dynamically growing feature space by selecting appropriate features for crossing. A state encoding technique is developed to stabilize and improve RL agents’ learning dynamics, yielding more robust and reliable transformation policies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model’s effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability, indicating its potential for scalable and collaborative feature transformation in complex structured data tasks. <div>

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances downstream task performance by generating informative features through mathematical feature crossing. Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, repeated pricing games, human defection, algorithmic collusion, mixed ecosystems<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the dynamics of pricing in ecosystems where AI agents and humans interact repeatedly. The authors focus on a theoretical model based on repeated pricing games wherein AI agents follow equilibrium strategies to sustain supracompetitive prices. However, the presence of humans who manually set prices using no-regret strategies represents a form of defection from the AI-driven collusion. The main finding reveals that even a single human defector can destabilize the collusive equilibrium maintained by AI agents and significantly lower prices. As the number of human defectors increases, prices are pushed closer to competitive market levels, undermining AI-facilitated collusion. Furthermore, the study explores how AI agents that are defection-aware adapt their collusive strategies to such mixed ecosystems involving both humans and AI participants. This work characterizes the conditions under which algorithmic collusion remains robust or fragile, highlighting that collusion maintained by AI agents is vulnerable in environments where humans occasionally disrupt algorithmic strategies. The research contributes a theoretical understanding of the fragility and potential persistence of algorithmic collusion in human-AI interactive settings. <div>
arXiv:2511.21935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in ecosystems where they repeatedly interact not only with each other but also with humans. In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.

<div> Keywords: Brain-Computer Interfaces, Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials, deep learning, EEG decoding, Siamese networks<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of decoding Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) in non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) by proposing advanced deep learning methods to overcome temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. Various architectures were evaluated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, as well as Siamese networks leveraging similarity-based decoding methods. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used as a baseline for comparison. EEG data from 13 healthy adults during single-target flicker stimulation were utilized for model training and testing. The deep learning models outperformed traditional methods significantly, with the use of Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD metrics yielding greater robustness to latency shifts than Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances. Implementing temporal data augmentation by applying minor temporal shifts further enhanced the generalization capabilities of these models across different sessions. Among all tested architectures, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the highest average decoding accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating its effectiveness. These findings highlight the promise of data-driven deep learning approaches for reliable, single-trial decoding of C-VEPs, paving the way for more adaptive and robust non-invasive BCI systems. <div>

<div> Keywords: local explanation, adversarial attack, stability, fidelity, decision boundary<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Machine learning models deployed in critical applications often lack transparency and operate as "black boxes," making interpretability essential.<br />2. Local explanation methods like LIME seek to provide interpretability by approximating complex model behavior locally with interpretable models but face issues such as instability and poor local fidelity.<br />3. The paper introduces a novel method called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to overcome these limitations by focusing on the model's local decision boundary around a test instance.<br />4. ABLE generates neighborhood points by adding bounded Gaussian noise to the test instance and uses a two-step adversarial attack process to create adversarial pairs (A and A') that bracket the local decision boundary—A differs in label from D while A' shares D's label.<br />5. A linear model trained on these adversarial pairs effectively approximates the local decision boundary, thereby improving explanation stability and fidelity.<br />6. Experimental validation on six UCI benchmark datasets across three different deep neural network architectures shows that ABLE outperforms state-of-the-art local explanation methods in both stability and fidelity. <div>
arXiv:2511.21952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art.

<div> Click-through rate prediction, Transformer, user behavior modeling, deep learning, Taobao dataset  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study focuses on improving click-through rate (CTR) prediction essential for advertising systems by leveraging a large-scale Taobao dataset from Alibaba. Initially, traditional supervised models like logistic regression and Light-GBM were used, trained on static features including user demographics, ad characteristics, and contextual metadata, serving as interpretable and fast benchmarks but limited in capturing complex user behaviors. To better capture user intent, the researchers incorporated extensive behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions spanning 22 days. By encoding user action sequences, they created dynamic representations of user interests over time. Deep learning models, particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), fused behavioral embeddings with static features and significantly improved performance. To further model temporal dynamics, a Transformer-based architecture employing self-attention mechanisms was proposed, effectively understanding contextual dependencies in user behaviors, including timing and frequency of interactions. This Transformer model improved the AUC metric by 2.81% compared to the logistic regression baseline, especially enhancing predictions for users with diverse or evolving interests. Beyond modeling, the study also suggested an A/B testing framework for practical evaluation. Finally, it discussed broader implications, advocating that personalized ad targeting techniques could be applied to public health for precise delivery of health information and behavioral guidance, thus extending the impact of CTR prediction research beyond e-commerce. <div>

Abstract: Click-through rates prediction is critical in modern advertising systems, where ranking relevance and user engagement directly impact platform efficiency and business value. In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance. Our research provides a roadmap for advancing click-through rate predictions and extending their value beyond e-commerce.

<div> Keywords: multi-template machine learning, inverse design, transformers, frequency-domain self-transfer learning, evolutionary strategy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper systematically investigates the development of multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models tailored for the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) used in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Initially, it benchmarks four prevalent ML architectures—MLP, CNN, UNet, and GT—using consistent datasets across various transformer topologies to establish baseline performance. To surpass these baselines, the authors introduce a novel frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that leverages correlations between adjacent frequency bands, resulting in significant prediction accuracy improvements of around 30% to 50% in S-parameters. Utilizing these enhanced ML models, the study proceeds to develop an inverse design framework centered on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is rigorously validated through multiple impedance-matching tasks, consistently demonstrating rapid convergence and reliable performance. Collectively, these advancements contribute toward the overarching goal of AI-powered automation for transforming specifications to physical layouts (specs-to-GDS) in RFIC design. The findings empower RFIC designers by integrating sophisticated AI tools into the design workflow, thereby accelerating design cycles and improving model reliability for practical applications in RFIC transformer design. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.

<div> Keywords: agentic AI, safety and security, risk taxonomy, AI-driven red teaming, enterprise deployment<br /><br />Summary: This paper presents a dynamic, actionable framework designed to enhance the safety and security of agentic AI systems deployed in enterprise environments. It argues that safety and security emerge not just from individual models but from the complex interactions between models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating context. The authors introduce a novel approach to identifying new agentic risks through a user safety perspective, highlighting how safety and security concerns, traditionally distinct in isolated models, become interconnected in agentic systems. A unified operational agentic risk taxonomy is proposed, addressing classic safety and security issues alongside unique risks such as tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification. Central to the framework is a contextual agentic risk management approach leveraging auxiliary AI models and agents under human supervision to facilitate risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. The study emphasizes AI-driven, sandboxed red teaming as a key technique for uncovering hidden risks. Effectiveness is demonstrated through a detailed case study of NVIDIA’s AI-Q Research Assistant, illustrating comprehensive end-to-end safety and security assessments in complex agentic workflows. Finally, the authors release a dataset with over 10,000 simulated attack and defense scenarios, aiming to support further research in agentic AI safety. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic and actionable framework for securing agentic AI systems in enterprise deployment. We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.

<div> Keywords: hypergraphs, shortest-path queries, online algorithm, orderly hypertrees, evolutionary tree reconstruction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper addresses the problem of learning hypergraphs using shortest-path queries (SP-queries), focusing on a novel and well-defined class of hypertrees named orderly hypertrees.  
2. It introduces the first provably optimal online algorithm tailored for this class, which can also be converted to an optimal offline learning algorithm.  
3. Orderly hypertrees are analyzed within the Fagin hierarchy, a framework in database theory that categorizes acyclic hypergraphs, and this class strictly includes the largest previously known class of acyclic hypergraphs that can be learned with subquadratic SP-query complexity.  
4. Recognizing practical limitations in distance measurements, especially in applications like evolutionary tree reconstruction where distance accuracy decreases with increasing distance, the authors consider a bounded distance query model.  
5. Within this bounded distance query framework, the paper establishes asymptotically tight complexity bounds for the problem of learning general hypertrees, thus expanding theoretical understanding and practical applicability in scenarios where query accuracy is limited. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning hypergraphs with shortest-path queries (SP-queries), and present the first provably optimal online algorithm for a broad and natural class of hypertrees that we call orderly hypertrees. Our online algorithm can be transformed into a provably optimal offline algorithm. Orderly hypertrees can be positioned within the Fagin hierarchy of acyclic hypergraph (well-studied in database theory), and strictly encompass the broadest class in this hierarchy that is learnable with subquadratic SP-query complexity.
  Recognizing that in some contexts, such as evolutionary tree reconstruction, distance measurements can degrade with increased distance, we also consider a learning model that uses bounded distance queries. In this model, we demonstrate asymptotically tight complexity bounds for learning general hypertrees.

<div> Equilibrium Propagation, Helmholtz free energy, Contrastive Hebbian Learning, Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, finite nudging<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a significant advancement in Equilibrium Propagation (EP) by removing the traditional requirement for infinitesimal perturbations in the learning process. Instead, the authors introduce a finite-nudge framework that grounds local credit assignment more robustly. They achieve this by modeling network states probabilistically as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions instead of deterministic points, enabling a more general and exact treatment. A key theoretical result demonstrated is that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between the nudged phase and the free phase corresponds exactly to the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This insight provides a rigorous justification for the Contrastive Hebbian Learning update rule as an exact gradient estimator, even with large nudges, without relying on infinitesimal approximations or assumptions of convexity. Moreover, the study extends EP by deriving a generalized algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, which supports learning with strong error signals—something that previous infinitesimal approximation methods could not handle effectively. Overall, this work broadens the applicability and theoretical foundation of EP for training neural networks, potentially improving learning efficiency and flexibility in practical scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

arXiv:2511.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drowsy driving is a growing cause of traffic accidents, prompting recent exploration of electroencephalography (EEG)-based drowsiness detection systems. However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\%, an improvement of 11.73\% over the best TTA baseline. This demonstrates that our proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

Abstract: The electric power sector is a leading source of air pollutant emissions, impacting the public health of nearly every community. Although regulatory measures have reduced air pollutants, fossil fuels remain a significant component of the energy supply, highlighting the need for more advanced demand-side approaches to reduce the public health impacts. To enable health-informed demand-side management, we introduce HealthPredictor, a domain-specific AI model that provides an end-to-end pipeline linking electricity use to public health outcomes. The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management. Overall, this work shows how AI models can be explicitly designed to enable health-informed energy management for advancing public health and broader societal well-being.

<title>Convergence Dynamics of Over-Parameterized Score Matching for a Single Gaussian</title>

<div> Keywords: score matching, gradient descent, over-parameterized models, Gaussian distribution, convergence guarantees  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the optimization dynamics of score matching when training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. First, it considers a student model with \( n \) parameters trained using population score matching on Gaussian data. Second, it establishes that in the large noise regime, gradient descent achieves global convergence to the ground truth parameters. Third, in the low noise regime, a stationary point exists, making global convergence difficult to prove generally. However, under the condition of exponentially small parameter initialization, gradient descent is shown to converge to the ground truth. Fourth, the study demonstrates that without such small initialization, parameters may fail to converge. Fifth, when parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth, only one parameter tends to converge while others diverge, yet the loss function still converges to zero at a rate of \( 1/\tau \), with \(\tau\) iterations. The paper also provides a nearly matching lower bound for this convergence rate. Importantly, this is the first work proving global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework, advancing the theoretical understanding of score matching in generative modeling. <div>
arXiv:2511.22069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score matching has become a central training objective in modern generative modeling, particularly in diffusion models, where it is used to learn high-dimensional data distributions through the estimation of score functions. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/\tau$ rate, where $\tau$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime. This is the first work to establish global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework.

<div> Keywords: EV charging demand, hypergraphs, spatiotemporal forecasting, multi-view modeling, cross-attention  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Accurate forecasting of electric vehicle (EV) charging demand is critical for maintaining grid stability and enabling EVs to actively participate in the electricity market. Current forecasting methods, particularly those using graph neural networks, typically focus only on pairwise relationships between charging stations, which limits their ability to capture the complex, group-wise interactions present in urban charging networks. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose HyperCast, a novel forecasting framework based on hypergraphs that can model higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies in EV charging patterns. HyperCast incorporates multi-view hypergraphs that represent both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities among stations. It also integrates multi-timescale input data, allowing it to distinguish recent trends from weekly periodic patterns. The framework is equipped with specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and custom cross-attention mechanisms to effectively combine information from multiple views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, confirming the benefit of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for improved forecasting accuracy. This approach advances the capabilities of EV demand prediction by harnessing complex group interactions and multi-dimensional dependencies. <div>

Abstract: Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.

<div> Keywords: temporal graphs, anomaly detection, edge streams, graph neural networks, half-space trees  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of real-time anomaly detection in temporal graphs, which model streaming information through dynamic edge changes. Identifying unusual temporal connections (edge anomalies) is critical for preventing risks in various real-world applications, but is complicated by factors such as concept drift, high data volumes, and the need for immediate responses. The authors propose ARES, an unsupervised framework that detects anomalies in edge streams by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Half-Space Trees (HST). GNNs are used to extract features by embedding node and edge properties into a latent space, effectively capturing different anomalous patterns like spikes and bursts. HST then partitions this latent space to efficiently isolate anomalies. ARES operates without requiring labeled data, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, a supervised thresholding method based on statistical dispersion of anomaly scores is incorporated to optimize threshold setting using minimal labeled examples, enhancing adaptability across domains. The framework’s performance is demonstrated via extensive experiments on multiple real-world cyber-attack scenarios, showing competitive detection accuracy, as well as favorable space and time complexity when compared to existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2511.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world scenarios involving streaming information can be represented as temporal graphs, where data flows through dynamic changes in edges over time. Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains. We validate ARES through extensive evaluations across several real-world cyber-attack scenarios, comparing its performance against existing methods while analyzing its space and time complexity.

<div> Keywords: federated learning, momentum, sharpness-aware minimization, non-IID, convergence

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses critical challenges in federated learning (FL), focusing on achieving fast convergence under tight communication constraints while ensuring model generalization across non-IID client data distributions. It identifies two key failure modes when combining momentum and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) in FL: local-global curvature misalignment, where local SAM perturbations do not align with the global loss geometry, and momentum-echo oscillation, a late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose FedWMSAM, a novel method that introduces a momentum-guided global perturbation based on server-aggregated momentum to align clients’ SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling an efficient single-backprop SAM approximation. Additionally, they design a cosine-similarity adaptive rule to couple momentum and SAM, implementing an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule that stabilizes training. Theoretical contributions include a non-IID convergence bound explicitly accounting for perturbation-induced variance and its dependence on system variables such as the number of clients, rounds, and local steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate the method’s effectiveness, adaptability, robustness, and superiority over existing approaches in overcoming FL optimization challenges. The implementation code is publicly available. <div>
arXiv:2511.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), models must \emph{converge quickly} under tight communication budgets while \emph{generalizing} across non-IID client distributions. These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $\sigma_\rho^2=\sigma^2+(L\rho)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

<div> Keywords: Quantum Bayesian Optimization, smart manufacturing, aerospace fuselage assembly, sample efficiency, shape control<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of improving sample efficiency in aerospace fuselage assembly through precise shape adjustment to minimize dimensional gaps between assembled sections. Traditional Monte Carlo methods require many samples to estimate mean responses accurately, causing inefficiency in manufacturing contexts. The authors propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework that leverages quantum algorithms capable of achieving similar estimation accuracy with fewer samples. QBO integrates a quantum oracle, which relies on finite element analysis (FEA) or surrogate models, to obtain more accurate environmental response estimations with fewer queries. The optimization uses an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function to strategically select input parameters that maximize the objective. The method is theoretically proven to reduce sample usage while maintaining optimization performance comparable to classical approaches. A case study involving force-controlled actuators applied to one fuselage section demonstrates QBO’s practical advantages in reducing dimensional error and uncertainty. Experimental results confirm that with the same number of queries, QBO outperforms classical methods in accuracy and reliability, indicating significant potential for improving manufacturing process efficiency in aerospace assembly through quantum-enhanced techniques. <div>
arXiv:2511.22090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts in smart manufacturing have enhanced aerospace fuselage assembly processes, particularly by innovating shape adjustment techniques to minimize dimensional gaps between assembled sections. Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, low-rank factorization, trustworthiness, adversarial robustness, fairness  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the trustworthiness implications of compressing large language models (LLMs) using low-rank factorization, a technique effective for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. First, the study finds that low-rank compression tends to preserve or improve training data privacy but weakens protection of personally identifiable information (PII) during interactive conversations. Second, adversarial robustness of compressed LLMs is generally maintained and often enhanced, even when models undergo deep compression. Third, ethical reasoning abilities of LLMs degrade in zero-shot evaluation scenarios after compression, but this decline can be partially mitigated by employing few-shot prompting techniques. Fourth, the analysis reveals that fairness metrics deteriorate under low-rank compression. Additionally, the paper explores how factors such as model scale and fine-tuning impact trustworthiness, which are critical considerations in low-rank compression strategies. Finally, to guide the development of more trustworthy compressed models, a gradient-based attribution analysis is conducted to identify specific layers within LLMs that contribute most significantly to adversarial robustness, offering actionable insights for future compression methods balancing efficiency and trustworthiness. <div>
arXiv:2511.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances across domains, yet their massive size hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.

<div> Dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO), millimeter-wave networks, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), energy efficiency (EE), quality-of-service (QoS)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks to enhance energy efficiency (EE) while adhering to strict quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Unlike traditional approaches that use static and aggregated base station (BS) traffic models, this work captures the inherent non-stationary traffic dynamics by introducing a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), named MARL-DDQN. The framework operates in a realistic 3D urban environment incorporating time-varying, community-based user equipment (UE) mobility. MARL-DDQN supports scalable and distributed decision-making across multiple agents, reducing signaling overhead compared to single-agent RL methods. The study integrates an accurate BS power consumption model and beamforming techniques to effectively quantify EE. QoS is measured via throughput, ensuring fairness and mitigating inter-cell interference. Simulation results demonstrate that MARL-DDQN significantly outperforms existing methods such as All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO. The proposed approach achieves up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule in EE, delivers an 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and satisfies QoS constraints 95% of the time in dynamic scenarios, proving its effectiveness and practicality for real-world mmWave network deployments. <div>
arXiv:2511.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks is essential for maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. However, existing optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches rely on aggregated, static base station (BS) traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary traffic dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), referred to as MARL-DDQN, for adaptive SMO in a 3D urban environment with a time-varying and community-based user equipment (UE) mobility model. Unlike conventional single-agent RL, MARL-DDQN enables scalable, distributed decision-making with minimal signaling overhead. A realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming are integrated to accurately quantify EE, while QoS is defined in terms of throughput. The method adapts SMO policies to maximize EE while mitigating inter-cell interference and ensuring throughput fairness. Simulations show that MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies, including All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO, achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios.

<div> Continuous learning, Deep Spiking Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, implantable brain-machine interfaces, energy efficiency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The number of neurons recorded simultaneously in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) is exponentially increasing, necessitating efficient data compression strategies. Integrating the neural decoder within the implant offers a solution, but decoder performance often suffers due to system non-stationarity. Continuous learning is therefore critical for maintaining reliable operation without frequent retraining, which also ensures user safety and comfort. Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are promising candidates for resource-efficient neural decoding compatible with the energy constraints of iBMIs. This work proposes continuous learning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, specifically Banditron and AGREL, adapted for DSNNs. These algorithms are computationally lightweight and effectively address non-stationarity. Experiments were conducted in both open-loop and closed-loop formats. In open-loop tests, DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL maintained stable accuracy over extended durations. In closed-loop experiments with perturbations, DSNN Banditron’s performance in time-to-target matched that of DSNN AGREL but achieved significant reductions of 98% in memory access and 99% in multiply-and-accumulate operations during training. Compared to prior continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron’s drastically lower computational demand makes it an excellent candidate for future wireless iBMI systems. <div>

Abstract: The number of simultaneously recorded neurons follows an exponentially increasing trend in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). Integrating the neural decoder in the implant is an effective data compression method for future wireless iBMIs. However, the non-stationarity of the system makes the performance of the decoder unreliable. To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training. Compared to previous continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron requires 98% less computes making it a prime candidate for future wireless iBMI systems.

<div> Keywords: solar wind, surrogate modeling, Spherical Fourier Neural Operator, space weather forecasting, magnetohydrodynamic models<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun’s corona, significantly influences the heliosphere and space systems near Earth, where its variations can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications.<br />2. Accurate modeling of solar wind variations like high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is crucial for effective space weather forecasting.<br />3.

The SFNO surrogate is compared to the existing HUX numerical surrogate, showing comparable or improved performance on multiple evaluation metrics.<br />6. Although HUX exhibits greater physical smoothness, this highlights the need for better evaluation metrics rather than a limitation of SFNO.<br />7. SFNO is flexible, trainable, and supports efficient real-time forecasting, with the ability to improve as more data become available.<br />8.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Variations such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications, making accurate modeling essential for space weather forecasting. While 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are used to simulate and investigate these variations in the solar wind, they tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness in investigating the impacts of boundary condition uncertainty. In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO. As a flexible and trainable approach, SFNO enables efficient real-time forecasting and can improve with more data.

<div> Keywords: missing data imputation, heterogeneous data, variational graph autoencoder, dual-decoder architecture, Transformer embedding<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of imputing missing values in real-world tabular datasets, particularly when data involve heterogeneous numerical and categorical features. 2. Existing imputation methods often struggle to capture complex dependencies between samples and features, limiting their effectiveness on heterogeneous data. 3. The authors propose IVGAE, a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework that models data as a bipartite graph connecting samples and features, enabling graph representation learning to better capture structural relationships. 4. A novel dual-decoder architecture is introduced, consisting of one decoder that reconstructs feature embeddings and another that models missingness patterns, thus incorporating structural priors that are aware of the missing data mechanisms. 5. To efficiently handle categorical variables, a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module replaces traditional one-hot encoding, reducing dimensionality and enhancing encoding quality. 6. The framework is extensively tested on 16 real-world datasets across different missing data scenarios—MCAR (Missing Completely At Random), MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random)—with missing rates up to 30%. 7. IVGAE consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of RMSE for imputation quality and F1 score for downstream tasks, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness. 8. The authors provide open-source code and datasets at the given GitHub repository to facilitate reproducibility and further research. <div>

Abstract: Handling missing data remains a fundamental challenge in real-world tabular datasets, especially when data are heterogeneous with both numerical and categorical features. Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex structural dependencies and handle heterogeneous data effectively. We present \textbf{IVGAE}, a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework for robust imputation of incomplete heterogeneous data. IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships and applies graph representation learning to model structural dependencies. A key innovation is its \textit{dual-decoder architecture}, where one decoder reconstructs feature embeddings and the other models missingness patterns, providing structural priors aware of missing mechanisms. To better encode categorical variables, we introduce a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module that avoids high-dimensional one-hot encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show that IVGAE achieves consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30\% missing rates.

<div> Dimensionality reduction, PCA, nonlinear embeddings, variational framework, manifold learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper addresses the limitations of traditional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), notably their inability to capture nonlinear structures within data manifolds. 2. It introduces a novel variational framework that conceptualizes dimensionality reduction as an optimal manifold embedding problem, thereby enabling more flexible, nonlinear embeddings than PCA. 3. The framework's variational nature provides interpretability benefits—in particular, each solution derived from this approach satisfies a specific set of partial differential equations, linking the embedding process to the underlying mathematical structure. 4. The authors analyze how the solutions reflect symmetries inherent to the embedding objective, further deepening the understanding of the learned representations. 5. In addition to theoretical insights, the framework can be analytically characterized in various scenarios, and interestingly, it recovers PCA exactly as a special case, demonstrating its generality and connection to classical methods. <div>
arXiv:2511.22128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction algorithms like principal component analysis (PCA) are workhorses of machine learning and neuroscience, but each has well-known limitations. Variants of PCA are simple and interpretable, but not flexible enough to capture nonlinear data manifold structure. More flexible approaches have other problems: autoencoders are generally difficult to interpret, and graph-embedding-based methods can produce pathological distortions in manifold geometry. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction algorithms as solutions to an optimal manifold embedding problem. By construction, this framework permits nonlinear embeddings, allowing its solutions to be more flexible than PCA. Moreover, the variational nature of the framework has useful consequences for interpretability: each solution satisfies a set of partial differential equations, and can be shown to reflect symmetries of the embedding objective. We discuss these features in detail and show that solutions can be analytically characterized in some cases. Interestingly, one special case exactly recovers PCA.

<div> Experiential Learning, Product Recommendation, User Personas, Large Language Models, Adaptive Agents<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of enabling agents to operate effectively in dynamic real-world environments where knowledge is incomplete and preferences shift over time. It highlights a critical gap in current evaluations, which tend to focus on tasks without ambiguity and fail to assess an agent’s capacity for adaptive, experiential learning. The authors introduce a new benchmark named BELA (Benchmark for Experiential Learning and Active exploration) tailored to test and promote in-context experiential learning within a product recommendation setting. BELA integrates three core components: a diverse set of real-world products from Amazon, multiple user personas encapsulating different and latent consumer preferences, and a large language model–based user simulator driven by these personas to generate interactive dialogue trajectories. Through this setup, agents must learn and refine their recommendations over multiple episodes by actively gathering information and adapting to evolving preferences expressed in natural language conversations. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models currently underperform on this benchmark, showing limited improvement across interactions, which underscores the need for developing more agentic systems that are capable of effective in-context learning and adaptive reasoning through experience. <div>
arXiv:2511.22130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reliably navigate ever-shifting real-world environments, agents must grapple with incomplete knowledge and adapt their behavior through experience. However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.

<div> Keywords: probabilistic digital twin, Gaussian Process Latent Force Models, Bayesian Neural Networks, uncertainty quantification, model-form errors

<br /><br />Summary: This article introduces a probabilistic digital twin framework designed for response prediction in dynamical systems where the governing physics models are misspecified. The method combines Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to provide an end-to-end approach that incorporates uncertainty throughout inference and prediction stages. During the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are modeled as latent input forces added to a nominal linear dynamical system and are jointly estimated alongside system states using GPLFM based on sensor data. Subsequently, a BNN is trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, capturing diagnostic uncertainty effectively. In the prognosis phase, this learned mapping generates pseudo-measurements that feed into Kalman filtering for improved state prediction. This framework ensures systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of digital twins. The effectiveness and robustness of the framework are validated through four nonlinear system examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, the Bouc-Wen hysteretic benchmark, and the Silverbox experimental dataset, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification. <div>

<div> Keywords: small language models, agentic tasks, edge devices, hybrid optimization, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the effectiveness of small language models (SLMs) on agentic tasks such as function, tool, and API calling, with a focus on enabling autonomous agents to run on edge devices without cloud dependency. The authors evaluate these models using the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) framework, covering categories like simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection, assessing both live and non-live scenarios including multi-turn evaluations. They explore various parameter-driven optimization strategies including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reinforcement learning (RL), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment, and hybrid combinations of these methods. The study reports results for models such as TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM. Additionally, a DPO training pipeline was constructed from AgentBank datasets (e.g., ALFRED), converting SFT data into chosen-rejected pairs via TinyLlama-generated rejected outputs and manual validation. Results show a significant performance gap between medium-sized models (1-3 billion parameters) and ultra-compact models (<1 billion parameters), with medium-sized models reaching up to 65.74% overall accuracy and 55.62% multi-turn accuracy using hybrid optimization. The findings emphasize that hybrid optimization strategies enable SLMs to deliver accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI capable of running privately and with low latency on edge devices, advancing practical cloud-independent autonomous agents. <div>

We report results for models including TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM across BFCL categories (simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection), both in live and non-live settings, and in multi-turn evaluations. We additionally detail a DPO training pipeline constructed from AgentBank data (e.g., ALFRED), including our conversion of SFT data to chosen-rejected pairs using TinyLlama responses as rejected outputs and manual validation. Our results demonstrate clear accuracy differences across model scales where medium-sized models (1-3B parameters) significantly outperform ultra-compact models (<1B parameters), achieving up to 65.74% overall accuracy, and 55.62% multi-turn accuracy with hybrid optimization. This study highlights the importance of hybrid optimization strategies that enable small language models to deliver accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI on edge devices, making privacy-preserving, low-latency autonomous agents practical beyond the cloud.

Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image samplers, sampling schedule, Dirichlet policy, James-Stein estimator, Stable Diffusion

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper proposes a novel post-training approach for text-to-image samplers that focuses on rescheduling the sampling timeline rather than modifying model weights. Unlike traditional fixed, global schedules, the authors introduce instance-level schedules conditioned on prompts and noise, learned through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To achieve accurate gradient estimates in the high-dimensional policy learning setting, they develop a new reward baseline based on a James-Stein estimator, which provably reduces estimation error compared to existing methods, enhancing performance. The rescheduled samplers demonstrate improved text-image alignment, better text rendering, and enhanced compositional control across popular models like Stable Diffusion and Flux. Importantly, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler using this scheduling framework matches the generation quality of specialized, distilled samplers such as Flux-Schnell, showing efficiency gains without retraining or distillation. The work presents their adaptive scheduling as a model-agnostic, post-training tool that unlocks further generative capabilities in pretrained samplers, offering a practical and scalable alternative to weight fine-tuning or distillation for improving synthesis quality. <div>
arXiv:2511.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most post-training methods for text-to-image samplers focus on model weights: either fine-tuning the backbone for alignment or distilling it for few-step efficiency. We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.

<div> ICU data, self-supervised learning, foundation model, Longformer, clinical prediction  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling intensive care unit (ICU) data, which is inherently irregular, heterogeneous, and temporally fragmented, making clinical prediction difficult to generalize. The authors introduce PULSE-ICU, a self-supervised foundation model designed to learn event-level representations directly from large-scale electronic health record (EHR) sequences without needing data resampling or manual feature engineering. A unified embedding module captures multiple aspects of ICU data, including event identity, continuous values, measurement units, and temporal information. PULSE-ICU employs a Longformer-based encoder, which efficiently processes long time-series trajectories within ICU records. The model was fine-tuned across 18 diverse clinical prediction tasks such as mortality prediction, intervention forecasting, and phenotype identification, demonstrating robust and strong performance across all tasks. Additionally, external validation on datasets like eICU, HiRID, and P12 revealed that PULSE-ICU maintains high accuracy with minimal fine-tuning, indicating strong robustness to domain shifts and varying dataset constraints. These results highlight that foundation-style modeling can enhance data efficiency and adaptability in clinical settings and offers a scalable framework for ICU decision support tools adaptable to multiple clinical environments. <div>

We present PULSE-ICU, a self-supervised foundation model that learns event-level ICU representations from large-scale EHR sequences without resampling or manual feature engineering. A unified embedding module encodes event identity, continuous values, units, and temporal attributes, while a Longformer-based encoder enables efficient modeling of long trajectories. PULSE-ICU was fine-tuned across 18 prediction tasks, including mortality, intervention forecasting, and phenotype identification, achieving strong performance across task types. External validation on eICU, HiRID, and P12 showed substantial improvements with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness to domain shift and variable constraints. These findings suggest that foundation-style modeling can improve data efficiency and adaptability, providing a scalable framework for ICU decision support across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function that explains expert behavior using only fixed demonstration data, without any additional online interaction. We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.

<title>FedRE: A Representation Entanglement Framework for Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across clients without compromising privacy. While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. The codes are available at https://github.com/AIResearch-Group/FedRE.

<title>TreeCoder: Systematic Exploration and Optimisation of Decoding and Constraints for LLM Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generate code, yet their outputs often violate syntactic or semantic constraints when guided only through natural language prompts. We introduce TreeCoder, the most general and flexible framework to date for exploring decoding strategies, constraints, and hyperparameters in LLMs, and use it in code generation to enforce correctness and structure during decoding rather than relying on prompt engineering. TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search over candidate programs, where both decoding strategies and constraint functions - such as style, syntax, execution - are treated as first-class, optimisable components. This design enables systematic exploration and automatic tuning of decoding configurations using standard optimisation techniques. Experiments on the MBPP (Python) and SQL-Spider benchmarks show that TreeCoder consistently improves accuracy across open-source models such as CodeLlama, Mistral and DeepSeek, often outperforming their unconstrained baselines by considerable margins.

<title>The Hidden Cost of Approximation in Online Mirror Descent</title>

Abstract: Online mirror descent (OMD) is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that underlies many algorithms in optimization, machine learning and sequential decision-making. The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret.

<title>Online Dynamic Pricing of Complementary Products</title>

Abstract: Traditional pricing paradigms, once dominated by static models and rule-based heuristics, are increasingly being replaced by dynamic, data-driven approaches powered by machine learning algorithms. Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands. The algorithm utilizes transaction data to identify advantageous complementary relationships through an integer programming problem between different items, and then optimizes pricing strategies using data-driven and computationally efficient multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. We validate our solution in a simulated environment, and we demonstrate that our solution improves the revenue w.r.t. a comparable learning algorithm ignoring such interactions.

Abstract: Forecasting tumor growth is critical for optimizing treatment. Classical growth models such as the Gompertz and Bertalanffy equations capture general tumor dynamics but may fail to adapt to patient-specific variability, particularly with limited data available. In this study, we leverage Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), to construct adaptive tumor growth models capable of learning from experimental data. Using the Gompertz model as a baseline, we replace rigid terms with adaptive neural networks to capture hidden dynamics through robust modeling in the Julia programming language. We use our models to perform forecasting under data constraints and symbolic recovery to transform the learned dynamics into explicit mathematical expressions. Our approach has the potential to improve predictive accuracy, guiding dynamic and effective treatment strategies for improved clinical outcomes.

<title>FLUX: Efficient Descriptor-Driven Clustered Federated Learning under Arbitrary Distribution Shifts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22305</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.22305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, when this assumption does not hold, the global model accuracy may drop significantly, limiting FL applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

<title>DeXposure: A Dataset and Benchmarks for Inter-protocol Credit Exposure in Decentralized Financial Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We curate the DeXposure dataset, the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, covering global markets of 43.7 million entries across 4.3 thousand protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3 thousand tokens, from 2020 to 2025. A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.

<title>SingleQuant: Efficient Quantization of Large Language Models in a Single Pass</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) quantization facilitates deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings, but existing methods that combine incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation lead to serious convergence pathology. This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization. For example, when quantizing LLaMA-2-13B, SingleQuant achieves 1,400$\times$ quantization speedup and increases +0.57\% average task performance compared to the selected best baseline.

Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

<title>Cleaning the Pool: Progressive Filtering of Unlabeled Pools in Deep Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Existing active learning (AL) strategies capture fundamentally different notions of data value, e.g., uncertainty or representativeness. Consequently, the effectiveness of strategies can vary substantially across datasets, models, and even AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance, as no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process. We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case. Finally, the ensemble of REFINE can be easily extended with upcoming state-of-the-art AL strategies.

Abstract: On-device machine learning (ML) has become a fundamental component of emerging mobile applications. Adaptive model deployment delivers efficient inference for heterogeneous device capabilities and performance requirements through customizing neural architectures. SuperNet-based approaches offer a promising solution by generating a large number of model variants from a pre-trained ML model. However, applying SuperNet in existing frameworks suffers from tedious model-aware development and time-consuming hardware-aware profiling, which limits their practical adoption.
  We present AutoTailor, the first framework to enable automated, end-to-end SuperNet-based adaptive model deployment for edge devices. Unlike manual SuperNet construction, AutoTailor employs a computation graph-guided compilation approach to automatically transform user-provided ML models into SuperNets. To support efficient specialization, AutoTailor incorporates learning-free latency and accuracy predictors, enabling low-cost yet accurate performance prediction. Our extended evaluations demonstrate that AutoTailor reduces the lines of code for SuperNet construction by 11--27$\times$, decreases hardware-aware profiling costs by at least 11$\times$, and achieves up to 15.60\% absolute accuracy improvement and 60.03\% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches across diverse models and devices.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained considerable attention in the field of physiological signal analysis. They leverage long-range dependencies and complex patterns in temporal signals, allowing them to achieve performance superior to traditional RNN and CNN models. However, they require high computational intensity and memory demands. In this work, we present Efficient-Husformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture developed with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for multi-class stress detection across two multimodal physiological datasets (WESAD and CogLoad). The main contributions of this work are: (1) the design of a structured search space, targeting effective hyperparameter optimization; (2) a comprehensive ablation study evaluating the impact of architectural decisions; (3) consistent performance improvements over the original Husformer, with the best configuration achieving an accuracy of 88.41 and 92.61 (improvements of 13.83% and 6.98%) on WESAD and CogLoad datasets, respectively. The best-performing configuration is achieved with the (L + dm) or (L + FFN) modality combinations, using a single layer, 3 attention heads, a model dimension of 18/30, and FFN dimension of 120/30, resulting in a compact model with only about 30k parameters.

<title>SuRe: Surprise-Driven Prioritised Replay for Continual LLM Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning, one's ability to adapt to a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a major challenge in machine learning and a key gap between artificial and human intelligence. While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Geospatial observational datasets are often limited to point measurements, making temporal prediction and spatial interpolation essential for constructing continuous fields. This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors. Code is available at https://github.com/pazolka/interpolation-prediction-gwsa.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.

Abstract: Recent work has extended the invariance principle for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization from Euclidean to graph data, where challenges arise due to complex structures and diverse distribution shifts in node attributes and topology. To handle these, Chen et al. proposed CIGA (Chen et al., 2022b), which uses causal modeling and an information-theoretic objective to extract a single invariant subgraph capturing causal features. However, this single-subgraph focus can miss multiple causal patterns. Liu et al. (2025) addressed this with SuGAr, which learns and aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via a sampler and diversity regularizer, improving robustness but still relying on simple uniform or greedy aggregation. To overcome this, the proposed PISA framework introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation that prioritizes and combines subgraph representations more effectively. Experiments on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD (Ji et al., 2023), show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods.

Abstract: In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.

Abstract: We present adversarial flow models, a class of generative models that unifies adversarial models and flow models. Our method supports native one-step or multi-step generation and is trained using the adversarial objective. Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38. We additionally show the possibility of end-to-end training of 56-layer and 112-layer models through depth repetition without any intermediate supervision, and achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 using a single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We present a novel logic-based concept called Space Explanations for classifying neural networks that gives provable guarantees of the behavior of the network in continuous areas of the input feature space. To automatically generate space explanations, we leverage a range of flexible Craig interpolation algorithms and unsatisfiable core generation. Based on real-life case studies, ranging from small to medium to large size, we demonstrate that the generated explanations are more meaningful than those computed by state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) output ranked lists of items, such as movies or restaurants, that users may find interesting, based on the user's past ratings and ratings from other users. RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely. These results highlight that no single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; instead, each provides trade-offs under different privacy regimes and data conditions.

Abstract: We introduce an expander-sketching framework for list-decodable linear regression that achieves sample complexity $\tilde{O}((d+\log(1/\delta))/\alpha)$, list size $O(1/\alpha)$, and near input-sparsity running time $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(X)+d^{3}/\alpha)$ under standard sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our method uses lossless expanders to synthesize lightly contaminated batches, enabling robust aggregation and a short spectral filtering stage that matches the best known efficient guarantees while avoiding SoS machinery and explicit batch structure.

<title>Where to Measure: Epistemic Uncertainty-Based Sensor Placement with ConvCNPs</title>

arXiv:2511.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sensor placement is critical for modeling spatio-temporal systems such as environmental and climate processes. Neural Processes (NPs), particularly Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), provide scalable probabilistic models with uncertainty estimates, making them well-suited for data-driven sensor placement. However, existing approaches rely on total predictive uncertainty, which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, that may lead to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions. To address this, we propose expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement. To enable this, we extend ConvCNPs with a Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty.

<title>Entropy is all you need for Inter-Seed Cross-Play in Hanabi</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22581</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.22581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that in Hanabi, one of the most complex and popular benchmarks for zero-shot coordination and ad-hoc teamplay, a standard implementation of independent PPO with a slightly higher entropy coefficient 0.05 instead of the typically used 0.01, achieves a new state-of-the-art in cross-play between different seeds, beating by a significant margin all previous specialized algorithms, which were specifically designed for this setting. We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $\lambda_{\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination.

<title>The Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) on the Simplex</title>

arXiv:2511.22587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the supervised binary classification setting, score-oriented losses have been introduced with the aim of optimizing a chosen performance metric directly during the training phase, thus avoiding \textit{a posteriori} threshold tuning. To do this, in their construction, the decision threshold is treated as a random variable provided with a certain \textit{a priori} distribution. In this paper, we use a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend such score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining the Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions. As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT o1, ChatGPT o3, and DeepSeek R1 have shown great potential in solving difficult problems. However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment. Our code is open-sourced in https://github.com/puleya1277/CaveEnv.

Abstract: The integration of IoT and AI has unlocked innovation across industries, but growing privacy concerns and data isolation hinder progress. Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation flow and diffusion generative models to optimize task-specific objectives while preserving prior information is crucial for real-world applications such as molecular design, protein docking, and creative image generation. Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes.

Abstract: A new approach to data-driven discovery of Koopman eigenfunctions without a pre-defined set of basis functions is proposed. The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems.

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods excel in well-defined search spaces but struggle with design problems where transformations and design parameters are difficult to define. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging encoded domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce AUTO, an LLM agent framework that treats design optimization as a gradient-free search problem guided by strategic LLM reasoning. The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication. The framework achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization methodologies. It completes optimizations in approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of up to \$159 per run, compared to an estimated cost of up to \$480 with median-wage software developers. These findings open the door to automating design optimization in ill-defined search spaces with limited prior information.

<title>Structure-aware Hybrid-order Similarity Learning for Multi-view Unsupervised Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently emerged as an effective dimensionality reduction method for unlabeled multi-view data. However, most existing methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs to preserve local structure, often overlooking the global structure that can be captured by second-order similarity. In addition, a few MUFS methods leverage predefined second-order similarity graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers and resulting in suboptimal feature selection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection. Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Building reliable deception detectors for AI systems -- methods that could predict when an AI system is being strategically deceptive without necessarily requiring behavioural evidence -- would be valuable in mitigating risks from advanced AI systems. But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone. Progress on deception detection likely requires further consideration of these problems.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in large language models, foundation models have been developed for zero-shot time series forecasting, enabling prediction on datasets unseen during pretraining. These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning.
  In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning generally improves zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially for long-term horizons.

arXiv:2511.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common recipe to improve diffusion models at test-time so that samples score highly against a user-specified reward is to introduce the gradient of the reward into the dynamics of the diffusion itself. This procedure is often ill posed, as user-specified rewards are usually only well defined on the data distribution at the end of generation. While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how the flow map enables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing with vision language models.

Abstract: We present Generative Anchored Fields (GAF), a generative model that learns independent endpoint predictors $J$ (noise) and $K$ (data) rather than a trajectory predictor. The velocity field $v=K-J$ emerges from their time-conditioned disagreement. This factorization enables \textit{Transport Algebra}: algebraic operation on learned $\{(J_n,K_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ heads for compositional control. With class-specific $K_n$ heads, GAF supports a rich family of directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic. We achieve strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\times 64$) while uniquely providing compositional generation as an architectural primitive. We further demonstrate, GAF has lossless cyclic transport between its initial and final state with LPIPS=$0.0$. Code available at https://github.com/IDLabMedia/GAF

Abstract: To develop an integrated transcriptome-proteome framework for identifying concurrent biomarkers predictive of radiation response, as measured by survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2), in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomic data were collected from 73 and 46 NSCLC cell lines, respectively. Following preprocessing, 1,605 shared genes were retained for analysis. Feature selection was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression with a frequency-based ranking criterion under five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. Support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined transcriptome-proteome feature sets. Model performance was assessed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Correlation analyses evaluated concordance between RNA and protein expression and the relationships of selected biomarkers with SF2. RNA-protein expression exhibited significant positive correlations (median Pearson's r = 0.363). Independent pipelines identified 20 prioritized gene signatures from transcriptomic, proteomic, and combined datasets. Models trained on single-omic features achieved limited cross-omic generalizability, while the combined model demonstrated balanced predictive accuracy in both datasets (R2=0.461, RMSE=0.120 for transcriptome; R2=0.604, RMSE=0.111 for proteome). This study presents the first proteotranscriptomic framework for SF2 prediction in NSCLC, highlighting the complementary value of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data. The identified concurrent biomarkers capture both transcriptional regulation and functional protein activity, offering mechanistic insights and translational potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in RTL generation, but different models excel on different tasks because of architecture and training differences. Prior work mainly prompts or finetunes a single model. What remains not well studied is how to coordinate multiple different LLMs so they jointly improve RTL quality while also reducing cost, instead of running all models and choosing the best output. We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation.

Abstract: We explore the possibility of exact algorithmic learning with gradient-based methods and introduce a differentiable framework capable of strong length generalization on arithmetic tasks. Our approach centers on Differentiable Finite-State Transducers (DFSTs), a Turing-complete model family that avoids the pitfalls of prior architectures by enabling constant-precision, constant-time generation, and end-to-end log-parallel differentiable training. Leveraging policy-trajectory observations from expert agents, we train DFSTs to perform binary and decimal addition and multiplication. Remarkably, models trained on tiny datasets generalize without error to inputs thousands of times longer than the training examples. These results show that training differentiable agents on structured intermediate supervision could pave the way towards exact gradient-based learning of algorithmic skills.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

<title>Can Synthetic Data Improve Symbolic Regression Extrapolation Performance?</title>

Abstract: Many machine learning models perform well when making predictions within the training data range, but often struggle when required to extrapolate beyond it. Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation. Note: An earlier version of this work appeared in the GECCO 2025 Workshop on Symbolic Regression. This arXiv version corrects several parts of the original submission.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

<title>A Unified and Stable Risk Minimization Framework for Weakly Supervised Learning with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22823</link>

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a practical alternative to fully supervised learning when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible to acquire. However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting.

<title>CausalProfiler: Generating Synthetic Benchmarks for Rigorous and Transparent Evaluation of Causal Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Causal machine learning (Causal ML) aims to answer "what if" questions using machine learning algorithms, making it a promising tool for high-stakes decision-making. Yet, empirical evaluation practices in Causal ML remain limited. Existing benchmarks often rely on a handful of hand-crafted or semi-synthetic datasets, leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods. Based on a set of explicit design choices about the class of causal models, queries, and data considered, the CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths constituting the synthetic causal benchmarks. In this way, Causal ML methods can be rigorously and transparently evaluated under a variety of conditions. This work offers the first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions operating on the three levels of causal reasoning: observation, intervention, and counterfactual. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating several state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions and assumptions, both in and out of the identification regime, illustrating the types of analyses and insights the CausalProfiler enables.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequence modeling have introduced selective SSMs as promising alternatives to Transformer architectures, offering theoretical computational efficiency and sequence processing advantages. A comprehensive understanding of selective SSMs in runtime behavior, resource utilization patterns, and scaling characteristics still remains unexplored, thus obstructing their optimal deployment and further architectural improvements. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2, systematically profiled for performance to assess the design principles that contribute to their efficiency in state-space modeling. A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens. Our findings show that the SSM component, a central part of the selective SSM architecture, demands a significant portion of computational resources compared to other components in the Mamba block. Based on these insights, we propose a pruning technique that selectively removes low-activity states within the SSM component, achieving measurable throughput and memory gains while maintaining accuracy within a moderate pruning regime. This approach results in performance improvements across varying sequence lengths, achieving a 1.14x speedup and reducing memory usage by 11.50\%. These results offer valuable guidance for designing more efficient SSM architectures that can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications.

<title>TARFVAE: Efficient One-Step Generative Time Series Forecasting via TARFLOW based VAE</title>

Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.

<title>CRAwDAD: Causal Reasoning Augmentation with Dual-Agent Debate</title>

arXiv:2511.22854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing "what if" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.

<title>Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment for Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2511.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code is available at [this URL](https://github.com/Luchicken/BriMPR).

Abstract: Numerous graph neural network (GNN)-based algorithms have been proposed to solve graph-based combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but methods to explain their predictions remain largely undeveloped. We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.

We highlight that our method deletes redundancies in the case of a symmetric S^3 distribution. Using our model, we approximate the pushforwards of von Mises-Fisher-induced target densities as well as that of a Z_12-symmetric Boltzmann distribution on S^3 constructed to model benzene.

Abstract: As cities around the world aim to improve walkability and safety, understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior has become increasingly important. This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) enhance reasoning ability of LLMs by providing step-level supervision. However, their widespread adoption is limited due to expensive manual step-level annotation and poor generalization of static training data to novel errors. We introduce Adversarially Trained PRMs (\texttt{APRM}), where a Generator ($G$) learns to produce reasoning errors to deceive a PRM ($R$), while $R$ concurrently learns to detect them. This interaction yields progressively harder negatives for $R$, improving its robustness and generalization to novel errors without requiring manual step-level labels. Averaged across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, \texttt{APRM} improves solver accuracy by $+3.4$ percentage points (pp) over the strongest PRM baseline. \texttt{APRM} achieves gains of $+5.3$ pp on out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a vital role in the early detection, monitoring, and management of various cardiovascular conditions. While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/yuhaoxu99/EnECG.git.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.

Abstract: Traditional curriculum learning proceeds from easy to hard samples, yet defining a reliable notion of difficulty remains elusive. Prior work has used submodular functions to induce difficulty scores in curriculum learning. We reinterpret adaptive subset selection and formulate it as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm corresponds to a submodular function guiding sample selection. We introduce ONLINESUBMOD, a novel online greedy policy that optimizes a utility-driven reward and provably achieves no-regret performance under various sampling regimes. Empirically, ONLINESUBMOD outperforms both traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization approaches across vision and language datasets, showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. More broadly, we show that validationdriven reward metrics offer a principled way to guide the curriculum schedule.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or "experts". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential "plan--act--observe" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family. Additionally, Comp-LLM provides 1.1x--1.7x latency improvement compared to sequential sub-query processing.

Abstract: Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.

<title>A Modular Framework for Rapidly Building Intrusion Predictors</title>

Abstract: We study automated intrusion prediction in an IT system using statistical learning methods. The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them. Using public datasets for training and evaluation, we provide many examples of modular predictors and show how an effective predictor can be dynamically assembled during training from a network of modular components.

<title>Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.23021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.

<title>Delta-XAI: A Unified Framework for Explaining Prediction Changes in Online Time Series Monitoring</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23036</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.23036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Delta-XAI.

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a "Ridge of Optimization" characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to "Spectral Concentration," its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the "Edge of Stability," a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

<title>Freeze, Diffuse, Decode: Geometry-Aware Adaptation of Pretrained Transformer Embeddings for Antimicrobial Peptide Design</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained transformers provide rich, general-purpose embeddings, which are transferred to downstream tasks. However, current transfer strategies: fine-tuning and probing, either distort the pretrained geometric structure of the embeddings or lack sufficient expressivity to capture task-relevant signals. These issues become even more pronounced when supervised data are scarce. Here, we introduce Freeze, Diffuse, Decode (FDD), a novel diffusion-based framework that adapts pre-trained embeddings to downstream tasks while preserving their underlying geometric structure. FDD propagates supervised signal along the intrinsic manifold of frozen embeddings, enabling a geometry-aware adaptation of the embedding space. Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD yields low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations that support property prediction, retrieval, and latent-space interpolation.

Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

<title>A Theoretical Framework for Discovering Groups and Unitary Representations via Tensor Factorization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the HyperCube model, an \textit{operator-valued} tensor factorization architecture that discovers group structures and their unitary representations. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for this inductive bias by decomposing its objective into a term regulating factor scales ($\mathcal{B}$) and a term enforcing directional alignment ($\mathcal{R} \geq 0$). This decomposition isolates the \textit{collinear manifold} ($\mathcal{R}=0$), to which numerical optimization consistently converges for group isotopes. We prove that this manifold admits feasible solutions exclusively for group isotopes, and that within it, $\mathcal{B}$ exerts a variational pressure toward unitarity. To bridge the gap to the global landscape, we formulate a \textit{Collinearity Dominance Conjecture}, supported by empirical observations. Conditional on this dominance, we prove two key results: (1) the global minimum is achieved by the unitary regular representation for groups, and (2) non-group operations incur a strictly higher objective value, formally quantifying the model's inductive bias toward the associative structure of groups (up to isotopy).

Abstract: Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

arXiv:2511.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on energy-constrained devices requires evaluation methods that go beyond accuracy alone. We present a two-stage pipeline for assessing ViT energy efficiency that combines device-agnostic model selection with device-related measurements. We benchmark 13 ViT models on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10, running inference on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (edge device) and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 (mobile GPU). The device-agnostic stage uses the NetScore metric for screening; the device-related stage ranks models with the Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM). Results show that hybrid models such as LeViT_Conv_192 reduce energy by up to 53% on TX2 relative to a ViT baseline (e.g., SAM5=1.44 on TX2/CIFAR-10), while distilled models such as TinyViT-11M_Distilled excel on the mobile GPU (e.g., SAM5=1.72 on RTX 3050/CIFAR-10 and SAM5=0.76 on RTX 3050/ImageNet-1K).

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.

arXiv:2511.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.

Abstract: Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.

Abstract: Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet and social networks has led to an explosion of user-generated content. Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).

Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for physics-informed learning in complex cyber-physical systems governed by differential equations with both unknown dynamics and algebraic invariants. First, we formalize the Hybrid Recurrent Physics-Informed Neural Network (HRPINN), a general-purpose architecture that embeds known physics as a hard structural constraint within a recurrent integrator to learn only residual dynamics. Second, we introduce the Projected HRPINN (PHRPINN), a novel extension that integrates a predict-project mechanism to strictly enforce algebraic invariants by design. The framework is supported by a theoretical analysis of its representational capacity. We validate HRPINN on a real-world battery prognostics DAE and evaluate PHRPINN on a suite of standard constrained benchmarks. The results demonstrate the framework's potential for achieving high accuracy and data efficiency, while also highlighting critical trade-offs between physical consistency, computational cost, and numerical stability, providing practical guidance for its deployment.

<title>Emergent Coordination and Phase Structure in Independent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: A clearer understanding of when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly sought in order to characterize the dynamics of multi-agent learning systems. We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.

Abstract: In traditional EDA flows, layout-level performance metrics are only obtainable after placement and routing, hindering global optimization at earlier stages. Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897. These results demonstrate that ParaGate could provide guidance for global optimization in the synthesis and placement stages.

<title>Distributed Dynamic Associative Memory via Online Convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.

<title>Learning-Augmented Online Bipartite Matching in the Random Arrival Order Model</title>

Abstract: We study the online unweighted bipartite matching problem in the random arrival order model, with $n$ offline and $n$ online vertices, in the learning-augmented setting: The algorithm is provided with untrusted predictions of the types (neighborhoods) of the online vertices. We build upon the work of Choo et al. (ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $\beta$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $\alpha n$ for any constant $0 < \alpha \le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(\beta-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error.

Abstract: Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.

Abstract: We present LFM2, a family of Liquid Foundation Models designed for efficient on-device deployment and strong task capabilities. Using hardware-in-the-loop architecture search under edge latency and memory constraints, we obtain a compact hybrid backbone that combines gated short convolutions with a small number of grouped query attention blocks, delivering up to 2x faster prefill and decode on CPUs compared to similarly sized models. The LFM2 family covers 350M-8.3B parameters, including dense models (350M, 700M, 1.2B, 2.6B) and a mixture-of-experts variant (8.3B total, 1.5B active), all with 32K context length. LFM2's training pipeline includes a tempered, decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation objective that avoids support mismatch; curriculum learning with difficulty-ordered data; and a three-stage post-training recipe of supervised fine-tuning, length-normalized preference optimization, and model merging. Pre-trained on 10-12T tokens, LFM2 models achieve strong results across diverse benchmarks; for example, LFM2-2.6B reaches 79.56% on IFEval and 82.41% on GSM8K. We further build multimodal and retrieval variants: LFM2-VL for vision-language tasks, LFM2-Audio for speech, and LFM2-ColBERT for retrieval. LFM2-VL supports tunable accuracy-latency tradeoffs via token-efficient visual processing, while LFM2-Audio separates audio input and output pathways to enable real-time speech-to-speech interaction competitive with models 3x larger. LFM2-ColBERT provides a low-latency encoder for queries and documents, enabling high-performance retrieval across multiple languages. All models are released with open weights and deployment packages for ExecuTorch, llama.cpp, and vLLM, making LFM2 a practical base for edge applications that need fast, memory-efficient inference and strong task capabilities.

Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of activation functions in learning modular addition with two-layer neural networks. We first establish a sharp expressivity gap: sine MLPs admit width-$2$ exact realizations for any fixed length $m$ and, with bias, width-$2$ exact realizations uniformly over all lengths. In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$. We then provide a novel Natarajan-dimension generalization bound for sine networks, yielding nearly optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p)$ for ERM over constant-width sine networks. We also derive width-independent, margin-based generalization for sine networks in the overparametrized regime and validate it. Empirically, sine networks generalize consistently better than ReLU networks across regimes and exhibit strong length extrapolation.

Abstract: Inverse heat problems refer to the estimation of material thermophysical properties given observed or known heat diffusion behaviour. Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.

Abstract: Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.

Abstract: Current world models lack a unified and controlled setting for systematic evaluation, making it difficult to assess whether they truly capture the underlying rules that govern environment dynamics. In this work, we address this open challenge by introducing the SmallWorld Benchmark, a testbed designed to assess world model capability under isolated and precisely controlled dynamics without relying on handcrafted reward signals. Using this benchmark, we conduct comprehensive experiments in the fully observable state space on representative architectures including Recurrent State Space Model, Transformer, Diffusion model, and Neural ODE, examining their behavior across six distinct domains. The experimental results reveal how effectively these models capture environment structure and how their predictions deteriorate over extended rollouts, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of current modeling paradigms and offering insights into future improvement directions in representation learning and dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has prompted significant interest in their potential applications in medical domains. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on Chinese medical examination questions, encompassing seven medical specialties across two professional levels. We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures. The evaluation demonstrates significant performance gaps between medical specialties, with models generally performing better on cardiovascular and neurology questions compared to gastroenterology and nephrology domains. Furthermore, our analysis indicates minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top-performing models, suggesting robust generalization capabilities. This benchmark provides critical insights for the deployment of LLMs in medical education and clinical decision support systems, highlighting both the promise and current limitations of these technologies in specialized medical contexts.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization properties of dense text embeddings when the embedding backbone is a large language model (LLM) versus when it is a non-LLM encoder, and we study the extent to which spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) model-merging mitigates over-specialization introduced by task-specific adaptation (e.g., LoRA). To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity in recent years with the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with use cases spanning many disciplines and daily lives as well. LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Abstract: This paper argues that dataset structure is important in image recognition tasks (among other tasks). Specifically, we focus on the nature and genesis of correlational structure in the actual datasets upon which DNNs are trained. We argue that DNNs are implementing a widespread methodology in condensed matter physics and materials science that focuses on mesoscale correlation structures that live between fundamental atomic/molecular scales and continuum scales. Specifically, we argue that DNNs that are successful in image classification must be discovering high order correlation functions. It is well-known that DNNs successfully generalize in apparent contravention of standard statistical learning theory. We consider the implications of our discussion for this puzzle.

Abstract: Behavioral health conditions, which include mental health and substance use disorders, are the leading disease burden in the United States. Peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) critically assist individuals facing these conditions by combining mental health services with assistance for needs such as income, employment, and housing. However, limited funds and staffing make it difficult for PROs to address all service user needs. To assist peer providers at PROs with their day-to-day tasks, we introduce PeerCoPilot, a large language model (LLM)-powered assistant that helps peer providers create wellness plans, construct step-by-step goals, and locate organizational resources to support these goals. PeerCoPilot ensures information reliability through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a large database of over 1,300 vetted resources. We conducted human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users and found that over 90% of users supported using PeerCoPilot. Moreover, we demonstrated that PeerCoPilot provides more reliable and specific information than a baseline LLM. PeerCoPilot is now used by a group of 5-10 peer providers at CSPNJ, a large behavioral health organization serving over 10,000 service users, and we are actively expanding PeerCoPilot's use.

<title>Goal-Directed Search Outperforms Goal-Agnostic Memory Compression in Long-Context Memory Tasks</title>

Abstract: How to enable human-like long-term memory in large language models (LLMs) has been a central question for unlocking more general capabilities such as few-shot generalization. Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable. Code for SUMER and all implemented baselines is publicly available at https://github.com/zycyc/SUMER.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled fluent dialogue systems, but most remain reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings such as marketing conversations. To address this limitation, we propose AffectMind, a multimodal affective dialogue agent that performs proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to sustain emotionally aligned and persuasive interactions. AffectMind combines three components: a Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) that continuously updates factual and affective context from text, vision, and prosody; an Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) that jointly models user emotion and purchase intent to adapt persuasion strategies; and a Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) that optimizes emotional coherence and engagement via reinforcement signals from user responses. Experiments on two newly curated marketing dialogue datasets, MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo, show that AffectMind outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in emotional consistency (+26\%), persuasive success rate (+19\%), and long-term user engagement (+23\%), highlighting emotion-grounded proactivity as a key capability for commercial multimodal agents.

Abstract: Current AI agents excel in familiar settings, but fail sharply when faced with novel tasks with unseen vocabularies -- a core limitation of procedural memory systems. We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders. Our benchmark offers the first diagnostic framework separating genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and gives tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

Abstract: Interpretable topic modeling is essential for tracking how research interests evolve within co-author communities. In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.

Abstract: The discovery of next-generation photoinitiators for two-photon polymerization (TPP) is hindered by the absence of large, open datasets containing the quantum-chemical and photophysical properties required to model photodissociation and excited-state behavior. Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design. QuantumChem-200K and the corresponding AI assistant together provide the first scalable platform for high-throughput, LLM-driven photoinitiator screening and accelerated discovery of photosensitive materials.

<title>Orchestrating Dual-Boundaries: An Arithmetic Intensity Inspired Acceleration Framework for Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention for their exceptional performance and inherent potential for parallel decoding. Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.

Abstract: Research increasingly relies on computational methods to analyze experimental data and predict molecular properties. Current approaches often require researchers to use a variety of tools for statistical analysis and machine learning, creating workflow inefficiencies. We present an integrated platform that combines classical statistical methods with Random Forest classification for comprehensive data analysis that can be used in the biological sciences. The platform implements automated hyperparameter optimization, feature importance analysis, and a suite of statistical tests including t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analysis. Our methodology addresses the gap between traditional statistical software, modern machine learning frameworks and biology, by providing a unified interface accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience. The system achieves this through automatic data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and adaptive model configuration based on dataset characteristics. Initial testing protocols are designed to evaluate classification accuracy across diverse chemical datasets with varying feature distributions. This work demonstrates that integrating statistical rigor with machine learning interpretability can accelerate biological discovery workflows while maintaining methodological soundness. The platform's modular architecture enables future extensions to additional machine learning algorithms and statistical procedures relevant to bioinformatics.

<title>Beyond Membership: Limitations of Add/Remove Adjacency in Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Training machine learning models with differential privacy (DP) limits an adversary's ability to infer sensitive information about the training data. It can be interpreted as a bound on adversary's capability to distinguish two adjacent datasets according to chosen adjacency relation. In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation. Our results highlight that the choice of adjacency when reporting DP guarantees is critical when the protection target is per-record attributes rather than membership.

Abstract: The identification and localization of errors is a core task in peer review, yet the exponential growth of scientific output has made it increasingly difficult for human reviewers to reliably detect errors given the limited pool of experts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.

Abstract: System identification in control theory aims to approximate dynamical systems from trajectory data. While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy.

<title>Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training</title>

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

Abstract: This paper examines how institutional belonging shapes long-term development by comparing Spain and Uruguay, two small democracies with similar historical endowments whose trajectories diverged sharply after the 1960s. While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks.

Abstract: Automated detection and classification of marine mammals vocalizations is critical for conservation and management efforts but is hindered by limited annotated datasets and the acoustic complexity of real-world marine environments. Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81. We hope this study encourages further exploration of deep generative models as complementary augmentation strategies to advance acoustic monitoring of threatened marine mammal populations.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto notion of privacy both in theory and in practice. However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].
  In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy.

Abstract: We study Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (SMKL), which is the problem of selecting a sparse convex combination of prespecified kernels for support vector binary classification. Unlike prevailing l1 regularized approaches that approximate a sparsifying penalty, we formulate the problem by imposing an explicit cardinality constraint on the kernel weights and add an l2 penalty for robustness. We solve the resulting non-convex minimax problem via an alternating best response algorithm with two subproblems: the alpha subproblem is a standard kernel SVM dual solved via LIBSVM, while the beta subproblem admits an efficient solution via the Greedy Selector and Simplex Projector algorithm. We reformulate SMKL as a mixed integer semidefinite optimization problem and derive a hierarchy of semidefinite convex relaxations which can be used to certify near-optimality of the solutions returned by our best response algorithm and also to warm start it. On ten UCI benchmarks, our method with random initialization outperforms state-of-the-art MKL approaches in out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 3.34 percentage points (relative to the best performing benchmark) while selecting a small number of candidate kernels in comparable runtime. With warm starting, our method outperforms the best performing benchmark's out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 4.05 percentage points. Our convex relaxations provide a certificate that in several cases, the solution returned by our best response algorithm is the globally optimal solution.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Most scientific domains elicit the development of efficient algorithms and accessible scientific software. This thesis unifies our developments in three broad domains: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for efficient high-dimensional integration, Gaussian process (GP) regression for high-dimensional interpolation with built-in uncertainty quantification, and scientific machine learning (sciML) for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) with mesh-free solvers. For QMC, we built new algorithms for vectorized error estimation and developed QMCPy (https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/): an open-source Python interface to randomized low-discrepancy sequence generators, automatic variable transforms, adaptive error estimation procedures, and diverse use cases. For GPs, we derived new digitally-shift-invariant kernels of higher-order smoothness, developed novel fast multitask GP algorithms, and produced the scalable Python software FastGPs (https://alegresor.github.io/fastgps/). For sciML, we developed a new algorithm capable of machine precision recovery of PDEs with random coefficients. We have also studied a number of applications including GPs for probability of failure estimation, multilevel GPs for the Darcy flow equation, neural surrogates for modeling radiative transfer, and fast GPs for Bayesian multilevel QMC.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative model analysis on a novel gastrointestinal medical imaging dataset, comprised of 4,000 endoscopic images spanning four critical disease classes: Diverticulosis, Neoplasm, Peritonitis, and Ureters. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the study confronts common endoscopic challenges such as variable lighting, fluctuating camera angles, and frequent imaging artifacts. The best performing models, VGG16 and MobileNetV2, each achieved a test accuracy of 96.5%, while Xception reached 94.24%, establishing robust benchmarks and baselines for automated disease classification. In addition to strong classification performance, the approach includes explainable AI via Grad-CAM visualization, enabling identification of image regions most influential to model predictions and enhancing clinical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential for robust, accurate, and interpretable medical image analysis even in complex real-world conditions. This work contributes original benchmarks, comparative insights, and visual explanations, advancing the landscape of gastrointestinal computer-aided diagnosis and underscoring the importance of diverse, clinically relevant datasets and model explainability in medical AI research.

Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are vital datasets for geospatial applications such as hydrological modeling and environmental monitoring. However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.

<title>A Sensitivity Approach to Causal Inference Under Limited Overlap</title>

Abstract: Limited overlap between treated and control groups is a key challenge in observational analysis. Standard approaches like trimming importance weights can reduce variance but introduce a fundamental bias. We propose a sensitivity framework for contextualizing findings under limited overlap, where we assess how irregular the outcome function has to be in order for the main finding to be invalidated. Our approach is based on worst-case confidence bounds on the bias introduced by standard trimming practices, under explicit assumptions necessary to extrapolate counterfactual estimates from regions of overlap to those without. Empirically, we demonstrate how our sensitivity framework protects against spurious findings by quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited overlap.

<title>On the Effect of Regularization on Nonparametric Mean-Variance Regression</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is vital for decision-making and risk assessment in machine learning. Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs. Experiments on UCI datasets and the large-scale ClimSim dataset demonstrate robust calibration performance, effectively quantifying predictive uncertainty.

Abstract: Existing AI bias evaluation benchmarks largely reflect Western perspectives, leaving African contexts underrepresented and enabling harmful stereotypes in applications across various domains. To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies.

Abstract: Academic research generates diverse data sources, and as researchers increasingly use machine learning to assist research tasks, a crucial question arises: Can we build a unified data interface to support the development of machine learning models for various academic tasks? Models trained on such a unified interface can better support human researchers throughout the research process, eventually accelerating knowledge discovery. In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables. ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements. Our experiments across six academic tasks demonstrate that combining cross-source and multi-modal information enables a broader range of tasks, while incorporating graph structures consistently improves performance over baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness of ResearchArcade and its potential to advance research progress.

Abstract: Support vector machines are widely used in machine learning classification tasks, but traditional SVM models suffer from sensitivity to outliers and instability in resampling, which limits their performance in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel rescaled Huberized pinball loss function with asymmetric, non-convex, and smooth properties. Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent. Experimental results on simulated data, UCI datasets, and small-sample crop leaf image classification tasks show that RHPSVM outperforms existing SVM models in both noisy and noise-free scenarios, especially in handling high-dimensional small-sample data.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Abstract: Online pornography and gambling have consistently posed regulatory challenges for governments, threatening both personal assets and privacy. Therefore, it is imperative to research the classification of the newly registered Pornographic and Gambling Domain Names (PGDN). However, scholarly investigation into this topic is limited. Previous efforts in PGDN classification pursue high accuracy using ideal sample data, while others employ up-to-date data from real-world scenarios but achieve lower classification accuracy. This paper introduces the Real-PGDN method, which accomplishes a complete process of timely and comprehensive real-data crawling, feature extraction with feature-missing tolerance, precise PGDN classification, and assessment of application effects in actual scenarios. Our two-level classifier, which integrates CoSENT (BERT-based), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional classification algorithms, achieves a 97.88% precision. The research process amasses the NRD2024 dataset, which contains continuous detection information over 20 days for 1,500,000 newly registered domain names across 6 directions. Results from our case study demonstrate that this method also maintains a forecast precision of over 70% for PGDN that are delayed in usage after registration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Abstract: Modern deep learning techniques focus on extracting intricate information from data to achieve accurate predictions. However, the training datasets may be crowdsourced and include sensitive information, such as personal contact details, financial data, and medical records. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on developing privacy-preserving training algorithms for neural networks that maintain good performance while preserving privacy. In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks. Numerical simulations are further conducted to support our theoretical results.

<title>UCB for Large-Scale Pure Exploration: Beyond Sub-Gaussianity</title>

Abstract: Selecting the best alternative from a finite set represents a broad class of pure exploration problems. Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q > 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for speech synthesis, demonstrating substantial improvements in audio quality and stability. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in vocoders conditioned on mel spectrograms remains constrained, particularly when the conditioning diverges from the training distribution. The recently proposed GLA-Grad model introduced a phase-aware extension to the WaveGrad vocoder that integrated the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) into the reverse process to reduce inconsistencies between generated signals and conditioning mel spectrogram. In this paper, we further improve GLA-Grad through an innovative choice in how to apply the correction. Particularly, we compute the correction term only once, with a single application of GLA, to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Bayesian computational strategies for inference can be inefficient in approximating the posterior distribution in models that exhibit some form of periodicity. This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback. Finally, we analyzed its impact on the marginal posterior distribution.

This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

<title>On the Condition Number Dependency in Bilevel Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization minimizes an objective function, defined by an upper-level problem whose feasible region is the solution of a lower-level problem. We study the oracle complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with first-order methods when the upper-level problem is nonconvex and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent works (Ji et al., ICML 2021; Arbel and Mairal, ICLR 2022; Chen el al., JMLR 2025) achieve a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^4 \epsilon^{-2})$ upper bound that is near-optimal in $\epsilon$. However, the optimal dependency on the condition number $\kappa$ is unknown. In this work, we establish a new $\Omega(\kappa^2 \epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{7/2} \epsilon^{-2})$ upper bound for this problem, establishing the first provable gap between bilevel problems and minimax problems in this setup. Our lower bounds can be extended to various settings, including high-order smooth functions, stochastic oracles, and convex hyper-objectives: (1) For second-order and arbitrarily smooth problems, we show $\Omega(\kappa_y^{13/4} \epsilon^{-12/7})$ and $\Omega(\kappa^{17/10} \epsilon^{-8/5})$ lower bounds, respectively. (2) For convex-strongly-convex problems, we improve the previously best lower bound (Ji and Liang, JMLR 2022) from $\Omega(\kappa /\sqrt{\epsilon})$ to $\Omega(\kappa^{5/4} / \sqrt{\epsilon})$. (3) For smooth stochastic problems, we show an $\Omega(\kappa^4 \epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems enables them to solve an increasing number of tasks, the black-box problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models. While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. This challenge not only pertains to standard XAI techniques but also to human examination and conversational XAI approaches that need access to model internals to interpret them correctly and completely. To this end, we propose conceptually representing such interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks. These include the AI models themselves, as well as control mechanisms grounded in literature. The structural building blocks can then be explained through complementary explanatory building blocks, such as established XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP. The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an unambiguous overview of the underlying system, serving as a communication basis for both human and automated agents, thus aligning human and machine interpretability of the embedded AI models. In this paper, we present our flow-based approach and a selection of building blocks as MATCH: a framework for engineering Multi-Agent Transparent and Controllable Human-centered systems. This research contributes to the field of (conversational) XAI by facilitating the integration of interpretability into existing interactive systems.

Abstract: Images shared on social media often expose geographic cues. While early geolocation methods required expert effort and lacked generalization, the rise of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) now enables accurate geolocation even for ordinary users. However, existing approaches are not optimized for this task. To explore the full potential and associated privacy risks, we present Geo-Detective, an agent that mimics human reasoning and tool use for image geolocation inference. It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the "unknown" prediction rate by more than 50.6%. We further explore multiple defense strategies and find that Geo-Detective exhibits stronger robustness, highlighting the need for more effective privacy safeguards.

<title>What Is the Optimal Ranking Score Between Precision and Recall? We Can Always Find It and It Is Rarely $F_1$</title>

Abstract: Ranking methods or models based on their performance is of prime importance but is tricky because performance is fundamentally multidimensional. In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_\beta$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\beta$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\beta$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard. (3) We provide theoretical tools and a closed-form expression to find the optimal value for $\beta$ for any distribution or set of performances, and we illustrate their use on six case studies.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Abstract: The requirement for large-scale global simulations of plasma is an ongoing challenge in both space and laboratory plasma physics. Any simulation based on a fluid model inherently requires a closure relation for the high order plasma moments. This review compiles and analyses the recent surge of machine learning approaches developing improved plasma closure models capable of capturing kinetic phenomena within plasma fluid models. The purpose of this review is both to collect and analyse the various methods employed on the plasma closure problem, including both equation discovery methods and neural network surrogate approaches, as well as to provide a general overview of the state of the problem. In particular, we highlight the challenges of developing a data-driven closure as well as the direction future work should take toward addressing these challenges, in the pursuit of a computationally viable large-scale global simulation.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

Abstract: We apply physics-informed machine learning (PIML) to solve inverse problems in holography and classical mechanics, focusing on neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving non-linear differential equations of motion. First, we introduce holographic inverse problems and demonstrate how PIML can reconstruct bulk spacetime and effective potentials from boundary quantum data. To illustrate this, two case studies are explored: the QCD equation of state in holographic QCD and $T$-linear resistivity in holographic strange metals. Additionally, we explicitly show how such holographic problems can be analogized to inverse problems in classical mechanics, modeling frictional forces with neural networks. We also explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks, offering more efficient solutions in certain cases. This manuscript aim to provide a systematic framework for using neural networks in inverse problems, serving as a comprehensive reference for researchers in machine learning for high-energy physics, with methodologies that also have broader applications in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Model (LLM) services at the edge benefits latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications. However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.
  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

Abstract: Determinantal varieties -- the sets of bounded-rank matrices or tensors -- have attracted growing interest in low-rank optimization. The tangent cone to low-rank sets is widely studied and underpins a range of geometric methods. The second-order geometry, which encodes curvature information, is more intricate. In this work, we develop a unified framework to derive explicit formulas for both first- and second-order tangent sets to various low-rank sets, including low-rank matrices, tensors, symmetric matrices, and positive semidefinite matrices. The framework also accommodates the intersection of a low-rank set and another set satisfying mild assumptions, thereby yielding a tangent intersection rule. Through the lens of tangent sets, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a nonsmooth problem and its smooth parameterization share equivalent second-order stationary points. Moreover, we exploit tangent sets to characterize optimality conditions for low-rank optimization and prove that verifying second-order optimality is NP-hard. In a separate line of analysis, we investigate variational geometry of the graph of the normal cone to matrix varieties, deriving the explicit Bouligand tangent cone, Fr\'echet and Mordukhovich normal cones to the graph. These results are further applied to develop optimality conditions for low-rank bilevel programs.

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their applications in diverse domains, such as surveillance, disaster management, agriculture, and defense, have revolutionized modern technology. While the potential benefits of swarm-based UAV networks are growing significantly, they are vulnerable to various security attacks that can jeopardize the overall mission success by degrading their performance, disrupting decision-making, and compromising the trajectory planning process. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in identifying potential security attacks to ensure the secure operation of UAV swarm networks. However, conventional IDS primarily focuses on binary classification with resource-intensive neural networks and faces challenges, including latency, privacy breaches, increased performance overhead, and model drift. This research aims to address these challenges by developing a novel lightweight and federated continuous learning-based IDS scheme. Our proposed model facilitates decentralized training across diverse UAV swarms to ensure data heterogeneity and privacy. The performance evaluation of our model demonstrates significant improvements, with classification accuracies of 99.45% on UKM-IDS, 99.99% on UAV-IDS, 96.85% on TLM-UAV dataset, and 98.05% on Cyber-Physical datasets.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential across both general and domain-specific tasks. However, there is a growing concern regarding their lack of sensitivity, factual incorrectness in responses, inconsistent expressions of empathy, bias, hallucinations, and overall inability to capture the depth and complexity of human understanding, especially in low-resource and sensitive domains such as psychology. To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift" in therapeutic settings. Our work contributes not only to the MI community by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to address data scarcity in low-resource domains but also critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy.

Abstract: Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\'ordoba-C\'ordoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), enabling rapid adaptation to diverse domains. In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

<title>Language-conditioned world model improves policy generalization by reading environmental descriptions</title>

Abstract: To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying "what to do". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.

Abstract: Ghost imaging leverages a single-pixel detector with no spatial resolution to acquire object echo intensity signals, which are correlated with illumination patterns to reconstruct an image. This architecture inherently mitigates scattering interference between the object and the detector but sensitive to scattering between the light source and the object. To address this challenge, we propose an optical diffraction neural networks (ODNNs) assisted ghost imaging method for imaging through dynamic scattering media. In our scheme, a set of fixed ODNNs, trained on simulated datasets, is incorporated into the experimental optical path to actively correct random distortions induced by dynamic scattering media. Experimental validation using rotating single-layer and double-layer ground glass confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our scheme can also be combined with physics-prior-based reconstruction algorithms, enabling high-quality imaging under undersampled conditions. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for imaging through dynamic scattering media, which can be extended to other imaging systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates fake news detection as a downstream evaluation of Transformer representations, benchmarking encoder-only and decoder-only pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL) as frozen embedders paired with lightweight classifiers. Through controlled preprocessing comparing pooling versus padding and neural versus linear heads, results demonstrate that contextual self-attention encodings consistently transfer effectively. BERT embeddings combined with logistic regression outperform neural baselines on LIAR dataset splits, while analyses of sequence length and aggregation reveal robustness to truncation and advantages from simple max or average pooling. This work positions attention-based token encoders as robust, architecture-centric foundations for veracity tasks, isolating Transformer contributions from classifier complexity.

Abstract: Understanding past and present maritime activity patterns is critical for navigation safety, environmental assessment, and commercial operations. An increasing number of services now openly provide positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) via ground-based receivers. We show that coastal vessel activity can be reconstructed from open access data with high accuracy, even with limited data quality and incomplete receiver coverage. For three months of open AIS data in the Baltic Sea from August to October 2024, we present (i) cleansing and reconstruction methods to improve the data quality, and (ii) a journey model that converts AIS message data into vessel counts, traffic estimates, and spatially resolved vessel density at a resolution of $\sim$400 m. Vessel counts are provided, along with their uncertainties, for both moving and stationary activity. Vessel density maps also enable the identification of port locations, and we infer the most crowded and busiest coastal areas in the Baltic Sea. We find that on average, $\gtrsim$4000 vessels simultaneously operate in the Baltic Sea, and more than 300 vessels enter or leave the area each day. Our results agree within 20\% with previous studies relying on proprietary data.

arXiv:2511.23017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable positioning in GNSS-challenged environments remains a critical challenge for navigation systems. Tightly coupled GNSS/IMU fusion improves robustness but remains vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. We present a robust and adaptive factor graph-based fusion framework that directly integrates GNSS pseudorange measurements with IMU preintegration factors and incorporates the Barron loss, a general robust loss function that unifies several m-estimators through a single tunable parameter. By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning. The method is implemented in an extended GTSAM framework and evaluated on the UrbanNav dataset. The proposed solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO, and achieves even larger improvements over extended Kalman filter (EKF) baselines in urban canyon environments. These results highlight the benefits of Barron loss in enhancing the resilience of GNSS/IMU-based navigation in urban and signal-compromised environments.

Abstract: Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.

Abstract: Standard Occupational Classifiers (SOC) are systems used to categorize and classify different types of jobs and occupations based on their similarities in terms of job duties, skills, and qualifications. Integrating these facets with Big Data from job advertisement offers the prospect to investigate labour demand that is specific to various occupations. This project investigates the use of recent developments in natural language processing to construct a classifier capable of assigning an occupation code to a given job advertisement. We develop various classifiers for both UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC, using different Language Models. We find that an ensemble model, which combines Google BERT and a Neural Network classifier while considering job title, description, and skills, achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Specifically, the ensemble model exhibited a classification accuracy of up to 61% for the lower (or fourth) tier of SOC, and 72% for the third tier of SOC. This model could provide up to date, accurate information on the evolution of the labour market using job advertisements.

<title>Buffer replay enhances the robustness of multimodal learning under missing-modality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

Abstract: Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average. Code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/db-SP.

Abstract: Purpose To conduct a systematic review of machine learning models for predicting violent behaviour by synthesising and appraising their validity, usefulness, and performance.
  Methods We systematically searched nine bibliographic databases and Google Scholar up to September 2025 for development and/or validation studies on machine learning methods for predicting all forms of violent behaviour. We synthesised the results by summarising discrimination and calibration performance statistics and evaluated study quality by examining risk of bias and clinical utility.
  Results We identified 38 studies reporting the development and validation of 40 models. Most studies reported Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the discrimination statistic with a range of 0.68-0.99. Only eight studies reported calibration performance, and three studies reported external validation. 31 studies had a high risk of bias, mainly in the analysis domain, and three studies had low risk of bias. The overall clinical utility of violence prediction models is poor, as indicated by risks of overfitting due to small samples, lack of transparent reporting, and low generalisability.
  Conclusion Although black box machine learning models currently have limited applicability in clinical settings, they may show promise for identifying high-risk individuals. We recommend five key considerations for violence prediction modelling: (i) ensuring methodological quality (e.g. following guidelines) and interdisciplinary collaborations; (ii) using black box algorithms only for highly complex data; (iii) incorporating dynamic predictions to allow for risk monitoring; (iv) developing more trustworthy algorithms using explainable methods; and (v) applying causal machine learning approaches where appropriate.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

Abstract: Recent years have shown that malware attacks still happen with high frequency. Malware experts seek to categorize and classify incoming samples to confirm their trustworthiness or prove their maliciousness. One of the ways in which groups of malware samples can be identified is through malware clustering. Despite the efforts of the community, malware clustering which incorporates benign samples has been under-explored. Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind.

Abstract: In traditional multivariate data analysis, dimension reduction and regression have been treated as distinct endeavors. Established techniques such as principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression traditionally compute latent components as intermediary steps -- although with different underlying criteria -- before proceeding with the regression analysis. In this paper, we introduce an innovative regression methodology named PLS-integrated Lasso (PLS-Lasso) that integrates the concept of dimension reduction directly into the regression process. We present two distinct formulations for PLS-Lasso, denoted as PLS-Lasso-v1 and PLS-Lasso-v2, along with clear and effective algorithms that ensure convergence to global optima. PLS-Lasso-v1 and PLS-Lasso-v2 are compared with Lasso on the task of financial index tracking and show promising results.

Summary:<br>
Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is crucial for reducing latency and improving throughput. Traditional strategies like FCFS can lead to HOL blocking, delaying shorter tasks. PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler, approximates SJF scheduling through margin ranking loss, improving serving efficiency. Integrated into vLLM, PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions, predicting task ordering based on response length to reduce latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across LLMs and real-world datasets demonstrate PARS's performance improvements, even for reasoning workloads. Cross-model evaluations show the design's generalizability, allowing effective scheduling across different LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.

<div> Keywords: time series, forecasting, multimodal, cross-channel dependencies, VIFO 

Summary:
The article introduces the VIFO model, a cross-modal forecasting approach that leverages pre-trained large vision models to extract complex patterns from multivariate time series data. VIFO converts time series data into images, allowing the pre-trained model to recognize cross-channel dependencies that are often overlooked in traditional models. By freezing most of the parameters of the large vision model and training only a small percentage, VIFO achieves competitive forecasting performance on various benchmarks. This approach effectively combines information from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting accuracy and efficiency. VIFO offers an innovative solution for capturing cross-variable relationships in time series data and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in the field of forecasting. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing cross-variable relationships in

Summary: 
This paper introduces transferable frequency-aware attacks as a novel approach to improving the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of real-world noise and intentional perturbations. These attacks allow for exploration of high- and low-frequency components to enhance the explainability of DNNs. The proposed attribution method, Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer (FAMPE), surpasses current state-of-the-art methods by achieving an average gain of 13.02% in Insertion Score. Through ablation studies, the role of both high- and low-frequency components in enhancing explainability is also evaluated. This research aims to address the challenges of ensuring the reliability of DNNs and provides a promising avenue for further refinement of attribution methods in this context. <br> <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge. To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches. Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high- and low-frequency components in explainability.

<div> Keywords: Pruning, Language Models, Structured Sparsity, ADMM, Memory Efficiency

Summary:
Structured pruning is essential for efficiently scaling large language models (LLMs). Traditional global pruning requires excessive memory, while local pruning neglects inter-layer dependencies. The proposed STRUPRUNE framework combines the benefits of structured and local pruning by decomposing the global pruning problem into manageable subproblems. It utilizes an ADMM-based approach to integrate structured sparsity into the pruning process, achieving a memory efficiency of O(âˆšN) for billion-parameter models. STRUPRUNE's closed-form analytical solution provides layer-wise sparsity allocation rules, and an energy-based framework adapts to varying layer importance. Experimental results show that STRUPRUNE matches the performance of global structured pruning while significantly reducing memory costs, making it suitable for practical deployment at a large scale. <div>

Abstract: Pruning is critical for scaling large language models (LLMs). Global pruning achieves strong performance but requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning while reducing memory cost from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.

<div> active learning, multimodal data, deep learning, cross-modal alignment, annotation cost 

Summary:
Active learning is a method to reduce annotation cost in deep learning, but existing algorithms focus primarily on unimodal data, neglecting the challenges in multimodal learning. This study introduces a framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where acquiring cross-modal alignments is prioritized over obtaining labels on pre-aligned pairs. A new algorithm is developed that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, resulting in linear-time acquisition suitable for both pool-based and streaming-based scenarios. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the approach significantly reduces multimodal annotation cost while maintaining performance. For example, on the ColorSwap dataset, annotation requirements are reduced by up to 40% without sacrificing accuracy. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.

Summary:
Neural operator architectures were evaluated for rapid prediction of brain displacement fields to enable real-time traumatic brain injury (TBI) modeling. The study formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem using subject-specific anatomical MRI and MRE stiffness maps. Four architectures were assessed across relevant frequencies, with Multi-Grid FNO achieving the highest accuracy and preserving fine-scale features. Factorized FNO showed faster convergence, while Deep Operator Network offered the fastest inference speed. Overall, neural operators significantly reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over 69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$ computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient, resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable, on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health contexts.

Summary: 
Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) have shown high efficiency in inference but face challenges such as vanishing gradients and high training cost. By reparametrizing logic gate neurons, the authors propose a solution that reduces model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. The new parametrization also maintains stable or superior accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. This innovation addresses issues related to discretization errors and gradient vanishing, allowing for scalability and improved training efficiency in DLGNs. <div>
arXiv:2510.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) exhibit extraordinary efficiency at inference while sustaining competitive accuracy. But vanishing gradients, discretization errors, and high training cost impede scaling these networks. Even with dedicated parameter initialization schemes from subsequent works, increasing depth still harms accuracy. We show that the root cause of these issues lies in the underlying parametrization of logic gate neurons themselves. To overcome this issue, we propose a reparametrization that also shrinks the parameter size logarithmically in the number of inputs per gate. For binary inputs, this already reduces the model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. On top of that, we show that the accuracy on CIFAR-100 remains stable and sometimes superior to the original parametrization.

Abstract: Many methods aim to enhance time series forecasting by decomposing the series through intricate model structures and prior knowledge, yet they are inevitably limited by computational complexity and the robustness of the assumptions. Our research uncovers that in the complex domain and higher-order hypercomplex spaces, the characteristic frequencies of time series naturally decrease. Leveraging this insight, we propose Numerion, a time series forecasting model based on multiple hypercomplex spaces. Specifically, grounded in theoretical support, we generalize linear layers and activation functions to hypercomplex spaces of arbitrary power-of-two dimensions and introduce a novel Real-Hypercomplex-Real Domain Multi-Layer Perceptron (RHR-MLP) architecture. Numerion utilizes multiple RHR-MLPs to map time series into hypercomplex spaces of varying dimensions, naturally decomposing and independently modeling the series, and adaptively fuses the latent patterns exhibited in different spaces through a dynamic fusion mechanism. Experiments validate the model`s performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets. Visualizations and quantitative analyses comprehensively demonstrate the ability of multi-dimensional RHR-MLPs to naturally decompose time series and reveal the tendency of higher dimensional hypercomplex spaces to capture lower frequency features.

Summary:
Diffusion Router (DR) presents a solution for universal multi-domain translation (MDT) by enabling both direct and indirect translations between any pair of K domains using only K-1 paired datasets with a central domain. The unified diffusion-based framework of DR utilizes a noise predictor conditioned on source and target domain labels to model all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations, allowing for indirect mappings through the central domain. Furthermore, DR introduces a scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings effectively. Through evaluation on various UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results, reduces sampling costs, and enables tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. This establishes DR as a versatile and scalable framework for universal translation across multiple domains. <br> <div>

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces Hierarchical Preference Learning (HPL) for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents by leveraging preference signals at multiple granularities. HPL addresses the granularity mismatch in preference-based offline methods by incorporating trajectory- and step-level DPO and introducing a dual-layer curriculum for group-level preference optimization. HPL decomposes expert trajectories into action groups, generates contrasting suboptimal groups for fine-grained preference learning, and implements a curriculum scheduler for organizing the learning process based on group length and sample difficulty. Experiment results on three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing methods by effectively integrating preference signals across multiple granularities and enabling the agent to solve tasks ranging from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents are increasingly tasked with solving complex, long-horizon problems. Aligning these agents via preference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch. Trajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit assignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of multi-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical Preference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents by leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While HPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy stability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization guided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert trajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates contrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained, sub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL introduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from simple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group length, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by the reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO loss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities, while the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a wide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.

Summary:  
- Adversarial machine learning involves training classifiers to defend against attacks from active adversaries in scenarios like spam filtering and malware detection.  
- Pessimistic bilevel optimization is effective in training resilient classifiers by modeling scenarios as a game between learner and adversary.  
- Existing approaches with unrestricted adversaries may lead to overly pessimistic and unrealistic models, impacting classifier performance.  
- A constrained pessimistic bilevel optimization model restricts adversary movements, leading to a solution that better reflects reality and improves classifier performance.  
- Experimental results demonstrate that the constrained model outperforms existing approaches on average. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning concerns situations in which learners face attacks from active adversaries. Such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the everimproving generation of malicious data. Pessimistic Bilevel optimisation has been shown to be an effective method of training resilient classifiers against such adversaries. By modelling these scenarios as a game between the learner and the adversary, we anticipate how the adversary will modify their data and then train a resilient classifier accordingly. However, since existing pessimistic bilevel approaches feature an unrestricted adversary, the model is vulnerable to becoming overly pessimistic and unrealistic. When finding the optimal solution that defeats the classifier, it is possible that the adversary's data becomes nonsensical and loses its intended nature. Such an adversary will not properly reflect reality, and consequently, will lead to poor classifier performance when implemented on real-world data. By constructing a constrained pessimistic bilevel optimisation model, we restrict the adversary's movements and identify a solution that better reflects reality. We demonstrate through experiments that this model performs, on average, better than the existing approach.

Summary:
In this study, the authors introduce SciTS, a benchmark for scientific time series analysis spanning various domains and tasks. They evaluate 17 models, including text-only and multimodal large language models (LLMs), as well as unified time series models, finding that general-purpose LLMs exhibit better generalizability compared to specialized time series models. They note limitations in representing time series as text or images, leading to decreased performance due to long sequences or loss of numerical precision. To address these issues, the authors introduce TimeOmni, a framework that enables LLMs to comprehend and generate time series data while maintaining compatibility with general-purpose LLM training methods. This work fills a gap in both benchmarking approaches and modeling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way for LLMs to effectively understand and generate complex temporal scientific data. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention. Time series, as a fundamental modality in scientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in current multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or convert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive scientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time series models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their effectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains unclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12 scientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and multivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz in frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal LLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs exhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We then introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to understand and generate time series while remaining compatible with general-purpose LLM training. This work fills a gap in both dedicated benchmarks and modelling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way for LLMs to understand and generate complex temporal scientific data.

Summary: 
On-demand ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft face the challenge of efficiently matching passengers to available vehicles in real-time. Traditional methods such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggle due to the vast observation and action spaces. To address these limitations, Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning method, is proposed. It employs an action decomposition strategy to handle the extensive action space and utilizes a BERT-based network with an attention mechanism to capture complex relationships among drivers and orders. Testing on real-world data from Manhattan shows that Triple-BERT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by improving order serving rates by 4.26% and reducing pickup times by 22.25%. The code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .

<div> Test-time adaptation, entropy threshold, reliable samples, POEM, Adapt Branch <br>
Summary: The paper introduces a new method, POEM, for test-time adaptation that focuses on exploring reliable samples overlooked by existing methods due to predefined entropy thresholds. By incorporating an Adapt Branch network, POEM strikes a balance between domain-agnostic representations and high performance on target data. Extensive experiments across various architectures show that POEM outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts while remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is validated through thorough analyses and ablation studies. Additionally, the core idea of POEM can be used as an augmentation strategy to enhance the performance of current test-time adaptation approaches. The source code for POEM is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ycarobot/POEM.<br>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to transfer knowledge from a source model to unknown test data with potential distribution shifts in an online manner. Many existing TTA methods rely on entropy as a confidence metric to optimize the model. However, these approaches are sensitive to the predefined entropy threshold, influencing which samples are chosen for model adaptation. Consequently, potentially reliable target samples are often overlooked and underutilized. For instance, a sample's entropy might slightly exceed the threshold initially, but fall below it after the model is updated. Such samples can provide stable supervised information and offer a normal range of gradients to guide model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a general approach, \underline{POEM}, to promote TTA via ex\underline{\textbf{p}}loring the previously unexpl\underline{\textbf{o}}red reliabl\underline{\textbf{e}} sa\underline{\textbf{m}}ples. Additionally, we introduce an extra Adapt Branch network to strike a balance between extracting domain-agnostic representations and achieving high performance on target data. Comprehensive experiments across multiple architectures demonstrate that POEM consistently outperforms existing TTA methods in both challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts, while remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is evaluated through extensive analyses and thorough ablation studies. Moreover, the core idea behind POEM can be employed as an augmentation strategy to boost the performance of existing TTA approaches.

<div> meta-awareness, reasoning models, training pipeline, self-alignment, accuracy improvement

Summary: The study introduces a training pipeline called MASA that enhances meta-awareness in reasoning models, improving accuracy without the need for external training sources. By aligning meta-predictions with true rollouts, significant performance gains are achieved. MASA filters out irrelevant prompts and truncates lengthy rollouts to improve training efficiency. Results show a 1.28x speedup in training and a 19.3% accuracy gain on in-domain tasks, along with a 6.2% average improvement across mathematics benchmarks. Out-of-domain generalization is enhanced, with a 3.87% boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08% accuracy gain on 13 benchmarks spanning various domains. The study demonstrates the importance of meta-awareness in reasoning models and the effectiveness of self-alignment techniques in enhancing model performance and generalization. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on reasoning models explore the meta-awareness of language models, the ability to know how to think by itself. We argue that large reasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe misalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit that aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant performance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline that boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced meta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing meta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training sources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover, our method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts that are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when they are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our strategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training efficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over 1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on AIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks. Training with meta-cognitive guidance enhances out-of-domain generalization, giving a 3.87 % boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08 % overall accuracy gain across 13 benchmarks spanning logical, scientific, and coding domains.

Summary:<br>
Zero-Shot Learning is crucial for General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems operating in open-world scenarios. Semantic spaces bridge seen and unseen classes but can be noisy. A partitioning scheme simulates unseen conditions, enabling attribute relevance assessment without semantic information. Two feature-selection strategies, embedded feature selection and evolutionary computation, improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy. RFS is efficient and competitive with critical hyperparameters, while GA explores the search space broadly without such dependence. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm semantic spaces' inherent redundancy and the effectiveness of the partitioning scheme for refinement under inductive conditions. <div>

Abstract: Zero-Shot Learning is an important paradigm within General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems, particularly in those that operate in open-world scenarios where systems must adapt to new tasks dynamically. Semantic spaces play a pivotal role as they bridge seen and unseen classes, but whether human-annotated or generated by a machine learning model, they often contain noisy, redundant, or irrelevant attributes that hinder performance. To address this, we introduce a partitioning scheme that simulates unseen conditions in an inductive setting (which is the most challenging), allowing attribute relevance to be assessed without access to semantic information from unseen classes. Within this framework, we study two complementary feature-selection strategies and assess their generalisation. The first adapts embedded feature selection to the particular demands of ZSL, turning model-driven rankings into meaningful semantic pruning; the second leverages evolutionary computation to directly explore the space of attribute subsets more broadly. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (AWA2, CUB, SUN, aPY, FLO) show that both methods consistently improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy, but in complementary ways: RFS is efficient and competitive though dependent on critical hyperparameters, whereas GA is more costly yet explores the search space more broadly and avoids such dependence. These results confirm that semantic spaces are inherently redundant and highlight the proposed partitioning scheme as an effective tool to refine them under inductive conditions.

Summary:
In a new study, researchers introduce a novel approach using neural networks to predict temperature and heat flux fields in machine tools. This allows for the computation and correction of various types of thermal errors with modular downstream components. The neural network is trained using data from the finite element method under different initial conditions and utilizes a correlation-based selection strategy to identify key measurement points, reducing hardware requirements during inference. The study benchmarks several time-series neural network architectures and finds accurate and cost-effective prediction of temperature and heat flux fields.

arXiv:2510.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal errors in machine tools significantly impact machining precision and productivity. Traditional thermal error correction/compensation methods rely on measured temperature-deformation fields or on transfer functions. Most existing data-driven compensation strategies employ neural networks (NNs) to directly predict thermal errors or specific compensation values. While effective, these approaches are tightly bound to particular error types, spatial locations, or machine configurations, limiting their generality and adaptability. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict high-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The proposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide range of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is trained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying initial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that identifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware requirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art time-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal Convolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for specific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to unseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of temperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and generalisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.

<div> orthogonal, Monte Carlo Dropout, LoRA, semantic vectors, compositionality
<br>
Summary:<br> 
The article introduces Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a method to ensure orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without additional time complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning technique for large models, focuses on training modules to represent specific concepts like objects or styles. However, merging multiple LoRAs can lead to interference among their semantic vectors. Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout aims to keep merged LoRAs orthogonal to prevent direct interference. Despite this, empirical analysis shows that orthogonality alone does not necessarily result in semantic disentanglement or compositionality as desired. The research suggests that achieving true semantic compositionality may require more than just ensuring orthogonality between LoRAs, prompting a reevaluation of the role of orthogonality in adapter merging. <div>

Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style. When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the misuse of modern text-to-image models for creating harmful content and introduces the concept of machine unlearning to selectively remove knowledge from models. It highlights the challenges of forgetting specific concepts and the emergence of unlearned concepts through adversarial prompts. The Memory Self-Regeneration task and MemoRa strategy are proposed to support effective recovery of lost knowledge. The importance of robustness in knowledge retrieval as an evaluation measure for unlearning techniques is emphasized. The study reveals two distinct ways of forgetting: short-term, with quick recall, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging. Overall, the paper sheds light on the complexities of forgetting in machine learning models and underscores the need for more robust and effective unlearning techniques. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The impressive capability of modern text-to-image models to generate realistic visuals has come with a serious drawback: they can be misused to create harmful, deceptive or unlawful content. This has accelerated the push for machine unlearning. This new field seeks to selectively remove specific knowledge from a model's training data without causing a drop in its overall performance. However, it turns out that actually forgetting a given concept is an extremely difficult task. Models exposed to attacks using adversarial prompts show the ability to generate so-called unlearned concepts, which can be not only harmful but also illegal. In this paper, we present considerations regarding the ability of models to forget and recall knowledge, introducing the Memory Self-Regeneration task. Furthermore, we present MemoRa strategy, which we consider to be a regenerative approach supporting the effective recovery of previously lost knowledge. Moreover, we propose that robustness in knowledge retrieval is a crucial yet underexplored evaluation measure for developing more robust and effective unlearning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that forgetting occurs in two distinct ways: short-term, where concepts can be quickly recalled, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging.

Summary:
- Introducing reasoning data during pretraining enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities.
- Front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical, providing foundational capabilities that later fine-tuning cannot replicate.
- Pretraining benefits most from diverse reasoning patterns, while SFT is more sensitive to data quality.
- High-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT.
- Naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. 

<br><br>Summary: 
Introducing reasoning data during pretraining significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities, establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage fine-tuning. Pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns, while SFT is more sensitive to data quality. High-quality pretraining data has latent effects that are activated only after SFT, highlighting the importance of strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models. Naively scaling SFT data can have detrimental effects, underscoring the need for a principled approach to data allocation during the training process. <div>
arXiv:2510.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs revolves around post-training on high-quality, reasoning-intensive data. While emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT, even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models.

Summary:
Concept Trees, inspired by causal inference, use spectral decomposition to uncover the internal structure and stabilization of concepts in large-scale foundation models. By identifying branching Concept Paths through principal directions, Concept Trees reveal how concepts diverge from shared representations into linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations in medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and political decision-making demonstrate the effectiveness of Concept Trees in recovering semantic hierarchies and disentangling latent concepts across diverse domains. This framework offers a powerful tool for analyzing conceptual representations in deep models and advancing the field of interpretable AI. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models demonstrate strong performance across language, vision, and reasoning tasks. However, how they internally structure and stabilize concepts remains elusive. Inspired by causal inference, we introduce the MindCraft framework built upon Concept Trees. By applying spectral decomposition at each layer and linking principal directions into branching Concept Paths, Concept Trees reconstruct the hierarchical emergence of concepts, revealing exactly when they diverge from shared representations into linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across multiple domains. The Concept Tree establishes a widely applicable and powerful framework that enables in-depth analysis of conceptual representations in deep models, marking a significant step forward in the foundation of interpretable AI.

Abstract: Climate anomalies significantly impact terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics, necessitating robust methods for detecting and analyzing anomalous behavior in plant productivity. This study presents a novel application of variational autoencoders (VAE) for identifying extreme events in gross primary productivity (GPP) from Community Earth System Model version 2 simulations across four AR6 regions in the Continental United States. We compare VAE-based anomaly detection with traditional singular spectral analysis (SSA) methods across three time periods: 1850-80, 1950-80, and 2050-80 under the SSP585 scenario. The VAE architecture employs three dense layers and a latent space with an input sequence length of 12 months, trained on a normalized GPP time series to reconstruct the GPP and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extreme events are defined using 5th percentile thresholds applied to both VAE and SSA anomalies. Results demonstrate strong regional agreement between VAE and SSA methods in spatial patterns of extreme event frequencies, despite VAE producing higher threshold values (179-756 GgC for VAE vs. 100-784 GgC for SSA across regions and periods). Both methods reveal increasing magnitudes and frequencies of negative carbon cycle extremes toward 2050-80, particularly in Western and Central North America. The VAE approach shows comparable performance to established SSA techniques, while offering computational advantages and enhanced capability for capturing non-linear temporal dependencies in carbon cycle variability. Unlike SSA, the VAE method does not require one to define the periodicity of the signals in the data; it discovers them from the data.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to address the challenges of training-free parameter optimization and quantization difficulties faced by LLMs. PT$^2$-LLM utilizes an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer with a two-stage refinement pipeline consisting of Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF) and Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA) to minimize quantization error and improve precision. Additionally, a Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy is proposed to enhance quantization and mitigate outlier effects. Experimental results show that PT$^2$-LLM achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art 2-bit Post-Training Quantization methods, with lower memory cost and improved speed for prefill and decoding. The code and models for PT$^2$-LLM will be made available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but their large memory and compute demands hinder deployment. Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique, delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency. However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA), which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs. In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve end-to-end speedup. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PT2-LLM.

<br>
Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to integrate data from different modalities into a shared embedding space. However, the phenomenon of the modality gap, where representations from different modalities occupy separate regions of the embedding space, has been observed. This study introduces a theoretical framework to analyze optimal representations and modality alignment in MCL. It is proven that without constraints, the modality gap diminishes. Under the subspace constraint, causing dimension collapse, the gap converges to the smallest angle between the distinct hyperplanes. The role of the modality gap in downstream performance is linked to the alignment between sample pairs, which cannot be perfectly achieved under the subspace constraint. However, perfect alignment can be attained through hyperplane rotation or shared space projection.This research highlights the impact of dimension collapse as the underlying cause of the modality gap and provides insights into achieving alignment and performance optimization in multimodal contrastive learning. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to embed data from different modalities in a shared embedding space. However, empirical evidence shows that representations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of embedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover, experimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream performance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1) What causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To address these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality alignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any constraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero. Under the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall into two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap converges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result identifies \emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality gap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be perfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences downstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We prove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be achieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection.

Summary: 
The article addresses the limitations of current exploration methods in reinforcement learning with human feedback, showing unintentional biases towards high-probability regions of the reference model. It introduces the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB) framework as a solution to this issue, ensuring exploration in uncertain regions while satisfying the optimism principle. GEB regulates rewards based on a reference model, outperforming existing bonuses in various tasks and language model backbones. The framework unifies previous heuristic bonuses and extends to different divergence settings, providing a principled and effective approach for optimistic exploration in reinforcement learning with human feedback. GEB offers a theoretical basis and practical implementation for improving sample efficiency and promoting discovery in RLHF domains.

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

<div> decision boundary, large language models, decision potential surface, K-DPS, algorithm 

Summary: 
The paper introduces Decision Potential Surface (DPS) as a new concept for analyzing decision boundaries in large language models (LLMs). DPS is based on the confidence levels in distinguishing different sampling sequences for each input, providing insights into the potential of decision boundaries. The zero-height isohypse in DPS represents the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions indicating decision regions. The authors propose the K-DPS algorithm, which approximates an LLM's decision boundary with minimal error using a finite number of sequence samplings. The paper includes theoretical bounds for absolute error, expected error, and error concentration between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, showing that errors can be controlled by the number of samples. Empirical experiments across various LLMs and datasets validate the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Decision boundary, the subspace of inputs where a machine learning model assigns equal classification probabilities to two classes, is pivotal in revealing core model properties and interpreting behaviors. While analyzing the decision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing attention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally infeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose Decision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision boundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different sampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of decision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent to the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision regions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an approximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which only requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's decision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper bounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be trade-off with sampling times. Our results are empirically validated by extensive experiments across various LLMs and corpora.

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, spatiotemporal dynamical system, PDE, stabilization mechanisms, deep neural networks

Summary:
In this paper, a new analytical framework is introduced to understand the Transformer architecture as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The core components of the Transformer are reimagined as distinct mathematical operators within this framework. It is found that self-attention functions as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and residual connections and layer normalization as critical stabilization mechanisms. By conducting experiments comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator lacking stabilizers, it is shown that residual connections prevent catastrophic representational drift, while layer normalization stabilizes training dynamics. These findings highlight the mathematical necessity of these components in taming the inherent instability of the continuous system underlying the Transformer architecture. This work offers a foundational explanation for the design of the Transformer and presents a new approach for analyzing deep neural networks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks through the lens of continuous dynamics.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), while foundational to deep learning, imposes two critical scalability bottlenecks: update locking, where network modules remain idle until the entire backward pass completes, and high memory consumption due to storing activations for gradient computation. To address these limitations, we introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training framework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative refinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of modules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief about the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target with consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the backward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence eliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements. Meanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass, making SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical foundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with network depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the classification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced robustness to label noise.Code is available at: https://github.com/ychAlbert/sid-bp

Summary: 

Quant-dLLM is a new framework designed for ultra-low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) of diffusion large language models (dLLMs). It addresses the challenges in directly transferring PTQ to dLLMs at 2-bit precision, which typically results in subpar performance. The framework includes Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the masked denoising activations of dLLMs, improving reliability. It also introduces Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) for learning ultra-low-bit weight representations through iterative optimization guided by simulated calibration data. Additionally, Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP) is proposed for adaptive bit width allocation across channel groups under a strict 2-bit budget. Quant-dLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AR-transfer PTQ methods on dLLMs when restricted to 2-bit precision. The code and models for Quant-dLLM will be available on GitHub. <br> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which offer bidirectional context and flexible masked-denoising generation, are emerging as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs. However, like AR LLMs, their model sizes continue to grow, motivating weight compression for deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width across channel groups. When restricted to 2-bit precision, Quant-dLLM consistently achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) AR-transfer PTQ methods on dLLMs. The code and models will be available at: https://github.com/ZTA2785/Quant-dLLM.

Summary:<br>
Large language models (LLMs) require efficient deployment due to computational challenges, leading to the development of the Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs (SDQ-LLM). This framework allows for extremely low-bit quantization while maintaining linguistic reasoning capabilities by utilizing adjustable Over-Sampling Ratios (OSR) for optimal trade-offs between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM incorporates upsampling and Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLM weights, improving inference efficiency under low-bit quantization. Weight smoothing and a MultiOSR allocation strategy further enhance precision and reduce quantization sensitivity. Experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate high-precision performance under aggressive low-OSR settings. The code for SDQ-LLM is available for access on GitHub at https://github.com/Dreamlittlecat/LLM-Quant-Factory.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities. A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy, MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive low-OSR settings.

Abstract: The combination of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions forms the foundation of most modern deep neural networks, enabling them to approximate highly complex functions. This paper explores the introduction of quadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks, with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce parameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight quadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification techniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces quadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding negligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across three tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning large-language models. In all tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates clear and substantial performance gains.

Summary:<br>
A new study introduces Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) to solve differential equations under uncertainty, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of uncertainty and overconfidence in physical constraints. The study presents a scalable Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian to quantify the influence of individual physical constraints on the network's loss landscape. By applying the framework to the Van der Pol equation, researchers track how constraints shape the network's geometry and reveal the redistribution of curvature and dominance with changes in loss weights. This analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between physical constraints and network behavior, shedding light on the mechanisms behind overconfidence in B-PINNs and offering a new approach to understanding their performance. <br><br> <div>
arXiv:2510.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) merge data with governing equations to solve differential equations under uncertainty. However, interpreting uncertainty and overconfidence in B-PINNs requires care due to the poorly understood effects the physical constraints have on the network; overconfidence could reflect warranted precision, enforced by the constraints, rather than miscalibration. Motivated by the need to further clarify how individual physical constraints shape these networks, we introduce a scalable, matrix-free Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian into contributions from each constraint and provides metrics to quantify their relative influence on the loss landscape. Applied to the Van der Pol equation, our method tracks how constraints sculpt the network's geometry and shows, directly through the Hessian, how changing a single loss weight non-trivially redistributes curvature and effective dominance across the others.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in long-sequence modeling due to the trade-offs between efficiency and memory. Existing methods such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers have limitations in scaling and capturing long-range dependencies. The selective state-space model Mamba has shown high efficiency but suffers from exponential memory decay. The study delves into the memory decay mechanism of Mamba through mathematical derivations and information-theoretic analysis. By introducing horizontal-vertical memory fidelity metrics, the research quantifies information loss within and across layers. Inspired by human information retention mechanisms, the MemMamba framework is proposed, integrating state summarization and cross-layer and cross-token attention mechanisms to address long-range forgetting while maintaining linear complexity. Empirical results show significant improvements over existing models on long-sequence benchmarks, with a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. MemMamba offers a breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, paving the way for ultra-long sequence modeling. <br> <br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become increasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and bioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between efficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing and explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global dependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective state-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n) time and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays exponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and information-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay mechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of Mamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key information loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity metrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how humans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we propose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state summarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention, which alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity. MemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and Transformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval, while delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for ultra-long sequence modeling.

Summary:
Interpreting language models involves circuit analysis to identify specific subnetworks. Current algorithms face a trade-off between speed and faithfulness, with attribution patching being fast but unfaithful, and edge pruning faithful but computationally expensive. A new Hybrid Attribution and Pruning (HAP) framework combines attribution patching and edge pruning to efficiently identify high-potential subgraphs and extract faithful circuits. HAP is 46% faster than baseline methods while maintaining circuit faithfulness. A case study on the Indirect Object Identification task demonstrates that HAP preserves important circuit components that other methods may overlook at high sparsity levels. This research shows that HAP could enhance the scalability of interpretability research for larger models. The code for HAP is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Interpreting language models often involves circuit analysis, which aims to identify sparse subnetworks, or circuits, that accomplish specific tasks. Existing circuit discovery algorithms face a fundamental trade-off: attribution patching is fast but unfaithful to the full model, while edge pruning is faithful but computationally expensive. This research proposes a hybrid attribution and pruning (HAP) framework that uses attribution patching to identify a high-potential subgraph, then applies edge pruning to extract a faithful circuit from it. We show that HAP is 46\% faster than baseline algorithms without sacrificing circuit faithfulness. Furthermore, we present a case study on the Indirect Object Identification task, showing that our method preserves cooperative circuit components (e.g. S-inhibition heads) that attribution patching methods prune at high sparsity. Our results show that HAP could be an effective approach for improving the scalability of mechanistic interpretability research to larger models.

Summary:
MACE, a hybrid LLM system, addresses the tension between inference latency and model accuracy on edge servers by incorporating iteration-level scheduling. By balancing update frequency with service-level objectives, MACE maximizes task performance while ensuring inference throughput. The system collocates inference and fine-tuning processes, intelligently managing memory to optimize GPU resource allocation. Trace-driven evaluation demonstrates MACE's superiority over continuous and periodic retraining strategies, reducing latency by up to 63% while maintaining throughput and GPU utilization above 85%. The approach improves latency breakdown across prefill, decode, and finetune stages, highlighting the benefits of iteration-level hybrid scheduling for deploying LLMs with continual learning capabilities on edge platforms. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed on edge servers are increasingly used in latency-sensitive applications such as personalized assistants, recommendation, and content moderation. However, the non-stationary nature of user data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental tension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU resources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates, over-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining granularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is crucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating service-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that colocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with intelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising inference throughput. MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates equally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance throughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference latency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints. Compared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across prefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in NVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid scheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning capabilities on edge platforms.

Abstract: This paper proposes Edge-FIT (Federated Instruction Tuning on the Edge), a scalable framework for Federated Instruction Tuning (FIT) of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional Federated Learning (TFL) methods, like FedAvg, fail when confronted with the massive parameter size of LLMs [3], [6]. Our Edge-FIT framework combines federated learning with 4-bit Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA), mitigating the core issues of communication and computational overhead. We demonstrate this by filtering the general-purpose Databricks Dolly 15k dataset for the IoT domain. Experimental results show the Edge-FIT tuned Llama 2(7B) achieves an F1-Score of 0.89. We also demonstrate a viable trade-off using the 3.8B Phi-3-mini model, validating Edge-FIT as a scalable framework for decentralized LLM deployment on home compute gateways.

Summary: 
Log-based anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring software system reliability and performance. Existing methods heavily rely on manual labeling, which is challenging due to the large volume of logs. To address this issue, LogAction introduces a novel approach based on active domain adaptation. By combining transfer learning and active learning techniques, LogAction leverages labeled data from a mature system to train a base model and selects logs strategically for manual labeling using energy-based and uncertainty-based sampling. This approach mitigates the cold-start problem and addresses data distribution gaps with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on various datasets show that LogAction achieves a high F1 score of 93.01% with only 2% manual labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

Abstract: The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR) models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years, open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are based on a variant known as absorbing diffusion. However, this paper demonstrates why mask diffusion faces inherent difficulties in achieving parallel generation and bidirectional attention. We also propose the most effective training and inference strategies for mask diffusion.

Abstract: Within the growing interest in the physical sciences in developing networks with equivariance properties, Clifford neural layers shine as one approach that delivers $E(n)$ and $O(n)$ equivariances given specific group actions. In this paper, we analyze the inner structure of the computation within Clifford convolutional layers and propose and implement several optimizations to speed up the inference process while maintaining correctness. In particular, we begin by analyzing the theoretical foundations of Clifford algebras to eliminate redundant matrix allocations and computations, then systematically apply established optimization techniques to enhance performance further. We report a final average speedup of 21.35x over the baseline implementation of eleven functions and runtimes comparable to and faster than the original PyTorch implementation in six cases. In the remaining cases, we achieve performance in the same order of magnitude as the original library.

Summary: 
UniPruning introduces a unified post-training pruning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address computational and memory costs. It combines the speed of local saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination using mirror descent optimization without updating model weights. The framework supports both unstructured and semi-structured pruning, allowing for efficient allocation of a single sparsity budget. It can generate pruning masks for various sparsity levels and adapt to hardware constraints seamlessly. Experimental results on pretrained LLMs demonstrate competitive perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of UniPruning. Ablation studies emphasize the significance of mirror descent and local saliency anchoring in achieving optimal performance. UniPruning provides a scalable and principled solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs.

arXiv:2510.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but face prohibitive computational and memory costs. Pruning offers a promising path by inducing sparsity while preserving architectural flexibility. However, existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and robustness: local metric approaches prune layer by layer but often collapse under high sparsity, whereas global feedback methods enforce consistency at the cost of expensive weight updates or restrictive semi-structured formats. We present UniPruning, a unified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror descent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning leverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to allocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and semi-structured N :M pruning within one framework. After a brief calibration, it can generate pruning masks for arbitrary sparsity levels in one shot, and adapts seamlessly to hardware-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple pretrained LLM families and standard benchmarks show that UniPruning consistently delivers competitive or superior perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of mirror descent and local saliency anchoring. Overall, UniPruning provides an efficient, principled, and scalable solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/RainbowQTT/UniPruning.

Summary: <br>
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity via conditional routing, but face challenges in balancing load during inference due to expert overload. LASER is a plug-and-play algorithm that addresses this issue by adapting to the gate's score distribution. It routes tokens based on gate scores, optimizing load balance without the need for retraining. Evaluation on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat datasets shows that LASER improves load balancing, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput while maintaining accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity by routing each token to a subset of experts through a learned gate function. While conditional routing reduces training costs, it shifts the burden on inference memory: expert parameters and activations consume memory, limiting the number of experts per device. As tokens are routed, some experts become overloaded while others are underutilized. Because experts are mapped to GPUs, this imbalance translates directly into degraded system performance in terms of latency, throughput, and cost. We present LASER, a plug-and-play, inference-time routing algorithm that balances load while preserving accuracy. LASER adapts to the shape of the gate's score distribution. When scores provide a clear preference, it routes to the strongest experts; when scores are more uniform, it broadens the set of viable experts and routes to the least-loaded among them. Because LASER relies only on gate scores from a trained model, it integrates directly into existing MoE inference pipelines without retraining or finetuning. We evaluate LASER on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat across four datasets (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and GSM8K). LASER improves load balancing, translating into lower latency and higher throughput, while keeping the accuracy changes negligible.

Summary: Concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models are vital for safety and copyright concerns. However, as models progress to next-gen architectures like Flux, traditional erasure methods are less effective. Research shows that erasure methods only create the illusion of forgetting, biasing sampling trajectories away from target concepts. A new framework, Revoking Amnesia (RevAm), utilizes RL-based trajectory optimization to dynamically steer the denoising process without altering model weights. By adapting GRPO to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, achieving superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time. This highlights shortcomings in current safety mechanisms and the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.<br><br> <div>

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.

Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly applied in climate modeling on system emulation acceleration, data-driven parameter inference, forecasting, and knowledge discovery, addressing challenges such as physical consistency, multi-scale coupling, data sparsity, robust generalization, and integration with scientific workflows. This paper analyzes a series of case studies from applied machine learning research in climate modeling, with a focus on design choices and workflow structure. Rather than reviewing technical details, we aim to synthesize workflow design patterns across diverse projects in ML-enabled climate modeling: from surrogate modeling, ML parameterization, probabilistic programming, to simulation-based inference, and physics-informed transfer learning. We unpack how these workflows are grounded in physical knowledge, informed by simulation data, and designed to integrate observations. We aim to offer a framework for ensuring rigor in scientific machine learning through more transparent model development, critical evaluation, informed adaptation, and reproducibility, and to contribute to lowering the barrier for interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of data science and climate modeling.

Summary:
The study explores the use of thin contrastive bridges as a lightweight alternative to pretraining heavy multimodal models for drug discovery and biomedical applications. By aligning molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections, the researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in aligning chemical and textual representations. Incorporating hard negative weighting and margin loss, the method improves within target discrimination and enhances cross-modal alignment across disjoint chemical cores, particularly beneficial for drugs targeting the same therapeutic target.

arXiv:2510.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models hold promise for drug discovery and biomedical applications, but most existing approaches rely on heavy pretraining or large scale multimodal corpora. We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges, lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.

Summary: LLMs are being used to simulate human behavior in business and social science, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in replicating human behavior in operations management. The research finds that while LLMs can reproduce most hypothesis-level effects and capture key decision biases, there are divergences in response distributions compared to human data. The study also tests two interventions, chain-of-thought prompting and hyperparameter tuning, which help reduce misalignment and enable smaller or open-source models to match or surpass larger systems in some cases. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in modeling human behavior in operations management and the importance of considering interventions to improve model performance.<br> <div>

Abstract: LLMs are emerging tools for simulating human behavior in business, economics, and social science, offering a lower-cost complement to laboratory experiments, field studies, and surveys. This paper evaluates how well LLMs replicate human behavior in operations management. Using nine published experiments in behavioral operations, we assess two criteria: replication of hypothesis-test outcomes and distributional alignment via Wasserstein distance. LLMs reproduce most hypothesis-level effects, capturing key decision biases, but their response distributions diverge from human data, including for strong commercial models. We also test two lightweight interventions -- chain-of-thought prompting and hyperparameter tuning -- which reduce misalignment and can sometimes let smaller or open-source models match or surpass larger systems.

Summary: 
The study introduces a quality-aware scaling law in language model training that considers data quality as a key factor alongside model size and dataset volume. The law incorporates a dimensionless data-quality parameter, Q, and extends the Chinchilla framework to predict loss through a joint function of model size, data volume, and data quality. By conducting synthetic experiments in neural machine translation and autoregressive modeling with controlled data quality variations, the study demonstrates that loss scales predictably with data quality. Higher-quality data can lead to reduced model size and compute requirements, with a sublinear decay of effective data with quality. The study also provides estimators for measuring data quality, such as a corruption rate proxy and a deficiency measure. This work establishes a clear and generalizable law for data quality, offering insights into optimizing data curation effort and model scale in large-scale pretraining.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws for language model training traditionally characterize how performance scales with model size and dataset volume. Prior work has explored architecture variants and data treatments such as dataset filtering and noise injection in language model pretraining; however, these studies have not formalized data quality within a principled scaling law. We introduce a dimensionless data-quality parameter Q, and propose a quality-aware scaling law extending the Chinchilla framework to predict loss as a joint function of model size, data volume, and data quality. The law is motivated by an effective-sample-size and information-theoretic view of noisy or redundant corpora, and it admits two practical estimators for Q: (i) a corruption rate proxy and (ii) a deficiency measure. Through synthetic experiments in neural machine translation and autoregressive modeling -- where we systematically control data quality via multiple levels of noise injection and coverage variation -- we show that loss scales predictably with data quality and that higher-quality data can substantially reduce model size and hence compute requirements. Our results demonstrate a sublinear decay of effective data with quality and robustness to moderate data corruption; out-of-sample evaluations further validate the predictive form of the law. Unlike prior empirical analyses, our work establishes an explicit, generalizable law for data quality, offering concrete guidance for balancing data curation effort and model scale in large-scale pretraining.

arXiv:2510.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of a frequency with minimal delay from a sinusoidal signal is a common task in several fields; for example Ring Laser Gyroscopes, since their output signal is a beat frequency. While conventional methods require several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10 milliseconds. This enables rapid trigger generation. The method outperforms standard Fourier-based techniques, improving frequency estimation precision by a factor of 2 in the operational range of GINGERINO, our Ring Laser Gyroscope.\\ In addition to fast frequency estimation, we introduce an automated classification framework to identify physical disturbances in the signal, such as laser instabilities and seismic events, achieving accuracy rates between 99\% and 100\% on independent test datasets for the seismic class.

Abstract: The training process of reinforcement learning often suffers from severe oscillations, leading to instability and degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a Constant in an Ever-Changing World (CIC) framework that enhances algorithmic stability to improve performance. CIC maintains both a representative policy and a current policy. Instead of updating the representative policy blindly, CIC selectively updates it only when the current policy demonstrates superiority. Furthermore, CIC employs an adaptive adjustment mechanism, enabling the representative and current policies to jointly facilitate critic training. We evaluate CIC on five MuJoCo environments, and the results show that CIC improves the performance of conventional algorithms without incurring additional computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) schedulers are pivotal in optimizing resource allocation in GPU clusters, but operate with a critical limitation: they are largely blind to the semantic context of the jobs they manage. This forces them to rely on limited metadata, leading to high profiling overhead, unreliable duration estimation, inadequate failure handling, and poor observability. To this end, we propose SchedMate, a framework that bridges this semantic gap by systematically extracting deep insights from overlooked, unstructured data sources: source code, runtime logs, and historical jobs. SchedMate enhances existing schedulers non-intrusively through three LLM-based components. Our implementation integrates seamlessly with existing deep learning schedulers. Evaluations on a 128-GPU physical cluster and extensive simulations on production traces show SchedMate reduces average job completion times by up to 1.91x, substantially enhancing the scheduling performance, demonstrating the critical role of semantic-awareness in modern DL scheduling.

<title>Matching the Optimal Denoiser in Point Cloud Diffusion with (Improved) Rotational Alignment</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models are a popular class of generative models trained to reverse a noising process starting from a target data distribution. Training a diffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different noise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules and proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To capture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by transforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then, the denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the effect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the optimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over $SO(3)$. Alignment corresponds to sampling the mode of this distribution, and turns out to be the zeroth order approximation for small noise levels, explaining its effectiveness. We build on this perspective to derive better approximators to the optimal denoiser in the limit of small noise. Our experiments highlight that alignment is often a `good enough' approximation for the noise levels that matter most for training diffusion models.

<title>Pool Me Wisely: On the Effect of Pooling in Transformer-Based Models</title>

Abstract: Transformer models have become the dominant backbone for sequence modeling, leveraging self-attention to produce contextualized token representations. These are typically aggregated into fixed-size vectors via pooling operations for downstream tasks. While much of the literature has focused on attention mechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical impact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework that rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models equipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on their representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs. Our analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations, demonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We empirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and local contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal consistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and optimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical perspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling mechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key architectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more principled model design beyond attention alone.

<title>Learning Pareto-Optimal Pandemic Intervention Policies with MORL</title>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator, calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health crises.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the aviation industry, there is a need for a large number of flight crew. How to select the right pilots in a cost-efficient manner has become an important research question. In the current study, twenty-three pilots were recruited from China Eastern Airlines, and 23 novices were from the community of Tsinghua University. A novel approach incorporating machine learning and virtual reality technology was applied to distinguish features between these participants with different flight skills. Results indicate that SVM with the MIC feature selection method consistently achieved the highest prediction performance on all metrics with an Accuracy of 0.93, an AUC of 0.96, and an F1 of 0.93, which outperforms four other classifier algorithms and two other feature selection methods. From the perspective of feature selection methods, the MIC method can select features with a nonlinear relationship to sampling labels, instead of a simple filter-out. Our new implementation of the SVM + MIC algorithm outperforms all existing pilot selection algorithms and perhaps provides the first implementation based on eye tracking and flight dynamics data. This study's VR simulation platforms and algorithms can be used for pilot selection and training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

arXiv:2510.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex, high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging, long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of 3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of 12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning tasks in critical domains.

Abstract: Nearly one in five adolescents currently live with a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition, such as anxiety, depression, or conduct disorder, underscoring the urgency of developing accurate and interpretable diagnostic tools. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.

Abstract: Transformers are widely used across data modalities, and yet the principles distilled from text models often transfer imperfectly to models trained to other modalities. In this paper, we analyze Transformers through the lens of rank structure. Our focus is on the time series setting, where the structural properties of the data differ remarkably from those of text or vision. We show that time-series embeddings, unlike text or vision, exhibit sharply decaying singular value spectra: small patch sizes and smooth continuous mappings concentrate the data into low-rank subspaces. From this, we prove that the associated $Q/K/V$ projections admit accurate low-rank approximations, and that attention layers become compressible in proportion to the decay of the embedding spectrum. We introduce the concept of flow-of-ranks, a phenomenon by which nonlinear mixing across depth inflates the rank, explaining why early layers are most amenable to compression and why ranks grow with depth. Guided by these theoretical and empirical results, we use these insights to compress Chronos, a large time series foundation model, achieving a reduction of $65\%$ in inference time and $81\%$ in memory, without loss of accuracy. Our findings provide principled guidance for allocating width, depth, and heads in time series foundation models, and for exploiting their inherent compressibility.

Abstract: Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.

Abstract: Open-source data offers a scalable and transparent foundation for estimating vehicle activity and emissions in urban regions. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area. The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using fully open data sources.

Abstract: High-quality observations of hub-height winds are valuable but sparse in space and time. Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines, WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to independent observations.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead to selective impairments: disabling identified "recall circuits" reduces fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas disabling "reasoning circuits" reduces multi-step inference by a comparable margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing safer deployment of large language models.

Abstract: The training of large models demands substantial computational resources, typically available only in data centers with high-bandwidth interconnects. However, reducing the reliance on high-bandwidth interconnects between nodes enables the use of distributed compute resources as an alternative to centralized data center training. Building on recent advances in distributed model training, we propose an approach that further reduces communication by combining infrequent synchronizations across distributed model replicas with gradient momentum compression. In particular, we treat the optimizer momentum as a signal and decompose the Nesterov momentum into high- and low-frequency components via the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Only the high-frequency components are synchronized across model replicas every $H$ steps. Empirically, our method achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction in communication compared to the baseline DiLoCo, and it generalizes across architectures, including transformer-based language models and convolutional neural networks for images. Overall, this work advances the feasibility of training large models on distributed nodes with low-bandwidth interconnects.

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by CPSC-DFKD. The code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CPSC-DFKD.git

<title>A Robust Clustered Federated Learning Approach for Non-IID Data with Quantity Skew</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized paradigm that enables a client-server architecture to collaboratively train a global Artificial Intelligence model without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. A key challenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of Non-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising solution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping clients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally fall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the cluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the server groups clients based on local model similarities. However, most CFL methods lack systematic evaluation under QS but present significant challenges because of it.  In this paper, we present two main contributions. The first one is an evaluation of state-of-the-art CFL algorithms under various Non-IID settings, applying multiple QS scenarios to assess their robustness. Our second contribution is a novel iterative CFL algorithm, named CORNFLQS, which proposes an optimal coordination between both operating strategies of CFL. Our approach is robust against the different variations of QS settings. We conducted intensive experiments on six image classification datasets, resulting in 270 Non-IID configurations. The results show that CORNFLQS achieves the highest average ranking in both accuracy and clustering quality, as well as strong robustness to QS perturbations. Overall, our approach outperforms actual CFL algorithms.

Abstract: Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction. To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data, forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy. Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training large language models (LLMs) with stronger reasoning abilities. It has also been applied to a variety of logic puzzles. In this work, we study the Korean word-chain game using RLVR. We show that rule-derived rewards can naturally conflict, and demonstrate through experiments that a curriculum-learning scheme mitigates these conflicts. Our findings motivate further studies of puzzle tasks in diverse languages.

Abstract: A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware wind power prediction is essential for grid integration and reliable wind farm operation. We apply neural diffusion processes (NDPs)-a recent class of models that learn distributions over functions-and extend them to a multi-task NDP (MT-NDP) framework for wind power prediction. We provide the first empirical evaluation of NDPs in real supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. We introduce a task encoder within MT-NDPs to capture cross-turbine correlations and enable few-shot adaptation to unseen turbines. The proposed MT-NDP framework outperforms single-task NDPs and GPs in terms of point accuracy and calibration, particularly for wind turbines whose behaviour deviates from the fleet average. In general, NDP-based models deliver calibrated and scalable predictions suitable for operational deployment, offering sharper, yet trustworthy, predictive intervals that can support dispatch and maintenance decisions in modern wind farms.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with backpropagation\textemdash even for a subset of parameters such as LoRA\textemdash can be much more memory-consuming than inference and is often deemed impractical for resource-constrained mobile devices. Alternative methods, such as zeroth-order optimization (ZO), can greatly reduce the memory footprint but come at the cost of significantly slower model convergence (10$\times$ to 100$\times$ more steps than backpropagation). We propose a memory-efficient implementation of backpropagation (MeBP) on mobile devices that provides better trade-off between memory usage and compute time, while converging faster and achieving better performance than the ZO baseline. We verify the effectiveness of MeBP on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and show that various LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 4B parameters, can be fine-tuned using less than 1GB of memory. We release an example of the MeBP implementation at https://github.com/apple/ml-mebp.

Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.

<title>LHGEL: Large Heterogeneous Graph Ensemble Learning using Batch View Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03432</link>

arXiv:2510.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from large heterogeneous graphs presents significant challenges due to the scale of networks, heterogeneity in node and edge types, variations in nodal features, and complex local neighborhood structures. This paper advocates for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation, residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning. Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Chrisshen12/LHGEL.

Abstract: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Humans are black boxes -- we cannot observe their neural processes, yet society functions by evaluating verifiable arguments. AI explainability should follow this principle: stakeholders need verifiable reasoning chains, not mechanistic transparency. We propose using structured argumentation to provide a level of explanation and verification neither interpretability nor LLM-generated explanation is able to offer. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7 points above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\sim$0.07 above previous published results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts relation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling verification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent risk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized agents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise achieved by humans alone. Using Bipolar Assumption-Based Argumentation, we capture support/attack relationships, thereby enabling automatic hallucination detection via fact nodes attacking arguments. We also provide a verification mechanism that enables iterative refinement through test-time feedback without retraining. For easy deployment, we provide a Docker container for the fine-tuned AMT model, and the rest of the code with the Bipolar ABA Python package on GitHub.

<title>On residual network depth</title>

arXiv:2510.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep residual architectures, such as ResNet and the Transformer, have enabled models of unprecedented depth, yet a formal understanding of why depth is so effective remains an open question. A popular intuition, following Veit et al. (2016), is that these residual networks behave like ensembles of many shallower models. Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this ensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically equivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our expansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial growth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal, explaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep models. This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical dependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of successful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup. However, while these previous approaches infer scaling factors through optimizer analysis or a heuristic analogy to Batch Normalization, our work offers the first explanation derived directly from the network's inherent functional structure. Specifically, our Residual Expansion Theorem reveals that scaling each residual module provides a principled solution to taming the combinatorial explosion inherent to these architectures. We further show that this scaling acts as a capacity controls that also implicitly regularizes the model's complexity.

<title>How to Set $\beta_1, \beta_2$ in Adam: An Online Learning Perspective</title>

Abstract: While Adam is one of the most effective optimizer for training large-scale machine learning models, a theoretical understanding of how to optimally set its momentum factors, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, remains largely incomplete.
  Prior works have shown that Adam can be seen as an instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), one of the most important class of algorithms in online learning.
  The prior analyses in these works required setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$, which does not cover the more practical cases with $\beta_1 \neq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  We derive novel, more general analyses that hold for both $\beta_1 \geq \sqrt{\beta_2}$ and $\beta_1 \leq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  In both cases, our results strictly generalize the existing bounds.
  Furthermore, we show that our bounds are tight in the worst case.
  We also prove that setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$ is optimal for an oblivious adversary, but sub-optimal for an non-oblivious adversary.

<title>Reasoning-based Anomaly Detection Framework: A Real-time, Scalable, and Automated Approach to Anomaly Detection Across Domains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.

<title>Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Policy Evaluation in Finite-Horizon Offline RL with Linear $q^\pi$-Realizability and Concentrability</title>

arXiv:2510.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation for both policy evaluation and policy optimization. Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.

arXiv:2510.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and meta-learning methods typically struggle to generalize across diverse domains, as most approaches focus on a single dataset, failing to transfer knowledge across various seen and unseen domains. Existing solutions often suffer from low accuracy, high computational costs, and rely on restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of task-level contrastiveness, a novel approach designed to address issues of existing methods. We start by introducing simple ways to define task augmentations, and thereafter define a task-level contrastive loss that encourages unsupervised clustering of task representations. Our method is lightweight and can be easily integrated within existing few-shot/meta-learning algorithms while providing significant benefits. Crucially, it leads to improved generalization and computational efficiency without requiring prior knowledge of task domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through different experiments on the MetaDataset benchmark, where it achieves superior performance without additional complexity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded opportunities for innovation but also increased exposure to botnet-driven cyberattacks. Conventional detection methods often struggle with scalability, privacy, and adaptability in resource-constrained IoT environments. To address these challenges, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving botnet detection framework based on federated learning. This approach enables distributed devices to collaboratively train models without exchanging raw data, thus maintaining user privacy while preserving detection accuracy. A communication-efficient aggregation strategy is introduced to reduce overhead, ensuring suitability for constrained IoT networks. Experiments on benchmark IoT botnet datasets demonstrate that the framework achieves high detection accuracy while substantially reducing communication costs. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical path toward scalable, secure, and privacy-aware intrusion detection for IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy for finetuning small language models (SLMs) to solve targeted tasks such as math and coding. However, RL algorithms tend to be resource-intensive, taking a significant amount of time to train. We propose RAPID, a novel RL algorithm that can substantially reduce the running time of RL. Our key insight is that RL tends to be costly due to the need to perform both inference and backpropagation during training. To maximize use of computational resources, our algorithm performs inference in large batches, and then performs off-policy policy gradient updates in mini-batches. For off-policy updates, we incorporate group advantage estimation into the policy gradient algorithm, and derive an importance weighted estimator to correct for the bias arising from off-policy learning. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce running time by 11%-34% on three benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art RL algorithms while maintaining similar or better accuracy.

<title>Certifiable Safe RLHF: Fixed-Penalty Constraint Optimization for Safer Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03520</link>

arXiv:2510.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models (LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts

Abstract: Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.

Abstract: A variety of models have been developed to forecast dengue cases to date. However, it remains a challenge to predict major dengue outbreaks that need timely public warnings the most. In this paper, we introduce CrossLag, an environmentally informed attention that allows for the incorporation of lagging endogenous signals behind the significant events in the exogenous data into the architecture of the transformer at low parameter counts. Outbreaks typically lag behind major changes in climate and oceanic anomalies. We use TimeXer, a recent general-purpose transformer distinguishing exogenous-endogenous inputs, as the baseline for this study. Our proposed model outperforms TimeXer by a considerable margin in detecting and predicting major outbreaks in Singapore dengue data over a 24-week prediction window.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

<title>Generalization of Graph Neural Network Models for Distribution Grid Fault Detection</title>

Abstract: Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.

<title>Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Small Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.

<title>BEKAN: Boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with radial basis functions for solving PDE problems</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has gained attention for solving PDEs, but the black-box nature of neural networks hinders precise enforcement of boundary conditions. To address this, we propose a boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with radial basis functions (BEKAN). In BEKAN, we propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating Dirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For Dirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct univariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode boundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic problems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal functions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we devise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward satisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the periodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE simulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions. For demonstration, we conducted extensive numerical experiments on Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and mixed boundary value problems. The results indicate that BEKAN outperforms both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and B-splines KAN in terms of accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed approach enhances the capability of KANs in solving PDE problems while satisfying boundary conditions, thereby facilitating advancements in scientific computing and engineering applications.

<title>Latent Mixture of Symmetries for Sample-Efficient Dynamic Learning</title>

Abstract: Learning dynamics is essential for model-based control and Reinforcement Learning in engineering systems, such as robotics and power systems. However, limited system measurements, such as those from low-resolution sensors, demand sample-efficient learning. Symmetry provides a powerful inductive bias by characterizing equivariant relations in system states to improve sample efficiency. While recent methods attempt to discover symmetries from data, they typically assume a single global symmetry group and treat symmetry discovery and dynamic learning as separate tasks, leading to limited expressiveness and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose the Latent Mixture of Symmetries (Latent MoS), an expressive model that captures a mixture of symmetry-governed latent factors from complex dynamical measurements. Latent MoS focuses on dynamic learning while locally and provably preserving the underlying symmetric transformations. To further capture long-term equivariance, we introduce a hierarchical architecture that stacks MoS blocks. Numerical experiments in diverse physical systems demonstrate that Latent MoS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in interpolation and extrapolation tasks while offering interpretable latent representations suitable for future geometric and safety-critical analyses.

<title>FieldFormer: Physics-Informed Transformers for Spatio-Temporal Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensors</title>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.

Abstract: We address the challenge of coordinating multiple robots in narrow and confined environments, where congestion and interference often hinder collective task performance. Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which achieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting environmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local and social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without explicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations of existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum learning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder sub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most effective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into asymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group performance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in nature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent coordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.

<title>MECKD: Deep Learning-Based Fall Detection in Multilayer Mobile Edge Computing With Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: The rising aging population has increased the importance of fall detection (FD) systems as an assistive technology, where deep learning techniques are widely applied to enhance accuracy. FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs) worn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud center (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges such as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between EDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a multilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC splits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If front-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a station with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD) approach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing high-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences, enhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation results demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the SisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also reduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on the SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD system exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines plays a vital role in predictive maintenance, ensuring operational safety and efficiency in aviation. Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation (DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data, and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced, organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied), alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL prediction for turbofan engines.

Abstract: This paper introduces Hill-ADAM. Hill-ADAM is an optimizer with its focus towards escaping local minima in prescribed loss landscapes to find the global minimum. Hill-ADAM escapes minima by deterministically exploring the state space. This eliminates uncertainty from random gradient updates in stochastic algorithms while seldom converging at the first minimum that visits. In the paper we first derive an analytical approximation of the ADAM Optimizer step size at a particular model state. From there define the primary condition determining ADAM limitations in escaping local minima. The proposed optimizer algorithm Hill-ADAM alternates between error minimization and maximization. It maximizes to escape the local minimum and minimizes again afterward. This alternation provides an overall exploration throughout the loss space. This allows the deduction of the global minimum's state. Hill-ADAM was tested with 5 loss functions and 12 amber-saturated to cooler-shade image color correction instances.

Abstract: We present Neural Bayesian Filtering (NBF), an algorithm for maintaining distributions over hidden states, called beliefs, in partially observable systems. NBF is trained to find a good latent representation of the beliefs induced by a task. It maps beliefs to fixed-length embedding vectors, which condition generative models for sampling. During filtering, particle-style updates compute posteriors in this embedding space using incoming observations and the environment's dynamics. NBF combines the computational efficiency of classical filters with the expressiveness of deep generative models - tracking rapidly shifting, multimodal beliefs while mitigating the risk of particle impoverishment. We validate NBF in state estimation tasks in three partially observable environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term stock price movement remains a challenging task due to the market's inherent volatility and sensitivity to investor sentiment. This paper discusses a deep learning framework that integrates emotion features extracted from tweet data with historical stock price information to forecast significant price changes on the following day. We utilize Meta's Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model to preprocess tweet data, thereby enhancing the quality of emotion features derived from three emotion analysis approaches: a transformer-based DistilRoBERTa classifier from the Hugging Face library and two lexicon-based methods using National Research Council Canada (NRC) resources. These features are combined with previous-day stock price data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Experimental results on TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN stocks show that all three emotion analysis methods improve the average accuracy for predicting significant price movements, compared to the baseline model using only historical stock prices, which yields an accuracy of 13.5%. The DistilRoBERTa-based stock prediction model achieves the best performance, with accuracy rising from 23.6% to 38.5% when using LLaMA-enhanced emotion analysis. These results demonstrate that using large language models to preprocess tweet content enhances the effectiveness of emotion analysis which in turn improves the accuracy of predicting significant stock price movements.

Abstract: This study explored how in-context learning (ICL) in large language models can be disrupted by data poisoning attacks in the setting of public health sentiment analysis. Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small adversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and randomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these minor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in up to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied, which filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and sentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%, and logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the defense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings extend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes setting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and potential defenses for robust LLM deployment. This study also highlights the fragility of ICL under attack and the value of spectral defenses in making AI systems more reliable for health-related social media monitoring.

Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective treatment for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent research uses reinforcement learning (RL) for DBS, with RL agents modulating the stimulation frequency and amplitude. But, these models rely on biomarkers that are not measurable in patients and are only present in brain-on-chip (BoC) simulations. In this work, we present an RL-based DBS approach that adapts these stimulation parameters according to brain activity measurable in vivo. Using a TD3 based RL agent trained on a model of the basal ganglia region of the brain, we see a greater suppression of biomarkers correlated with PD severity compared to modern clinical DBS implementations. Our agent outperforms the standard clinical approaches in suppressing PD biomarkers while relying on information that can be measured in a real world environment, thereby opening up the possibility of training personalized RL agents specific to individual patient needs.

Abstract: Continuous learning of novel classes is crucial for edge devices to preserve data privacy and maintain reliable performance in dynamic environments. However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture, and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods, specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with practical implementation.

Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

<title>Optimising Battery Energy Storage System Trading via Energy Market Operator Price Forecast</title>

Abstract: In electricity markets around the world, the ability to anticipate price movements with precision can be the difference between profit and loss, especially for fast-acting assets like battery energy storage systems (BESS). As grid volatility increases due to renewables and market decentralisation, operators and forecasters alike face growing pressure to transform prediction into strategy. Yet while forecast data is abundant, especially in advanced markets like Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), its practical value in driving real-world BESS trading decisions remains largely unexplored. This thesis dives into that gap. This work addresses a key research question: Can the accuracy of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) energy price forecasts be systematically leveraged to develop a reliable and profitable battery energy storage system trading algorithm? Despite the availability of AEMO price forecasts, no existing framework evaluates their reliability or incorporates them into practical BESS trading strategies. By analysing patterns in forecast accuracy based on time of day, forecast horizon, and regional variations, this project creates a novel, forecast-informed BESS trading model to optimise arbitrage financial returns. The performance of this forecast-driven algorithm is benchmarked against a basic trading algorithm with no knowledge of forecast data. The study further explores the potential of machine learning techniques to predict future energy prices by enhancing AEMO forecasts to govern a more advanced trading strategy. The research outcomes will inform future improvements in energy market trading models and promote more efficient BESS integration into market operations.

<title>Does higher interpretability imply better utility? A Pairwise Analysis on Sparse Autoencoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03659</link>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models (LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility? To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B, Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels, and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench (arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298), indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52 percent compared to the current best output score based criterion (arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering features.

<title>Operationalizing Data Minimization for Privacy-Preserving LLM Prompting</title>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) in consumer applications has led to frequent exchanges of personal information. To obtain useful responses, users often share more than necessary, increasing privacy risks via memorization, context-based personalization, or security breaches. We present a framework to formally define and operationalize data minimization: for a given user prompt and response model, quantifying the least privacy-revealing disclosure that maintains utility, and we propose a priority-queue tree search to locate this optimal point within a privacy-ordered transformation space. We evaluated the framework on four datasets spanning open-ended conversations (ShareGPT, WildChat) and knowledge-intensive tasks with single-ground-truth answers (CaseHold, MedQA), quantifying achievable data minimization with nine LLMs as the response model. Our results demonstrate that larger frontier LLMs can tolerate stronger data minimization while maintaining task quality than smaller open-source models (85.7% redaction for GPT-5 vs. 19.3% for Qwen2.5-0.5B). By comparing with our search-derived benchmarks, we find that LLMs struggle to predict optimal data minimization directly, showing a bias toward abstraction that leads to oversharing. This suggests not just a privacy gap, but a capability gap: models may lack awareness of what information they actually need to solve a task.

<title>Token Hidden Reward: Steering Exploration-Exploitation in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03669</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: This paper studies the computational challenges of large-scale attention-based models in artificial intelligence by utilizing importance sampling methods in the streaming setting. Inspired by the classical definition of the $\ell_2$ sampler and the recent progress of the attention scheme in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose the definition of the attention sampler. Our approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional attention mechanisms. We analyze the effectiveness of the attention sampler from a theoretical perspective, including space and update time. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability and broad applicability across various model architectures and domains.

Abstract: We introduce Group Policy Gradient (GPG), a family of critic-free policy-gradient estimators for general MDPs. Inspired by the success of GRPO's approach in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), GPG replaces a learned value function with a group-based Monte Carlo advantage estimator, removing the memory, compute, and hyperparameter costs of training a critic while preserving PPO's clipped-objective structure. We prove the consistency of the GPG estimator, analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs, and demonstrate empirically that GPG matches or outperforms PPO on standard benchmarks. GPG makes better use of parallel simulations, which, together with its critic-free design, results in more efficient use of computational resources than PPO.

<title>From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.

<title>REG: A Regularization Optimizer for Robust Training Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Optimizers are crucial for the efficient training of Large Language Models (LLMs). While AdamW is the de facto standard, recent structure-aware optimizers like Muon have emerged, which regularize gradient updates by operating on entire weight matrices. The Muon optimizer balances the gradient updates along all the directions. However, Muon's reliance on the matrix sign function can lead to training instability, exhibits incompatibility when fine-tuning models pre-trained with AdamW. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REG}, a novel optimizer that replaces Muon's aggressive matrix sign operator with the Row-and-Column-Scaling (RACS) operator. Theoretically grounded in balancing a matrix, the RACS operator regularizes the update steps in a less drastic manner, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with established training dynamics. Through extensive empirical experiments on LLM training, we demonstrate that our REG optimizer not only achieves superior performance and stability over AdamW, but also maintains consistency with the AdamW training paradigm. This consistency is particularly evident during the fine-tuning stage, where REG optimizer avoids the performance degradation observed with Muon.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to sequential decision making, where interpretability and performance are both critical for practical adoption. Current approaches typically focus on performance and rely on post hoc explanations to account for interpretability. Different from these approaches, we focus on designing an interpretability-oriented yet performance-enhanced RL approach. Specifically, we propose a spectral based linear RL method that extends the ridge regression-based approach through a spectral filter function. The proposed method clarifies the role of regularization in controlling estimation error and further enables the design of an adaptive regularization parameter selection strategy guided by the bias-variance trade-off principle. Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal bounds for both parameter estimation and generalization error. Extensive experiments on simulated environments and real-world datasets from Kuaishou and Taobao demonstrate that our method either outperforms or matches existing baselines in decision quality. We also conduct interpretability analyses to illustrate how the learned policies make decisions, thereby enhancing user trust. These results highlight the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between RL theory and practical decision making, providing interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in management contexts.

Abstract: Federated learning has received significant attention for its ability to simultaneously protect customer privacy and leverage distributed data from multiple devices for model training. However, conventional approaches often focus on isolated heterogeneous scenarios, resulting in skewed feature distributions or label distributions. Meanwhile, data heterogeneity is actually a key factor in improving model performance. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called PFPL in mixed heterogeneous scenarios. The method provides richer domain knowledge and unbiased convergence targets by constructing personalized, unbiased prototypes for each client. Moreover, in the local update phase, we introduce consistent regularization to align local instances with their personalized prototypes, which significantly improves the convergence of the loss function. Experimental results on Digits and Office Caltech datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach and successfully reduce the communication cost.

Abstract: The rapid development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has noticeably improved the efficiency of adapting large language models. Among these, LoRA has gained widespread popularity due to its strong balance of effectiveness and parameter efficiency. However, LoRA relies on initializing two low-rank matrices whose product is zero, which limits its ability to effectively activate and leverage the original model weights-creating a potential bottleneck for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{IniLoRA}, a novel initialization strategy that initializes the low-rank matrices to closely approximate the original model weights. Experimental results indicate that IniLoRA achieves better performance than LoRA across a range of models and tasks. Additionally, we introduce two variants, IniLoRA-$\alpha$ and IniLoRA-$\beta$, both leveraging distinct initialization methods to enhance performance further.

<title>Cost Efficient Fairness Audit Under Partial Feedback</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of audit cost.

<title>HydroFusion-LMF: Semi-Supervised Multi-Network Fusion with Large-Model Adaptation for Long-Term Daily Runoff Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles, regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement, frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance, flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment, augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter / LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a ~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818, improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.

Abstract: Low-discrepancy points are designed to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in science and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. Whereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra and number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced to exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower discrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating point sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e., sequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property essential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based framework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train a neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences exhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes. To this end, we deploy a two-stage learning process: supervised approximation of classical constructions followed by unsupervised fine-tuning to minimize prefix discrepancies. We demonstrate that $NeuroLDS$ outperforms all previous LDS constructions by a significant margin with respect to discrepancy measures. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of $NeuroLDS$ across diverse applications, including numerical integration, robot motion planning, and scientific machine learning. These results highlight the promise and broad significance of Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences. Our code can be found at https://github.com/camail-official/neuro-lds.

Abstract: CUDA kernel optimization has become a critical bottleneck for AI performance, as deep learning training and inference efficiency directly depends on highly optimized GPU kernels.
  Despite the promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating kernel optimization, this field suffers from a fragmented ecosystem of isolated and incomparable approaches with unclear problem formulations.
  Furthermore, general-purpose LLM code evolution methods cannot meet strict correctness requirements of CUDA kernel optimization.
  We address these fundamental challenges by first formalizing CUDA kernel optimization as a code optimization task with a clear objective, constraints, and evaluation metrics.
  We then establish the first systematic LLM-based code evolution framework, EvoEngineer, that provides guidance for designing and adapting optimization strategies to achieve a balance between performance and correctness.
  Finally, we implement a kernel optimization system based on this framework and conduct extensive experiments on 91 real-world CUDA kernels.
  Our results demonstrate that EvoEngineer achieves a principled balance between performance and correctness, with the highest averaged median speedup of \textbf{2.72}$\times$ over baseline CUDA kernels and a code validity rate of \textbf{69.8}\%, outperforming existing methods on both dimensions.
  Our method achieves a maximum speedup of \textbf{36.75}$\times$ among all operations over PyTorch kernels and delivers the highest speedup on \textbf{28} (\textbf{56.0\%}) of 50 operations that achieve over \textbf{2$\times$} acceleration.

<title>Merge and Guide: Unifying Model Merging and Guided Decoding for Controllable Multi-Objective Generation</title>

Abstract: Adapting to diverse user needs at test time is a key challenge in controllable multi-objective generation. Existing methods are insufficient: merging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter level, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While decoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating logits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and relying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we introduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model merging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem between the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by dynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone models that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and implicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the decoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship between model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced controllability afforded by our approach. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior controllability, Pareto-optimal performance, and enhanced adaptability.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable successes across a wide range of applications, yet the theoretical foundation of their model efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how the model parameters -- mainly attention heads and head dimensions -- should be allocated across layers to balance expressivity and efficiency. We first provide mathematical analysis on the role of early layers in information extraction from an approximation perspective, with a theoretical characterization on the trade-off between the number of heads and head dimension under a fixed parameter budget. In addition, we uncover and prove the \emph{saturation} behavior of softmax activations: Continuously increasing head dimensions can lead to diminishing returns in learning errors, particularly for long sequences. Supported by both theory and experiments, this saturation pattern suggests that later layers can operate more efficiently with reduced parameters. Combining these insights, we propose principled strategies for allocating attention heads and dimensions across Transformers' layers, shedding light on theoretically-grounded model efficiency of Transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: The batched multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which rewards are collected in batches, is crucial for applications such as clinical trials. Existing research predominantly assumes light-tailed reward distributions, yet many real-world scenarios, including clinical outcomes, exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics. This paper bridges this gap by proposing robust batched bandit algorithms designed for heavy-tailed rewards, within both finite-arm and Lipschitz-continuous settings. We reveal a surprising phenomenon: in the instance-independent regime, as well as in the Lipschitz setting, heavier-tailed rewards necessitate a smaller number of batches to achieve near-optimal regret. In stark contrast, for the instance-dependent setting, the required number of batches to attain near-optimal regret remains invariant with respect to tail heaviness.

Abstract: Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.

Abstract: On-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most important token logits to balance computational cost and projection effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language Models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across datasets, model families, and advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final success rates.

Abstract: High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state, environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric deterministic method for distributed area coverage, validating the MARL approach and providing a foundation for more complex autonomous multi-HAB missions where deterministic methods become intractable.

Abstract: The task of learning a diffusion-based neural sampler for drawing samples from an unnormalized target distribution can be viewed as a stochastic optimal control problem on path measures. However, the training of neural samplers can be challenging when the target distribution is multimodal with significant barriers separating the modes, potentially leading to mode collapse. We propose a framework named \textbf{Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler (PDNS)} that addresses these challenges by tackling the stochastic optimal control problem via proximal point method on the space of path measures. PDNS decomposes the learning process into a series of simpler subproblems that create a path gradually approaching the desired distribution. This staged procedure traces a progressively refined path to the desired distribution and promotes thorough exploration across modes. For a practical and efficient realization, we instantiate each proximal step with a proximal weighted denoising cross-entropy (WDCE) objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PDNS through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete sampling tasks, including challenging scenarios in molecular dynamics and statistical physics.

<title>HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control</title>

Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.

Abstract: When training data are fragmented across batches or federated-learned across different geographic locations, trained models manifest performance degradation. That degradation partly owes to covariate shift induced by data having been fragmented across time and space and producing dissimilar empirical training distributions. Each fragment's distribution is slightly different to a hypothetical unfragmented training distribution of covariates, and to the single validation distribution. To address this problem, we propose Fisher Information for Robust fEderated validation (\textbf{FIRE}). This method accumulates fragmentation-induced covariate shift divergences from the global training distribution via an approximate Fisher information. That term, which we prove to be a more computationally-tractable estimate, is then used as a per-fragment loss penalty, enabling scalable distribution alignment. FIRE outperforms importance weighting benchmarks by $5.1\%$ at maximum and federated learning (FL) benchmarks by up to $5.3\%$ on shifted validation sets.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for M-FISHER, a method for sequential distribution shift detection and stable adaptation in streaming data. For detection, we construct an exponential martingale from non-conformity scores and apply Ville's inequality to obtain time-uniform guarantees on false alarm control, ensuring statistical validity at any stopping time. Under sustained shifts, we further bound the expected detection delay as $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\delta)/\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ reflects the post-shift information gain, thereby linking detection efficiency to distributional divergence. For adaptation, we show that Fisher-preconditioned updates of prompt parameters implement natural gradient descent on the distributional manifold, yielding locally optimal updates that minimize KL divergence while preserving stability and parameterization invariance. Together, these results establish M-FISHER as a principled approach for robust, anytime-valid detection and geometrically stable adaptation in sequential decision-making under covariate shift.

<title>On Using Large Language Models to Enhance Clinically-Driven Missing Data Recovery Algorithms in Electronic Health Records</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03844</link>

Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and errors. Previously, we devised an "enriched" chart review protocol where a "roadmap" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients, we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more, missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap. Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing EHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to large samples. Extending them to monitor other dimensions of data quality (e.g., plausability) is a promising future direction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The recently introduced optimizer, Muon, has gained increasing attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of applications. However, its effectiveness in federated learning remains unexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the performance of Muon in the federated learning setting. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, FedMuon, and establish its convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals multiple favorable properties of FedMuon. In particular, due to its orthonormalized update direction, the learning rate of FedMuon is independent of problem-specific parameters, and, importantly, it can naturally accommodate heavy-tailed noise. The extensive experiments on a variety of neural network architectures validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. Using the Scion optimizer, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and dataset sizes is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are consistent with those of the Adam optimizer. Tuning per-layer-group learning rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support research on LLM training dynamics at scale.

Abstract: Optimal design under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in advancing reliable, next-generation process systems. Robust optimization (RO) offers a principled approach by safeguarding against worst-case scenarios across a range of uncertain parameters. However, traditional RO methods typically require known problem structure, which limits their applicability to high-fidelity simulation environments. To overcome these limitations, recent work has explored robust Bayesian optimization (RBO) as a flexible alternative that can accommodate expensive, black-box objectives. Existing RBO methods, however, generally ignore available structural information and struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce BONSAI (Bayesian Optimization of Network Systems under uncertAInty), a new RBO framework that leverages partial structural knowledge commonly available in simulation-based models. Instead of treating the objective as a monolithic black box, BONSAI represents it as a directed graph of interconnected white- and black-box components, allowing the algorithm to utilize intermediate information within the optimization process. We further propose a scalable Thompson sampling-based acquisition function tailored to the structured RO setting, which can be efficiently optimized using gradient-based methods. We evaluate BONSAI across a diverse set of synthetic and real-world case studies, including applications in process systems engineering. Compared to existing simulation-based RO algorithms, BONSAI consistently delivers more sample-efficient and higher-quality robust solutions, highlighting its practical advantages for uncertainty-aware design in complex engineering systems.

<title>LLM as an Algorithmist: Enhancing Anomaly Detectors via Programmatic Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods for tabular data usually rely on some assumptions about anomaly patterns, leading to inconsistent performance in real-world scenarios. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable reasoning capabilities, their direct application to tabular AD is impeded by fundamental challenges, including difficulties in processing heterogeneous data and significant privacy risks. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor'' to an ``algorithmist''. Instead of being exposed to raw data, our framework leverages the LLM's ability to reason about algorithms. It analyzes a high-level description of a given detector to understand its intrinsic weaknesses and then generates detector-specific, data-agnostic Python code to synthesize ``hard-to-detect'' anomalies that exploit these vulnerabilities. This generated synthesis program, which is reusable across diverse datasets, is then instantiated to augment training data, systematically enhancing the detector's robustness by transforming the problem into a more discriminative two-class classification task. Extensive experiments on 36 TAD benchmarks show that LLM-DAS consistently boosts the performance of mainstream detectors. By bridging LLM reasoning with classic AD algorithms via programmatic synthesis, LLM-DAS offers a scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving approach to patching the logical blind spots of existing detectors.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection forms a very crucial area in several domains but poses substantial challenges. Due to time series data possessing seasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes very difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior. Anomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to contextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the dataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to the problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time detection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving at results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges, very strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper presents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that exploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts embeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and applies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral Decomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data. Our experiments show that this modular method achieves SOTA results on the MSL dataset and performs quite competitively on the SMAP and SWAT$^*$ datasets. Notably, THEMIS exceeds models trained specifically for anomaly detection, presenting hyperparameter robustness and interpretability by default. This paper advocates for pretrained representations from foundation models for performing efficient and adaptable anomaly detection for time series data.

Abstract: This paper focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) with clustered data, which is commonly encountered in healthcare applications. We propose a generalized fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithm that incorporates generalized estimating equations into policy learning to handle the intra-cluster correlations. Theoretically, we demonstrate (i) the optimalities of our Q-function and policy estimators when the correlation structure is correctly specified, and (ii) their consistencies when the structure is mis-specified. Empirically, through simulations and analyses of a mobile health dataset, we find the proposed generalized FQI achieves, on average, a half reduction in regret compared to the standard FQI.

Abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study online regression when the learner has access to predictions about future examples. In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the sequence of examples is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For this setting, we fully characterize the minimax expected regret in terms of the fat-shattering dimension, establishing a separation between transductive online regression and (adversarial) online regression. Then, we generalize this setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions about future examples. Using our results for the transductive online setting, we develop an online learner whose minimax expected regret matches the worst-case regret, improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the worst-case regret when future example predictions are precise, achieving performance similar to the transductive online learner. This enables learnability for previously unlearnable classes under predictable examples, aligning with the broader learning-augmented model paradigm.

Abstract: Continuous-depth graph neural networks, also known as Graph Neural Differential Equations (GNDEs), combine the structural inductive bias of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the continuous-depth architecture of Neural ODEs, offering a scalable and principled framework for modeling dynamics on graphs. In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from $\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining.

Abstract: Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) raise concerns about content authenticity and integrity because they can generate human-like text at scale. Text watermarks, which embed detectable statistical signals into generated text, offer a provable way to verify content origin. Many detection methods rely on pivotal statistics that are i.i.d. under human-written text, making goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests a natural tool for watermark detection. However, GoF tests remain largely underexplored in this setting. In this paper, we systematically evaluate eight GoF tests across three popular watermarking schemes, using three open-source LLMs, two datasets, various generation temperatures, and multiple post-editing methods. We find that general GoF tests can improve both the detection power and robustness of watermark detectors. Notably, we observe that text repetition, common in low-temperature settings, gives GoF tests a unique advantage not exploited by existing methods. Our results highlight that classic GoF tests are a simple yet powerful and underused tool for watermark detection in LLMs.

<title>What Is The Performance Ceiling of My Classifier? Utilizing Category-Wise Influence Functions for Pareto Frontier Analysis</title>

Abstract: Data-centric learning seeks to improve model performance from the perspective of data quality, and has been drawing increasing attention in the machine learning community. Among its key tools, influence functions provide a powerful framework to quantify the impact of individual training samples on model predictions, enabling practitioners to identify detrimental samples and retrain models on a cleaner dataset for improved performance. However, most existing work focuses on the question: "what data benefits the learning model?" In this paper, we take a step further and investigate a more fundamental question: "what is the performance ceiling of the learning model?" Unlike prior studies that primarily measure improvement through overall accuracy, we emphasize category-wise accuracy and aim for Pareto improvements, ensuring that every class benefits, rather than allowing tradeoffs where some classes improve at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose category-wise influence functions and introduce an influence vector that quantifies the impact of each training sample across all categories. Leveraging these influence vectors, we develop a principled criterion to determine whether a model can still be improved, and further design a linear programming-based sample reweighting framework to achieve Pareto performance improvements. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, vision, and text benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating and achieving a model's performance improvement across multiple categories of interest.

<title>Optimizing Resources for On-the-Fly Label Estimation with Multiple Unknown Medical Experts</title>

Abstract: Accurate ground truth estimation in medical screening programs often relies on coalitions of experts and peer second opinions. Algorithms that efficiently aggregate noisy annotations can enhance screening workflows, particularly when data arrive continuously and expert proficiency is initially unknown. However, existing algorithms do not meet the requirements for seamless integration into screening pipelines. We therefore propose an adaptive approach for real-time annotation that (I) supports on-the-fly labeling of incoming data, (II) operates without prior knowledge of medical experts or pre-labeled data, and (III) dynamically queries additional experts based on the latent difficulty of each instance. The method incrementally gathers expert opinions until a confidence threshold is met, providing accurate labels with reduced annotation overhead. We evaluate our approach on three multi-annotator classification datasets across different modalities. Results show that our adaptive querying strategy reduces the number of expert queries by up to 50% while achieving accuracy comparable to a non-adaptive baseline.

<title>Early-Warning of Thunderstorm-Driven Power Outages with a Two-Stage Machine Learning Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03959</link>

Abstract: Thunderstorm-driven outages are difficult to predict because most storms do not cause damage, convective processes occur rapidly and chaotically, and the available public data are both noisy and incomplete. We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap.
  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.

<title>SPEAR: Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition for Time Series Data</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, such as healthcare and internet traffic monitoring. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences, as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.

<title>What Can You Do When You Have Zero Rewards During RL?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based rewards has proven effective for improving large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, its success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct solutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a zero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this scenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and evaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense rewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments show that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base model never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple data-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables the model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero reward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself. Because official implementations of several baselines were unavailable, we developed our own, which allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of their failure modes. We release these implementations to support further research at: https://github.com/rl4reasoning/rl-baselines

Abstract: We establish a link between a class of discrete choice models and the theory of online learning and multi-armed bandits. Our contributions are: (i) sublinear regret bounds for a broad algorithmic family, encompassing Exp3 as a special case; (ii) a new class of adversarial bandit algorithms derived from generalized nested logit models \citep{wen:2001}; and (iii) \textcolor{black}{we introduce a novel class of generalized gradient bandit algorithms that extends beyond the widely used softmax formulation. By relaxing the restrictive independence assumptions inherent in softmax, our framework accommodates correlated learning dynamics across actions, thereby broadening the applicability of gradient bandit methods.} Overall, the proposed algorithms combine flexible model specification with computational efficiency via closed-form sampling probabilities. Numerical experiments in stochastic bandit settings demonstrate their practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Hierarchical Pooling Models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying graph-structured data. While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural network architectures.

<title>Distilling Reasoning into Student LLMs: Local Naturalness for Selecting Teacher Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03988</link>

arXiv:2510.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling long reasoning traces (10K+ tokens) from stronger teacher models into smaller student LLMs via SFT has emerged as a standard paradigm. This approach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating abundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven way to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has largely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the equally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher outputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge becomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may benefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with a systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first show that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the highest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come from multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with downstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers become longer. To overcome this problem, we introduce Local Naturalness, which measures the student's log-probabilities over short, sequential reasoning steps conditioned only on a small local window. Local Naturalness enables two applications: 1) Teacher Selection: Aggregating local scores across prompts reliably identifies the most helpful teacher. 2) Response Selection from a Multiple Teachers: When mixing answers from many teachers, Local Naturalness boosts a 32B student's accuracy on math benchmarks by 9.4pp over global selection, also surpassing the performance achieved by training on data from the single best teacher. These results highlight the power of localized data quality evaluation and data mixing for more effective reasoning distillation.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of sequence modeling and underpins the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs). However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its structure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel continuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a discretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this formulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local integral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to a time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational perspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the architecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and normalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by embedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token indices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible framework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new directions for architecture design, analysis, and control-based interpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the gap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling, and contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of interpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.

Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting, leading to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.

<title>Replacing Softmax Similarity with a Sharpened Angular Similarity: Theory and Practice of Scaling To Billion-Context Attention</title>

Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity, which becomes prohibitive to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example, FlashAttention (an exact, GPU-optimized implementation of Softmax Attention) cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a multi-head attention layer once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We introduce RACE Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention that is linear in sequence length and embedding dimension. RACE Attention replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular (cosine) similarity, and approximates attention outputs via randomized projections and soft Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Across language modeling, masked language modeling, and text classification, RACE Attention matches the accuracy of strong baselines while reducing runtime and memory. In a controlled scale test, it processes up to 12 million tokens during a single forward-backward pass on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU, well beyond the practical limits of the current state-of-the-art attention implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical, theoretically grounded mechanism for outrageously long context windows on today's hardware. We hope that it gets adopted in practice.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g. reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and 1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO. Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: To address the dual challenges of inherent stochasticity and non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP), a new paradigm grounded in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.

Abstract: With the increasing need to safeguard data privacy in machine learning models, differential privacy (DP) is one of the major frameworks to build privacy-preserving models. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used traditional machine learning models due to their robust margin guarantees and strong empirical performance in binary classification. However, applying DP to multi-class SVMs is inadequate, as the standard one-versus-rest (OvR) and one-versus-one (OvO) approaches repeatedly query each data sample when building multiple binary classifiers, thus consuming the privacy budget proportionally to the number of classes. To overcome this limitation, we explore all-in-one SVM approaches for DP, which access each data sample only once to construct multi-class SVM boundaries with margin maximization properties. We propose a novel differentially Private Multi-class SVM (PMSVM) with weight and gradient perturbation methods, providing rigorous sensitivity and convergence analyses to ensure DP in all-in-one SVMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing DP-SVM methods in multi-class scenarios.

<title>The Debate on RLVR Reasoning Capability Boundary: Shrinkage, Expansion, or Both? A Two-Stage Dynamic View</title>

Abstract: The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves sampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity, resulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate that prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning strategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both perspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an inherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially, the model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while rarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates increase the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward tokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during this stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of previously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach saturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage estimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of the originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that over-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary shrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an expansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we revisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging training, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development of more advanced reasoning capabilities.

<title>Adaptive kernel-density approach for imbalanced binary classification</title>

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world binary classification tasks, often leading to predictions biased toward the majority class and reduced recognition of the minority class. This issue is particularly critical in domains such as medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, where correct classification of minority classes is essential. Conventional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance when the imbalance ratio is extremely severe. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Kernel-density-Oriented Threshold Adjustment with Regional Optimization (KOTARO), which extends the framework of kernel density estimation (KDE) by adaptively adjusting decision boundaries according to local sample density. In KOTARO, the bandwidth of Gaussian basis functions is dynamically tuned based on the estimated density around each sample, thereby enhancing the classifier's ability to capture minority regions. We validated the effectiveness of KOTARO through experiments on both synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets. The results demonstrated that KOTARO outperformed conventional methods, particularly under conditions of severe imbalance, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for a wide range of imbalanced classification problems

Abstract: For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains, regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model

<title>What Scales in Cross-Entropy Scaling Law?</title>

Abstract: The cross-entropy scaling law has long served as a key tool for guiding the development of large language models. It shows that cross-entropy loss decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However, recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead, only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy, Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and future development of large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.

Abstract: This article introduces the theory of offline reinforcement learning in large state spaces, where good policies are learned from historical data without online interactions with the environment. Key concepts introduced include expressivity assumptions on function approximation (e.g., Bellman completeness vs. realizability) and data coverage (e.g., all-policy vs. single-policy coverage). A rich landscape of algorithms and results is described, depending on the assumptions one is willing to make and the sample and computational complexity guarantees one wishes to achieve. We also discuss open questions and connections to adjacent areas.

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN) training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating versatility of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning and complementary multi-label learning are two popular weakly supervised multi-label classification paradigms that aim to alleviate the high annotation costs of collecting precisely annotated multi-label data. In partial multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with a candidate label set, among which only some labels are relevant; in complementary multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with complementary labels indicating the classes to which the instance does not belong. Existing consistent approaches for the two paradigms either require accurate estimation of the generation process of candidate or complementary labels or assume a uniform distribution to eliminate the estimation problem. However, both conditions are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose consistent approaches that do not rely on the aforementioned conditions to handle both problems in a unified way. Specifically, we propose two unbiased risk estimators based on first- and second-order strategies. Theoretically, we prove consistency w.r.t. two widely used multi-label classification evaluation metrics and derive convergence rates for the estimation errors of the proposed risk estimators. Empirically, extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.

Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is a critical concern, yet most research has focused on classification tasks, leaving regression models underexplored. This paper introduces a Wasserstein projection-based framework for fairness testing in regression models, focusing on expectation-based criteria. We propose a hypothesis-testing approach and an optimal data perturbation method to improve fairness while balancing accuracy. Theoretical results include a detailed categorization of fairness criteria for regression, a dual reformulation of the Wasserstein projection test statistic, and the derivation of asymptotic bounds and limiting distributions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method offers higher specificity compared to permutation-based tests, and effectively detects and mitigates biases in real applications such as student performance and housing price prediction.

<title>On the Statistical Query Complexity of Learning Semiautomata: a Random Walk Approach</title>

Abstract: Semiautomata form a rich class of sequence-processing algorithms with applications in natural language processing, robotics, computational biology, and data mining. We establish the first Statistical Query hardness result for semiautomata under the uniform distribution over input words and initial states. We show that Statistical Query hardness can be established when both the alphabet size and input length are polynomial in the number of states. Unlike the case of deterministic finite automata, where hardness typically arises through the hardness of the language they recognize (e.g., parity), our result is derived solely from the internal state-transition structure of semiautomata. Our analysis reduces the task of distinguishing the final states of two semiautomata to studying the behavior of a random walk on the group $S_{N} \times S_{N}$. By applying tools from Fourier analysis and the representation theory of the symmetric group, we obtain tight spectral gap bounds, demonstrating that after a polynomial number of steps in the number of states, distinct semiautomata become nearly uncorrelated, yielding the desired hardness result.

Abstract: Cold-start drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction focuses on interaction between novel drugs and proteins. Previous methods typically learn transferable interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it. However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary) and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors, avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.

Abstract: In Transformers, Position Embeddings (PEs) significantly influence Length Generalization (LG) performance, yet their fundamental role remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the limitations and capabilities of PEs in achieving LG. We theoretically analyze PEs in Position-Only Linear Attentions (POLAs), introducing Linear Representation Complexity (LRC) to characterize when PEs enable LG. Our analysis shows that PEs do not expand computational capabilities but structure learned computations across positions. Extending to practical Transformers, we propose Sequential Representation Complexity (SRC) and conjecture that LG is possible if and only if SRC remains invariant across scales. We support this hypothesis with empirical evidence in various reasoning tasks. To enhance LG, we introduce Scale Hint, allowing flexible instance scaling, and a Learning-Based Position Embedding framework that automatically learns positional relations. Our work provides theoretical insights and practical strategies for improving LG in Transformers.

Abstract: Neural ODEs (NODEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling time series data, offering the flexibility to adapt to varying input scales and capture complex dynamics. However, they face significant challenges: first, their reliance on time-domain representations often limits their ability to capture long-term dependencies and periodic structures; second, the inherent mismatch between their continuous-time formulation and the discrete nature of real-world data can lead to loss of granularity and predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose Fourier Ordinary Differential Equations (FODEs), an approach that embeds the dynamics in the Fourier domain. By transforming time-series data into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), FODEs uncover global patterns and periodic behaviors that remain elusive in the time domain. Additionally, we introduce a learnable element-wise filtering mechanism that aligns continuous model outputs with discrete observations, preserving granularity and enhancing accuracy. Experiments on various time series datasets demonstrate that FODEs outperform existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. By effectively capturing both long- and short-term patterns, FODEs provide a robust framework for modeling time series dynamics.

Abstract: Periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of time series data and has long played a central role in forecasting. Recent deep learning methods strengthen the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution, PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets, where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/neumyor/PhaseFormer_TSL

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) have garnered significant attention for their design of continuous-depth neural networks and the ability to learn data/feature dynamics. However, for high-dimensional systems, estimating dynamics requires extensive calculations and suffers from high truncation errors for the ODE solvers. To address the issue, one intuitive approach is to consider the non-trivial topological space of the data distribution, i.e., a low-dimensional manifold. Existing methods often rely on knowledge of the manifold for projection or implicit transformation, restricting the ODE solutions on the manifold. Nevertheless, such knowledge is usually unknown in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to explore the underlying manifold to restrict the ODE process. Specifically, we employ a structure-preserved encoder to process data and find the underlying graph to approximate the manifold. Moreover, we propose novel methods to combine the NODE learning with the manifold, resulting in significant gains in computational speed and accuracy. Our experimental evaluations encompass multiple datasets, where we compare the accuracy, number of function evaluations (NFEs), and convergence speed of our model against existing baselines. Our results demonstrate superior performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved latency relative to ARMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly focused on non-asymptotic convergence analyses for actor-critic (AC) algorithms. One such effort introduced a two-timescale critic-actor algorithm for the discounted cost setting using a tabular representation, where the usual roles of the actor and critic are reversed. However, only asymptotic convergence was established there. Subsequently, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses of the critic-actor algorithm with linear function approximation were conducted. In our work, we introduce the first natural critic-actor algorithm with function approximation for the long-run average cost setting and under inequality constraints. We provide the non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for this algorithm. Our analysis establishes optimal learning rates and we also propose a modification to enhance sample complexity. We further show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments where our algorithm is found to be competitive in comparison with other well known algorithms.

Abstract: Loss explosions in training deep neural networks can nullify multi-million dollar training runs. Conventional monitoring metrics like weight and gradient norms are often lagging and ambiguous predictors, as their values vary dramatically across different models and even between layers of the same model, making it difficult to establish a unified standard for detecting impending failure. We introduce Spectral Alignment (SA), a novel, theoretically-grounded metric that monitors the distributional alignment between layer inputs and the principal singular vectors of weight matrices. We show that a collapse in the sign diversity of this alignment is a powerful early predictor of representational collapse and training divergence. Empirical results on language models demonstrate that monitoring the SA distribution provides a significantly earlier and clearer warning of loss explosions than traditional scalar metrics. SA's low computational overhead makes it a practical tool for safeguarding model training.

Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is critical for stable and efficient convergence of heterogeneous federated learning, where clients differ in computational capabilities, and data distributions are non-IID. Tuning hyperparameters is a manual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows combinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an end-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central agents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters. Our approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to draw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this perspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the system for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and central servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from numerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated learning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are dynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By designing a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and central agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of heterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client drift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being insensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited for rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for heterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning both client and server updates.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering enhanced interpretability and a strong mathematical foundation. However, their parameter efficiency remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. This paper introduces PolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal guarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging the inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the compression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a rigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of $\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal compression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time complexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal foundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new directions for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures.

<title>Why Low-Precision Transformer Training Fails: An Analysis on Flash Attention</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to catastrophic loss explosions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a practical solution to this persistent problem.

<title>MLLMEraser: Achieving Test-Time Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models through Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

Abstract: Modeling 3D dynamics is a fundamental problem in multi-body systems across scientific and engineering domains and has important practical implications in trajectory prediction and simulation. While recent GNN-based approaches have achieved strong performance by enforcing geometric symmetries, encoding high-order features or incorporating neural-ODE mechanics, they typically depend on explicitly observed structures and inherently fail to capture the unobserved interactions that are crucial to complex physical behaviors and dynamics mechanism. In this paper, we propose PAINET, a principled SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for learning all-pair interactions in multi-body systems. The model comprises: (1) a novel physics-inspired attention network derived from the minimization trajectory of an energy function, and (2) a parallel decoder that preserves equivariance while enabling efficient inference. Empirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human motion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show that PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to 41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation costs in terms of time and memory.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel kernel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for large-scale supervised learning with general losses. Compared to traditional kernel SGD, our algorithm improves efficiency and scalability through an innovative regularization strategy. By leveraging the infinite series expansion of spherical radial basis functions, this strategy projects the stochastic gradient onto a finite-dimensional hypothesis space, which is adaptively scaled according to the bias-variance trade-off, thereby enhancing generalization performance. Based on a new estimation of the spectral structure of the kernel-induced covariance operator, we develop an analytical framework that unifies optimization and generalization analyses. We prove that both the last iterate and the suffix average converge at minimax-optimal rates, and we further establish optimal strong convergence in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our framework accommodates a broad class of classical loss functions, including least-squares, Huber, and logistic losses. Moreover, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and achieves optimal storage complexity by incorporating coordinate-wise updates from linear SGD, thereby avoiding the costly pairwise operations typical of kernel SGD and enabling efficient processing of streaming data. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.

<title>Efficient Latent Variable Causal Discovery: Combining Score Search and Targeted Testing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04263</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but often performs exhaustive conditional independence tests across many subsets, leading to spurious independence claims, extra or missing edges, and unreliable orientations. We present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that build on this tradition. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI, straightforward variants of GFCI that substitute BOSS or GRaSP for FGES, thereby retaining correctness while incurring different scalability tradeoffs. Second, we develop FCI Targeted-testing (FCIT), a novel mixed-strategy method that improves upon these variants by replacing exhaustive all-subsets testing with targeted tests guided by BOSS, yielding well-formed PAGs with higher precision and efficiency. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic, LV-Dumb (also known as BOSS-POD), which bypasses latent-variable-specific reasoning and directly returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG. Although not strictly correct in the FCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice. Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI provide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and LV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance. Together, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted strategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.

Abstract: On the occasion of the 20th Mixed Integer Program Workshop's computational competition, this work introduces a new approach for learning to solve MIPs online. Influence branching, a new graph-oriented variable selection strategy, is applied throughout the first iterations of the branch and bound algorithm. This branching heuristic is optimized online with Thompson sampling, which ranks the best graph representations of MIP's structure according to computational speed up over SCIP. We achieve results comparable to state of the art online learning methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our method generalizes well to more general online frameworks, where variations in constraint matrix, constraint vector and objective coefficients can all occur and where more samples are available.

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization. However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC), a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique that adapts large pre-trained models by adding low-rank matrices to their weight updates. However, in the context of fine-tuning multi-head self-attention (MHA), LoRA has been employed to adapt each attention head separately, thereby overlooking potential synergies across different heads. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Hyper-shared Low-Rank Adaptation (HoRA) method, which utilizes joint hypernetworks to generate low-rank matrices across attention heads. By coupling their adaptation through a shared generator, HoRA encourages cross-head information sharing, and thus directly addresses the aforementioned limitation of LoRA. By comparing LoRA and HoRA through the lens of hierarchical mixture of experts, our theoretical findings reveal that the latter achieves superior sample efficiency to the former. Furthermore, through extensive experiments across diverse language and vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that HoRA outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods while requiring only a marginal increase in the number of trainable parameters.

Abstract: We introduce Wave-PDE Nets, a neural architecture whose elementary operation is a differentiable simulation of the second-order wave equation. Each layer propagates its hidden state as a continuous field through a medium with trainable spatial velocity c(x) and damping {\gamma}(x). A symplectic spectral solver based on FFTs realises this propagation in O(nlog n) time. This oscillatory, global mechanism provides a powerful alternative to attention and first-order state-space models. We prove that a single Wave-PDE layer is a universal approximator. On language and vision benchmarks, Wave-PDE Nets match or exceed Transformer performance while demonstrating superior practical efficiency, reducing wall-clock time by up to 30% and peak memory by 25%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of symplectic integration and a spectral Laplacian for stability and performance. Visualizations of the learned physical parameters reveal that the model learns intuitive strategies for information propagation. These results position Wave-PDE Nets as a computationally efficient and robust architecture with a strong physical inductive bias.

Abstract: Controlling the behaviors of large language models (LLM) is fundamental to their safety alignment and reliable deployment. However, existing steering methods are primarily driven by empirical insights and lack theoretical performance guarantees. In this work, we develop a control-theoretic foundation for activation steering by showing that popular steering methods correspond to the proportional (P) controllers, with the steering vector serving as the feedback signal. Building on this finding, we propose Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Steering, a principled framework that leverages the full PID controller for activation steering in LLMs. The proportional (P) term aligns activations with target semantic directions, the integral (I) term accumulates errors to enforce persistent corrections across layers, and the derivative (D) term mitigates overshoot by counteracting rapid activation changes. This closed-loop design yields interpretable error dynamics and connects activation steering to classical stability guarantees in control theory. Moreover, PID Steering is lightweight, modular, and readily integrates with state-of-the-art steering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and benchmarks demonstrate that PID Steering consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving more robust and reliable behavioral control.

Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of crash severity is crucial in mitigating the severe consequences of traffic accidents. Accurate and timely prediction of crash severity is crucial in mitigating the severe consequences of traffic accidents. In order to provide appropriate levels of medical assistance and transportation services, an intelligent transportation system relies on effective prediction methods. Deep learning models have gained popularity in this domain due to their capability to capture non-linear relationships among variables. In this research, we have implemented a hybrid CNN-RNN deep learning model for crash severity prediction and compared its performance against widely used statistical and machine learning models such as logistic regression, na\"ive bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and individual deep learning models: RNN and CNN. This study employs a methodology that considers the interconnected relationships between various features of traffic accidents. The study was conducted using a dataset of 15,870 accident records gathered over a period of seven years between 2015 and 2021 on Virginia highway I-64. The findings demonstrate that the proposed CNN-RNN hybrid model has outperformed all benchmark models in terms of predicting crash severity. This result illustrates the effectiveness of the hybrid model as it combines the advantages of both RNN and CNN models in order to achieve greater accuracy in the prediction process.

Abstract: Training fair and unbiased machine learning models is crucial for high-stakes applications, yet it presents significant challenges. Effective bias mitigation requires deep expertise in fairness definitions, metrics, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. In addition, the complex process of balancing model performance with fairness requirements while properly handling sensitive attributes makes fairness-aware model development inaccessible to many practitioners. To address these challenges, we introduce FairAgent, an LLM-powered automated system that significantly simplifies fairness-aware model development. FairAgent eliminates the need for deep technical expertise by automatically analyzing datasets for potential biases, handling data preprocessing and feature engineering, and implementing appropriate bias mitigation strategies based on user requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that FairAgent achieves significant performance improvements while significantly reducing development time and expertise requirements, making fairness-aware machine learning more accessible to practitioners.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.

arXiv:2510.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P (AM-$\mu$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot \mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$\mu$P yields width-robust depth laws that transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate satisfies $\eta^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general conv+MLP blocks, we establish $\eta^\star(L)=\Theta(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$ scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without additional tuning overhead.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

Abstract: Many high-stakes AI applications target low-prevalence events, where apparent accuracy can conceal limited real-world value. Relevant AI models range from expert-defined rules and traditional machine learning to generative LLMs constrained for classification. We outline key considerations for critical appraisal of AI in rare-event recognition, including problem framing and test set design, prevalence-aware statistical evaluation, robustness assessment, and integration into human workflows. In addition, we propose an approach to structured case-level examination (SCLE), to complement statistical performance evaluation, and a comprehensive checklist to guide procurement or development of AI models for rare-event recognition. We instantiate the framework in pharmacovigilance, drawing on three studies: rule-based retrieval of pregnancy-related reports; duplicate detection combining machine learning with probabilistic record linkage; and automated redaction of person names using an LLM. We highlight pitfalls specific to the rare-event setting including optimism from unrealistic class balance and lack of difficult positive controls in test sets - and show how cost-sensitive targets align model performance with operational value. While grounded in pharmacovigilance practice, the principles generalize to domains where positives are scarce and error costs may be asymmetric.

<title>Learning to Predict Chaos: Curriculum-Driven Training for Robust Forecasting of Chaotic Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic systems is a cornerstone challenge in many scientific fields, complicated by the exponential amplification of even infinitesimal prediction errors. Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two opposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system (e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing vast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances of any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting (CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data based on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a curriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex, chaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first training a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more chaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable representation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic ODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that pre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world benchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and human ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40% compared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training on real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across various neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations to validate the importance of the curriculum's structure.

<title>From News to Returns: A Granger-Causal Hypergraph Transformer on the Sphere</title>

Abstract: We propose the Causal Sphere Hypergraph Transformer (CSHT), a novel architecture for interpretable financial time-series forecasting that unifies \emph{Granger-causal hypergraph structure}, \emph{Riemannian geometry}, and \emph{causally masked Transformer attention}. CSHT models the directional influence of financial news and sentiment on asset returns by extracting multivariate Granger-causal dependencies, which are encoded as directional hyperedges on the surface of a hypersphere. Attention is constrained via angular masks that preserve both temporal directionality and geometric consistency. Evaluated on S\&amp;P 500 data from 2018 to 2023, including the 2020 COVID-19 shock, CSHT consistently outperforms baselines across return prediction, regime classification, and top-asset ranking tasks. By enforcing predictive causal structure and embedding variables in a Riemannian manifold, CSHT delivers both \emph{robust generalisation across market regimes} and \emph{transparent attribution pathways} from macroeconomic events to stock-level responses. These results suggest that CSHT is a principled and practical solution for trustworthy financial forecasting under uncertainty.

<title>Quantifying Ambiguity in Categorical Annotations: A Measure and Statistical Inference Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04366</link>

Abstract: Human-generated categorical annotations frequently produce empirical response distributions (soft labels) that reflect ambiguity rather than simple annotator error. We introduce an ambiguity measure that maps a discrete response distribution to a scalar in the unit interval, designed to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in categorical tasks. The measure bears a close relationship to quadratic entropy (Gini-style impurity) but departs from those indices by treating an explicit "can't solve" category asymmetrically, thereby separating uncertainty arising from class-level indistinguishability from uncertainty due to explicit unresolvability. We analyze the measure's formal properties and contrast its behavior with a representative ambiguity measure from the literature. Moving beyond description, we develop statistical tools for inference: we propose frequentist point estimators for population ambiguity and derive the Bayesian posterior over ambiguity induced by Dirichlet priors on the underlying probability vector, providing a principled account of epistemic uncertainty. Numerical examples illustrate estimation, calibration, and practical use for dataset-quality assessment and downstream machine-learning workflows.

Abstract: We introduce GDPval, a benchmark evaluating AI model capabilities on real-world economically valuable tasks. GDPval covers the majority of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Activities for 44 occupations across the top 9 sectors contributing to U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Tasks are constructed from the representative work of industry professionals with an average of 14 years of experience. We find that frontier model performance on GDPval is improving roughly linearly over time, and that the current best frontier models are approaching industry experts in deliverable quality. We analyze the potential for frontier models, when paired with human oversight, to perform GDPval tasks cheaper and faster than unaided experts. We also demonstrate that increased reasoning effort, increased task context, and increased scaffolding improves model performance on GDPval. Finally, we open-source a gold subset of 220 tasks and provide a public automated grading service at evals.openai.com to facilitate future research in understanding real-world model capabilities.

<title>Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures, while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted by the vast, generic dataset.
  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing them from being overshadowed.
  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs, complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music) with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods, particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network training is typically viewed as gradient descent on a loss surface. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: learning is a structure-preserving transformation (a functor L) between the space of network parameters (Param) and the space of learned representations (Rep). This categorical framework reveals that different training runs producing similar test performance often belong to the same homotopy class (continuous deformation family) of optimization paths. We show experimentally that networks converging via homotopic trajectories generalize within 0.5% accuracy of each other, while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%. The theory provides practical tools: persistent homology identifies stable minima predictive of generalization (R^2 = 0.82 correlation), pullback constructions formalize transfer learning, and 2-categorical structures explain when different optimization algorithms yield functionally equivalent models. These categorical invariants offer both theoretical insight into why deep learning works and concrete algorithmic principles for training more robust networks.

<title>Score-based Greedy Search for Structure Identification of Partially Observed Linear Causal Models</title>

Abstract: Identifying the structure of a partially observed causal system is essential to various scientific fields. Recent advances have focused on constraint-based causal discovery to solve this problem, and yet in practice these methods often face challenges related to multiple testing and error propagation. These issues could be mitigated by a score-based method and thus it has raised great attention whether there exists a score-based greedy search method that can handle the partially observed scenario. In this work, we propose the first score-based greedy search method for the identification of structure involving latent variables with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we propose Generalized N Factor Model and establish the global consistency:
  the true structure including latent variables can be identified up to the Markov equivalence class by using score. We then design
  Latent variable Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a greedy search algorithm for this class of model with well-defined operators,
  which search very efficiently over the graph space to find the optimal structure. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data validate the effectiveness of our method (code will be publicly available).

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates dense data streams critical for diabetes management, but most used forecasting models lack interpretability for clinical use. We present SSM-CGM, a Mamba-based neural state-space forecasting model that integrates CGM and wearable activity signals from the AI-READI cohort. SSM-CGM improves short-term accuracy over a Temporal Fusion Transformer baseline, adds interpretability through variable selection and temporal attribution, and enables counterfactual forecasts simulating how planned changes in physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiration) affect near-term glucose. Together, these features make SSM-CGM an interpretable, physiologically grounded framework for personalized diabetes management.

<title>Partial Information Decomposition via Normalizing Flows in Latent Gaussian Distributions</title>

Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly, or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However, existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets and selecting high-performing models.

<title>Achieve Performatively Optimal Policy for Performative Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Performative reinforcement learning is an emerging dynamical decision making framework, which extends reinforcement learning to the common applications where the agent's policy can change the environmental dynamics. Existing works on performative reinforcement learning only aim at a performatively stable (PS) policy that maximizes an approximate value function. However, there is a provably positive constant gap between the PS policy and the desired performatively optimal (PO) policy that maximizes the original value function. In contrast, this work proposes a zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm (0-FW) algorithm with a zeroth-order approximation of the performative policy gradient in the Frank-Wolfe framework, and obtains \textbf{the first polynomial-time convergence to the desired PO} policy under the standard regularizer dominance condition. For the convergence analysis, we prove two important properties of the nonconvex value function. First, when the policy regularizer dominates the environmental shift, the value function satisfies a certain gradient dominance property, so that any stationary point (not PS) of the value function is a desired PO. Second, though the value function has unbounded gradient, we prove that all the sufficiently stationary points lie in a convex and compact policy subspace $\Pi_{\Delta}$, where the policy value has a constant lower bound $\Delta>0$ and thus the gradient becomes bounded and Lipschitz continuous. Experimental results also demonstrate that our 0-FW algorithm is more effective than the existing algorithms in finding the desired PO policy.

<title>Trade-off in Estimating the Number of Byzantine Clients in Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04432</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning has attracted increasing attention at recent large-scale optimization and machine learning research and applications, but is also vulnerable to Byzantine clients that can send any erroneous signals. Robust aggregators are commonly used to resist Byzantine clients. This usually requires to estimate the unknown number $f$ of Byzantine clients, and thus accordingly select the aggregators with proper degree of robustness (i.e., the maximum number $\hat{f}$ of Byzantine clients allowed by the aggregator). Such an estimation should have important effect on the performance, which has not been systematically studied to our knowledge. This work will fill in the gap by theoretically analyzing the worst-case error of aggregators as well as its induced federated learning algorithm for any cases of $\hat{f}$ and $f$. Specifically, we will show that underestimation ($\hat{f}<f$) can lead to arbitrarily poor performance for both aggregators and federated learning. For non-underestimation ($\hat{f}\ge f$), we have proved optimal lower and upper bounds of the same order on the errors of both aggregators and federated learning. All these optimal bounds are proportional to $\hat{f}/(n-f-\hat{f})$ with $n$ clients, which monotonically increases with larger $\hat{f}$. This indicates a fundamental trade-off: while an aggregator with a larger robustness degree $\hat{f}$ can solve federated learning problems of wider range $f\in [0,\hat{f}]$, the performance can deteriorate when there are actually fewer or even no Byzantine clients (i.e., $f\in [0,\hat{f})$).

Abstract: In this work, we introduce novel algorithms for label propagation and self-training using fractional heat kernel dynamics with a source term. We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.

arXiv:2510.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a new test domain for which no labeled data is available. A common finding in the DG literature is that it is difficult to outperform empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the pooled training data.
  In this work, we argue that this finding has primarily been reported for datasets satisfying a \emph{covariate shift} assumption. When the dataset satisfies a \emph{posterior drift} assumption instead, we show that ``domain-informed ERM,'' wherein feature vectors are augmented with domain-specific information, outperforms pooling ERM. These claims are supported by a theoretical framework and experiments on language and vision tasks.

Abstract: While accuracy is a critical requirement for time series forecasting models, an equally important (yet often overlooked) desideratum is forecast stability across forecast creation dates (FCDs). Even highly accurate models can produce erratic revisions between FCDs, undermining stakeholder trust and disrupting downstream decision-making. To improve forecast stability, models like MQCNN, MQT, and SPADE employ a little-known but highly effective technique: forking-sequences. Unlike standard statistical and neural forecasting methods that treat each FCD independently, the forking-sequences method jointly encodes and decodes the entire time series across all FCDs, in a way mirroring time series cross-validation. Since forking sequences remains largely unknown in the broader neural forecasting community, in this work, we formalize the forking-sequences approach, and we make a case for its broader adoption. We demonstrate three key benefits of forking-sequences: (i) more stable and consistent gradient updates during training; (ii) reduced forecast variance through ensembling; and (iii) improved inference computational efficiency. We validate forking-sequences' benefits using 16 datasets from the M1, M3, M4, and Tourism competitions, showing improvements in forecast percentage change stability of 28.8%, 28.8%, 37.9%, and 31.3%, and 8.8%, on average, for MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based architectures, respectively.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how increasing the number of neurons in a network without increasing its number of non-zero parameters improves performance. We show that this gain corresponds with a decrease in interference between multiple features that would otherwise share the same neurons. To reduce such entanglement at a fixed non-zero parameter count, we introduce Fixed Parameter Expansion (FPE): replace a neuron with multiple children and partition the parent's weights disjointly across them, so that each child inherits a non-overlapping subset of connections. On symbolic tasks, specifically Boolean code problems, clause-aligned FPE systematically reduces polysemanticity metrics and yields higher task accuracy. Notably, random splits of neuron weights approximate these gains, indicating that reduced collisions, not precise assignment, are a primary driver. Consistent with the superposition hypothesis, the benefits of FPE grow with increasing interference: when polysemantic load is high, accuracy improvements are the largest. Transferring these insights to real models (classifiers over CLIP embeddings and deeper multilayer networks) we find that widening networks while maintaining a constant non-zero parameter count consistently increases accuracy. These results identify an interpretability-grounded mechanism to leverage width against superposition, improving performance without increasing the number of non-zero parameters. Such a direction is well matched to modern accelerators, where memory movement of non-zero parameters, rather than raw compute, is the dominant bottleneck.

<title>Wavelet Predictive Representations for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The real world is inherently non-stationary, with ever-changing factors, such as weather conditions and traffic flows, making it challenging for agents to adapt to varying environmental dynamics. Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to sequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL approaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to limited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of Wavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture signal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain predictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these multi-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task representation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients represent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary changes. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time series forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update operator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically prove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with wavelet task representations. Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that WISDOM significantly outperforms existing baselines in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, demonstrating its remarkable adaptability in complex environments characterized by non-stationary and stochastically evolving tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for regulatory workflows in cities, where the Environmental Noise Directive mandates regular strategic noise maps and action plans, often needed in permission workflows, right-of-way allocation, and construction scheduling. Physics-based solvers are too slow for such time-critical, iterative "what-if" studies. We evaluate conditional Normalizing Flows (Full-Glow) for generating for generating standards-compliant urban sound-pressure maps from 2D urban layouts in real time per 256x256 map on a single RTX 4090), enabling interactive exploration directly on commodity hardware. On datasets covering Baseline, Diffraction, and Reflection regimes, our model accelerates map generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance assessments).

Abstract: Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks. Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.

<title>Graph-based Tabular Deep Learning Should Learn Feature Interactions, Not Just Make Predictions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04543</link>

Abstract: Despite recent progress, deep learning methods for tabular data still struggle to compete with traditional tree-based models. A key challenge lies in modeling complex, dataset-specific feature interactions that are central to tabular data. Graph-based tabular deep learning (GTDL) methods aim to address this by representing features and their interactions as graphs. However, existing methods predominantly optimize predictive accuracy, neglecting accurate modeling of the graph structure. This position paper argues that GTDL should move beyond prediction-centric objectives and prioritize the explicit learning and evaluation of feature interactions. Using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth graph structures, we show that existing GTDL methods fail to recover meaningful feature interactions. Moreover, enforcing the true interaction structure improves predictive performance. This highlights the need for GTDL methods to prioritize quantitative evaluation and accurate structural learning. We call for a shift toward structure-aware modeling as a foundation for building GTDL systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, trustworthy, and grounded in domain understanding.

<title>Post-training quantization of vision encoders needs prefixing registers</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e., outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision encoders.

<title>Tail-Safe Hedging: Explainable Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with a White-Box CBF--QP Safety Layer in Arbitrage-Free Markets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Tail-Safe, a deployability-oriented framework for derivatives hedging that unifies distributional, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with a white-box control-barrier-function (CBF) quadratic-program (QP) safety layer tailored to financial constraints. The learning component combines an IQN-based distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets, tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free, microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate methodological contributions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the identification of the top-m user-scheduling sets in multi-user MIMO downlink, which is cast as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem in stochastic linear bandits. Because the action space grows exponentially, exhaustive search is infeasible. We therefore adopt a linear utility model to enable efficient exploration and reliable selection of promising user subsets. We introduce a gap-index framework that maintains a shortlist of current estimates of champion arms (top-m sets) and a rotating shortlist of challenger arms that pose the greatest threat to the champions. This design focuses on measurements that yield the most informative gap-index-based comparisons, resulting in significant reductions in runtime and computation compared to state-of-the-art linear bandit methods, with high identification accuracy. The method also exposes a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Simulations on a realistic OFDM downlink show that shortlist-driven pure exploration makes online, measurement-efficient subcarrier selection practical for AI-enabled communication systems.

Abstract: Distortion Risk Measures (DRMs) capture risk preferences in decision-making and serve as general criteria for managing uncertainty. This paper proposes gradient descent algorithms for DRM optimization based on two dual representations: the Distortion-Measure (DM) form and Quantile-Function (QF) form. The DM-form employs a three-timescale algorithm to track quantiles, compute their gradients, and update decision variables, utilizing the Generalized Likelihood Ratio and kernel-based density estimation. The QF-form provides a simpler two-timescale approach that avoids the need for complex quantile gradient estimation. A hybrid form integrates both approaches, applying the DM-form for robust performance around distortion function jumps and the QF-form for efficiency in smooth regions. Proofs of strong convergence and convergence rates for the proposed algorithms are provided. In particular, the DM-form achieves an optimal rate of $O(k^{-4/7})$, while the QF-form attains a faster rate of $O(k^{-2/3})$. Numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines in robust portfolio selection tasks. The method's scalability is further illustrated through integration into deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a DRM-based Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm is developed and applied to multi-echelon dynamic inventory management, showcasing its practical applicability.

<title>GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the versatility and robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of geometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto geodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of hyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as probability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the Wasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by Optimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and computation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic rays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases: one-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable explicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, which in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over Gaussian mixtures and labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of those original schemes on synthetic datasets as well as transfer learning problems.

Abstract: Probabilistic regression models the entire predictive distribution of a response variable, offering richer insights than classical point estimates and directly allowing for uncertainty quantification. While diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable success in generating complex, high-dimensional data, their usage in general regression tasks often lacks uncertainty-related evaluation and remains limited to domain-specific applications. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for probabilistic regression that learns predictive distributions in a nonparametric way. More specifically, we propose to model the full distribution of the diffusion noise, enabling adaptation to diverse tasks and enhanced uncertainty quantification. We investigate different noise parameterizations, analyze their trade-offs, and evaluate our framework across a broad range of regression tasks, covering low- and high-dimensional settings. For several experiments, our approach shows superior performance against existing baselines, while delivering calibrated uncertainty estimates, demonstrating its versatility as a tool for probabilistic prediction.

Abstract: Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating between gradient descent steps on the backbone and closed-form updates on the last layer. We adapt the method for the setting of stochastic gradient descent, by trading off the loss on the current batch against the accumulated information from previous batches. Further, we prove that, in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, convergence of this method to an optimal solution is guaranteed. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with standard SGD on a squared loss in several supervised tasks -- both regression and classification -- including Fourier Neural Operators and Instrumental Variable Regression.

arXiv:2510.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on advanced forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets preserve essential temporal and spectral properties of real data, which enables robust analysis while effectively addressing data scarcity and privacy challenges. Our evaluations across multiple subjects demonstrate that the generated synthetic data can serve as an effective substitute for real data and also significantly boost AI model performance. The approach maintains critical biomedical features while provides high scalability for various applications and integrates seamlessly into open-source repositories, substantially expanding resources for AI-driven biomedical research.

Abstract: Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.

Abstract: Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations yield as much as a 7x speedup.

<title>IMLP: An Energy-Efficient Continual Learning Method for Tabular Data Streams</title>

Abstract: Tabular data streams are rapidly emerging as a dominant modality for real-time decision-making in healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These applications commonly run on edge and mobile devices, where energy budgets, memory, and compute are strictly limited. Continual learning (CL) addresses such dynamics by training models sequentially on task streams while preserving prior knowledge and consolidating new knowledge. While recent CL work has advanced in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving knowledge transfer, the practical requirements of energy and memory efficiency for tabular data streams remain underexplored. In particular, existing CL solutions mostly depend on replay mechanisms whose buffers grow over time and exacerbate resource costs.
  We propose a context-aware incremental Multi-Layer Perceptron (IMLP), a compact continual learner for tabular data streams. IMLP incorporates a windowed scaled dot-product attention over a sliding latent feature buffer, enabling constant-size memory and avoiding storing raw data. The attended context is concatenated with current features and processed by shared feed-forward layers, yielding lightweight per-segment updates. To assess practical deployability, we introduce NetScore-T, a tunable metric coupling balanced accuracy with energy for Pareto-aware comparison across models and datasets. IMLP achieves up to $27.6\times$ higher energy efficiency than TabNet and $85.5\times$ higher than TabPFN, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Overall, IMLP provides an easy-to-deploy, energy-efficient alternative to full retraining for tabular data streams.

<title>Noise or Signal? Deconstructing Contradictions and An Adaptive Remedy for Reversible Normalization in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) is a key technique enabling simple linear models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts (termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal a far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance of various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical contradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the standard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where its MSE surges by a staggering 683\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN prevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer, our adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic, unexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome uncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the instability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more damaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of this work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a shift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that reveals not only the surprising power of simple baselines but also the perilous nature of naive adaptation.

<title>Semantic Channel Equalization Strategies for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise", degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness; and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a prominent methodology for optimizing expensive black-box functions by leveraging Gaussian process surrogates, which focus on capturing the global characteristics of the objective function. However, in numerous practical scenarios, the primary objective is not to construct an exhaustive global surrogate, but rather to quickly pinpoint the global optimum. Due to the aleatoric nature of the sequential optimization problem and its dependence on the quality of the surrogate model and the initial design, it is restrictive to assume that all observed samples contribute equally to the discovery of the optimum in this context. In this paper, we introduce Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization (CCGBO), a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the contribution of individual historical observations through counterfactual credit. By incorporating counterfactual credit into the acquisition function, our approach can selectively allocate resources in areas where optimal solutions are most likely to occur. We prove that CCGBO retains sublinear regret. Empirical evaluations on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that CCGBO consistently reduces simple regret and accelerates convergence to the global optimum.

<title>Parameter-free Algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04685</link>

Abstract: We develop the first parameter-free algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, a framework that bridges adversarial and stochastic online convex optimization. Existing approaches for the SEA model require prior knowledge of problem-specific parameters, such as the diameter of the domain $D$ and the Lipschitz constant of the loss functions $G$, which limits their practical applicability. Addressing this, we develop parameter-free methods by leveraging the Optimistic Online Newton Step (OONS) algorithm to eliminate the need for these parameters. We first establish a comparator-adaptive algorithm for the scenario with unknown domain diameter but known Lipschitz constant, achieving an expected regret bound of $\tilde{O}\big(\|u\|_2^2 + \|u\|_2(\sqrt{\sigma^2_{1:T}} + \sqrt{\Sigma^2_{1:T}})\big)$, where $u$ is the comparator vector and $\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$ represent the cumulative stochastic variance and cumulative adversarial variation, respectively. We then extend this to the more general setting where both $D$ and $G$ are unknown, attaining the comparator- and Lipschitz-adaptive algorithm. Notably, the regret bound exhibits the same dependence on $\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed methods even when both parameters are unknown in the SEA model.

<title>How does the optimizer implicitly bias the model merging loss landscape?</title>

Abstract: Model merging methods combine models with different capabilities into a single one while maintaining the same inference cost. Two popular approaches are linear interpolation, which linearly interpolates between model weights, and task arithmetic, which combines task vectors obtained by the difference between finetuned and base models. While useful in practice, what properties make merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the optimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on merging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale -- unifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across architectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a non-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing this quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay, smaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the effective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work that connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual minima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when independently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the understanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its downstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of further manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.

Abstract: Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.

<title>Directional Sheaf Hypergraph Networks: Unifying Learning on Directed and Undirected Hypergraphs</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent higher-order interactions among multiple entities. While undirected hypergraphs have been extensively studied, the case of directed hypergraphs, which can model oriented group interactions, remains largely under-explored despite its relevance for many applications. Recent approaches in this direction often exhibit an implicit bias toward homophily, which limits their effectiveness in heterophilic settings. Rooted in the algebraic topology notion of Cellular Sheaves, Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) were introduced as an effective solution to circumvent such a drawback. While a generalization to hypergraphs is known, it is only suitable for undirected hypergraphs, failing to tackle the directed case. In this work, we introduce Directional Sheaf Hypergraph Networks (DSHN), a framework integrating sheaf theory with a principled treatment of asymmetric relations within a hypergraph. From it, we construct the Directed Sheaf Hypergraph Laplacian, a complex-valued operator by which we unify and generalize many existing Laplacian matrices proposed in the graph- and hypergraph-learning literature. Across 7 real-world datasets and against 13 baselines, DSHN achieves relative accuracy gains from 2% up to 20%, showing how a principled treatment of directionality in hypergraphs, combined with the expressive power of sheaves, can substantially improve performance.

Abstract: We study the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem within the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework under the Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) criterion. Our analysis considers a nonparametric setting, allowing for general reward distributions bounded in [0,1]. This formulation addresses the critical need for risk-averse decision-making in high-stakes environments, such as finance, moving beyond simple expected value optimization. We propose a $\delta$-correct, Track-and-Stop based algorithm and derive a corresponding lower bound on the expected sample complexity, which we prove is asymptotically matched. The implementation of our algorithm and the characterization of the lower bound both require solving a complex convex optimization problem and a related, simpler non-convex one.

<title>Provable Affine Identifiability of Nonlinear CCA under Latent Distributional Priors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04758</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish conditions under which nonlinear CCA recovers the ground-truth latent factors up to an orthogonal transform after whitening. Building on the classical result that linear mappings maximize canonical correlations under Gaussian priors, we prove affine identifiability for a broad class of latent distributions in the population setting. Central to our proof is a reparameterization result that transports the analysis from observation space to source space, where identifiability becomes tractable. We further show that whitening is essential for ensuring boundedness and well-conditioning, thereby underpinning identifiability. Beyond the population setting, we prove that ridge-regularized empirical CCA converges to its population counterpart, transferring these guarantees to the finite-sample regime. Experiments on a controlled synthetic dataset and a rendered image dataset validate our theory and demonstrate the necessity of its assumptions through systematic ablations.

<title>ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04767</link>

Abstract: While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.

<title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>

arXiv:2510.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.

<title>Distribution Preference Optimization: A Fine-grained Perspective for LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed \textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.

Abstract: Structural biology has made significant progress in determining membrane proteins, leading to a remarkable increase in the number of available structures in dedicated databases. The inherent complexity of membrane protein structures, coupled with challenges such as missing data, inconsistencies, and computational barriers from disparate sources, underscores the need for improved database integration. To address this gap, we present MetaMP, a framework that unifies membrane-protein databases within a web application and uses machine learning for classification. MetaMP improves data quality by enriching metadata, offering a user-friendly interface, and providing eight interactive views for streamlined exploration. MetaMP was effective across tasks of varying difficulty, demonstrating advantages across different levels without compromising speed or accuracy, according to user evaluations. Moreover, MetaMP supports essential functions such as structure classification and outlier detection.
  We present three practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in membrane protein research: predicting transmembrane segments, reconciling legacy databases, and classifying structures with explainable AI support. In a validation focused on statistics, MetaMP resolved 77% of data discrepancies and accurately predicted the class of newly identified membrane proteins 98% of the time and overtook expert curation. Altogether, MetaMP is a much-needed resource that harmonizes current knowledge and empowers AI-driven exploration of membrane-protein architecture.

Abstract: Humans are good at learning on the job: We learn how to solve the tasks we face as we go along. Can a model do the same? We propose an agent that assembles a task-specific curriculum, called test-time curriculum (TTC-RL), and applies reinforcement learning to continue training the model for its target task. The test-time curriculum avoids time-consuming human curation of datasets by automatically selecting the most task-relevant data from a large pool of available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that reinforcement learning on a test-time curriculum consistently improves the model on its target tasks, across a variety of evaluations and models. Notably, on challenging math and coding benchmarks, TTC-RL improves the pass@1 of Qwen3-8B by approximately 1.8x on AIME25 and 2.1x on CodeElo. Moreover, we find that TTC-RL significantly raises the performance ceiling compared to the initial model, increasing pass@8 on AIME25 from 40% to 62% and on CodeElo from 28% to 43%. Our findings show the potential of test-time curricula in extending the test-time scaling paradigm to continual training on thousands of task-relevant experiences during test-time.

<title>On Predicting Post-Click Conversion Rate via Counterfactual Inference</title>

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks. However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs. We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples. Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the theoretical significance and wide practical use of regular expressions, the computational complexity of learning them has been largely unexplored. We study the computational hardness of improperly learning regular expressions in the PAC model and with membership queries. We show that PAC learning is hard even under the uniform distribution on the hypercube, and also prove hardness of distribution-free learning with membership queries. Furthermore, if regular expressions are extended with complement or intersection, we establish hardness of learning with membership queries even under the uniform distribution. We emphasize that these results do not follow from existing hardness results for learning DFAs or NFAs, since the descriptive complexity of regular languages can differ exponentially between DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions.

Abstract: Bond Centered FingerPrint (BCFP) are a complementary, bond-centric alternative to Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). We introduce a static BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose BCFP-Sort&amp;Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.

Abstract: Causal Abstraction (CA) theory provides a principled framework for relating causal models that describe the same system at different levels of granularity while ensuring interventional consistency between them. Recently, several approaches for learning CAs have been proposed, but all assume fixed and well-specified exogenous distributions, making them vulnerable to environmental shifts and misspecification. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments, leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention mapping misspecification.

<title>Synthesising Counterfactual Explanations via Label-Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) provide recourse recommendations for individuals affected by algorithmic decisions. A key challenge is generating CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties. These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs. Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes, as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids. Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options, allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition, user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.

<title>Alignment Tipping Process: How Self-Evolution Pushes LLM Agents Off the Rails</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.

Abstract: Intraoperative pathology is pivotal to precision surgery, yet its clinical impact is constrained by diagnostic complexity and the limited availability of high-quality frozen-section data. While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.

Abstract: Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.

<title>Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04888</link>

Abstract: Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of "ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.

<title>Benchmarking M-LTSF: Frequency and Noise-Based Evaluation of Multivariate Long Time Series Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear (linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals. White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed, offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.

Abstract: Skills are essential for unlocking higher levels of problem solving. A common approach to discovering these skills is to learn ones that reliably reach different states, thus empowering the agent to control its environment. However, existing skill discovery algorithms often overlook the natural state variables present in many reinforcement learning problems, meaning that the discovered skills lack control of specific state variables. This can significantly hamper exploration efficiency, make skills more challenging to learn with, and lead to negative side effects in downstream tasks when the goal is under-specified. We introduce a general method that enables these skill discovery algorithms to learn focused skills -- skills that target and control specific state variables. Our approach improves state space coverage by a factor of three, unlocks new learning capabilities, and automatically avoids negative side effects in downstream tasks.

<title>DP-HYPE: Distributed Differentially Private Hyperparameter Search</title>

Abstract: The tuning of hyperparameters in distributed machine learning can substantially impact model performance. When the hyperparameters are tuned on sensitive data, privacy becomes an important challenge and to this end, differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for provable privacy. A standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients agree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters, like the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on differentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally expensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for each client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to undesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.
  In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed and privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting based on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE selects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of clients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning tasks. We prove that DP-HYPE preserves the strong notion of differential privacy called client-level differential privacy and, importantly, show that its privacy guarantees do not depend on the number of hyperparameters. We also provide bounds on its utility guarantees, that is, the probability of reaching a compromise, and implement DP-HYPE as a submodule in the popular Flower framework for distributed machine learning. In addition, we evaluate performance on multiple benchmark data sets in iid as well as multiple non-iid settings and demonstrate high utility of DP-HYPE even under small privacy budgets.

<title>How Different from the Past? Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04908</link>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/ST-SSDL.

<title>Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation</title>

Abstract: Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.

Abstract: Training automatic modulation classification (AMC) models on centrally aggregated data raises privacy concerns, incurs communication overhead, and often fails to confer robustness to channel shifts. Federated learning (FL) avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients, followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.

<title>Egalitarian Gradient Descent: A Simple Approach to Accelerated Grokking</title>

Abstract: Grokking is the phenomenon whereby, unlike the training performance, which peaks early in the training process, the test/generalization performance of a model stagnates over arbitrarily many epochs and then suddenly jumps to usually close to perfect levels. In practice, it is desirable to reduce the length of such plateaus, that is to make the learning process "grok" faster. In this work, we provide new insights into grokking. First, we show both empirically and theoretically that grokking can be induced by asymmetric speeds of (stochastic) gradient descent, along different principal (i.e singular directions) of the gradients. We then propose a simple modification that normalizes the gradients so that dynamics along all the principal directions evolves at exactly the same speed. Then, we establish that this modified method, which we call egalitarian gradient descent (EGD) and can be seen as a carefully modified form of natural gradient descent, groks much faster. In fact, in some cases the stagnation is completely removed. Finally, we empirically show that on classical arithmetic problems such as modular addition and sparse parity problem which this stagnation has been widely observed and intensively studied, that our proposed method eliminates the plateaus.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design process of high-performing architectures, but remains bottlenecked by expensive performance evaluation. Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural network architecture instantly.

Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient sequence models.

Abstract: When some parameters of a constrained optimization problem (COP) are uncertain, this gives rise to a predict-then-optimize (PtO) problem, comprising two stages -- the prediction of the unknown parameters from contextual information and the subsequent optimization using those predicted parameters. Decision-focused learning (DFL) implements the first stage by training a machine learning (ML) model to optimize the quality of the decisions made using the predicted parameters. When parameters in the constraints of a COP are predicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions. Therefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and decision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint parameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the underlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear program (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption. We derive two novel loss functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): the first one penalizes infeasibility (by penalizing when the predicted parameters lead to infeasible solutions), and the second one penalizes suboptimal decisions (by penalizing when the true optimal solution is infeasible under the predicted parameters). We introduce a single tunable parameter to form a weighted average of the two losses, allowing decision-makers to balance suboptimality and feasibility. We experimentally demonstrate that adjusting this parameter provides a decision-maker the control over the trade-off between the two. Moreover, across several COP instances, we find that for a single value of the tunable parameter, our method matches the performance of the existing baselines on suboptimality and feasibility.

This design provides flexibility and robust- ness, allowing users to tailor methods to specific time series characteristics. We demonstrate the package on simulated and real-world datasets, benchmark its performance against state-of-the- art tools such as Rbeast and autostsm, and discuss its role in interpretable machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are fundamental tools for evaluating machine learning classifiers, offering detailed insights into the trade-offs between true positive rate vs. false positive rate (ROC) or precision vs. recall (PR). However, in Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple clients, computing these curves is challenging due to privacy and communication constraints. Specifically, the server cannot access raw prediction scores and class labels, which are used to compute the ROC and PR curves in a centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel method for approximating ROC and PR curves in a federated setting by estimating quantiles of the prediction score distribution under distributed differential privacy. We provide theoretical bounds on the Area Error (AE) between the true and estimated curves, demonstrating the trade-offs between approximation accuracy, privacy, and communication cost. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high approximation accuracy with minimal communication and strong privacy guarantees, making it practical for privacy-preserving model evaluation in federated systems.

Abstract: The vast majority of modern deep learning models are trained with momentum-based first-order optimizers. The momentum term governs the optimizer's memory by determining how much each past gradient contributes to the current convergence direction. Fundamental momentum methods, such as Nesterov Accelerated Gradient and the Heavy Ball method, as well as more recent optimizers such as AdamW and Lion, all rely on the momentum coefficient that is customarily set to $\beta = 0.9$ and kept constant during model training, a strategy widely used by practitioners, yet suboptimal. In this paper, we introduce an \textit{adaptive memory} mechanism that replaces constant momentum with a dynamic momentum coefficient that is adjusted online during optimization. We derive our method by approximating the objective function using two planes: one derived from the gradient at the current iterate and the other obtained from the accumulated memory of the past gradients. To the best of our knowledge, such a proximal framework was never used for momentum-based optimization. Our proposed approach is novel, extremely simple to use, and does not rely on extra assumptions or hyperparameter tuning. We implement adaptive memory variants of both SGD and AdamW across a wide range of learning tasks, from simple convex problems to large-scale deep learning scenarios, demonstrating that our approach can outperform standard SGD and Adam with hand-tuned momentum coefficients. Finally, our work opens doors for new ways of inducing adaptivity in optimization.

Abstract: Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

<title>Rethinking Langevin Thompson Sampling from A Stochastic Approximation Perspective</title>

Abstract: Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However, they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in different round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific tuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this non-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic approximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a posterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy proposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary posterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed step-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior estimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds for TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by interpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process. Our empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with certain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are sometimes trained with imperfect oversight signals, leading to undesired behaviors such as reward hacking and sycophancy. Improving oversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that improve learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce Inoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that prevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to explicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we modify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only works on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we find that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially reducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which more strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more effectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this serves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is a simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning, preventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting desired capabilities.

Abstract: We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

<title>Test-Time Scaling in Diffusion LLMs via Hidden Semi-Autoregressive Experts</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%. Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a critical role in determining performance during inference.

Abstract: Machine learning in healthcare requires effective representation of structured medical codes, but current methods face a trade off: knowledge graph based approaches capture formal relationships but miss real world patterns, while data driven methods learn empirical associations but often overlook structured knowledge in medical terminologies. We present KEEP (Knowledge preserving and Empirically refined Embedding Process), an efficient framework that bridges this gap by combining knowledge graph embeddings with adaptive learning from clinical data. KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Importantly, KEEP produces final embeddings without task specific auxiliary or end to end training enabling KEEP to support multiple downstream applications and model architectures. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank and MIMIC IV demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and Language Model based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical outcomes. Moreover, KEEP's minimal computational requirements make it particularly suitable for resource constrained environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring robustness in high-stakes machine learning applications. We introduce HybridFlow, a modular hybrid architecture that unifies the modeling of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by combining a Conditional Masked Autoregressive normalizing flow for estimating aleatoric uncertainty with a flexible probabilistic predictor for epistemic uncertainty. The framework supports integration with any probabilistic model class, allowing users to easily adapt HybridFlow to existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.

Abstract: As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed under diverse memory and compute constraints. Existing approaches build model families by training each size independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only coarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that we call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher), one first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs intermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the student without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot interpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales smoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing pretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this type of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and student through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation thus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model families, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible adaptation across deployment environments. The code and models are available at https://github.com/dcml-lab/boomerang-distillation.

Abstract: This study presents a novel small-area estimation framework to enhance urban transportation planning through detailed characterization of travel behavior. Our approach improves on the four-step travel model by employing publicly available microdata files and machine learning methods to predict travel behavior for a representative, synthetic population at small geographic areas. This approach enables high-resolution estimation of trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment. Validation using ACS/PUMS work-commute datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves higher accuracy compared to conventional approaches. The resulting granular insights enable the tailoring of interventions to address localized situations and support a range of policy applications and targeted interventions, including the optimal placement of micro-fulfillment centers, effective curb-space management, and the design of more inclusive transportation solutions particularly for vulnerable communities.

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

<title>From Noisy Traces to Stable Gradients: Bias-Variance Optimized Preference Optimization for Aligning Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical tasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple, drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions, tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks. These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more stable training and stronger overall performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial market volatility is critical for risk management, derivatives pricing, and investment strategy. In this study, we propose a multitude of regime-switching methods to improve the prediction of S&amp;P 500 volatility by capturing structural changes in the market across time. We use eleven years of SPX data, from May 1st, 2014 to May 27th, 2025, to compute daily realized volatility (RV) from 5-minute intraday log returns, adjusted for irregular trading days. To enhance forecast accuracy, we engineered features to capture both historical dynamics and forward-looking market sentiment across regimes. The regime-switching methods include a soft Markov switching algorithm to estimate soft-regime probabilities, a distributional spectral clustering method that uses XGBoost to assign clusters at prediction time, and a coefficient-based soft regime algorithm that extracts HAR coefficients from time segments segmented through the Mood test and clusters through Bayesian GMM for soft regime weights, using XGBoost to predict regime probabilities. Models were evaluated across three time periods--before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The coefficient-based clustering algorithm outperformed all other models, including the baseline autoregressive model, during all time periods. Additionally, each model was evaluated on its recursive forecasting performance for 5- and 10-day horizons during each time period. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of regime-aware modeling frameworks and soft clustering approaches in improving volatility forecasting, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty and structural change.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions, particularly in hyperparameter tuning. However, standard BO assumes access to precise objective values, which may be unavailable, noisy, or unreliable in real-world settings where only relative or rank-based feedback can be obtained. In this study, we propose Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization (QS-BO), a principled rank-based optimization framework. QS-BO converts ranks into heteroscedastic Gaussian targets through a quantile-scaling pipeline, enabling the use of Gaussian process surrogates and standard acquisition functions without requiring explicit metric scores. We evaluate QS-BO on synthetic benchmark functions, including one- and two-dimensional nonlinear functions and the Branin function, and compare its performance against Random Search. Results demonstrate that QS-BO consistently achieves lower objective values and exhibits greater stability across runs. Statistical tests further confirm that QS-BO significantly outperforms Random Search at the 1\% significance level. These findings establish QS-BO as a practical and effective extension of Bayesian Optimization for rank-only feedback, with promising applications in preference learning, recommendation, and human-in-the-loop optimization where absolute metric values are unavailable or unreliable.

Abstract: Machine Learning is becoming increasingly more important in today's world. It is therefore very important to provide understanding of the decision-making process of machine-learning models. A popular way to do this is by looking at the Shapley-Values of these models as introduced by Lundberg and Lee.
  In this thesis, we discuss the two main results by Lundberg and Lee from a mathematically rigorous standpoint and provide full proofs, which are not available from the original material.
  The first result of this thesis is an axiomatic characterization of the Shapley values in machine learning based on axioms by Young. We show that the Shapley values are the unique explanation to satisfy local accuracy, missingness, symmetry and consistency. Lundberg and Lee claim that the symmetry axiom is redundant for explanations. However, we provide a counterexample that shows the symmetry axiom is in fact essential.
  The second result shows that we can write the Shapley values as the unique solution to a weighted linear regression problem. This result is proven with the use of dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping. Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically. However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side, server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates, highlighting the limited robustness of state-of-the-art agents.

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset, covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network (EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test). With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics (model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93% test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.

Abstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.

Abstract: We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose attention patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on content. We argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when the underlying token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators from a "calibration text", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such stable heads in the first layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined output by a linear summary of the surrounding text. This approximation enables a procedure where from the weights alone - and a single calibration text - we can uncover hundreds of first layer neurons that respond to high-level contextual properties of the surrounding text, including neurons that didn't activate on the calibration text.

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However, most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing science.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), where adversaries reconstruct private data from shared gradients. Existing defenses either incur impractical computational overhead for embedded platforms or fail to achieve privacy protection and good model utility at the same time. Moreover, many defenses can be easily bypassed by adaptive adversaries who have obtained the defense details. To address these limitations, we propose SVDefense, a novel defense framework against GIAs that leverages the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obfuscate gradient updates. SVDefense introduces three key innovations, a Self-Adaptive Energy Threshold that adapts to client vulnerability, a Channel-Wise Weighted Approximation that selectively preserves essential gradient information for effective model training while enhancing privacy protection, and a Layer-Wise Weighted Aggregation for effective model aggregation under class imbalance. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVDefense outperforms existing defenses across multiple applications, including image classification, human activity recognition, and keyword spotting, by offering robust privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy. Furthermore, SVDefense is practical for deployment on various resource-constrained embedded platforms. We will make our code publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (NNs) for computer vision are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., miniscule malicious changes to inputs may induce unintuitive outputs. One key approach to verify and mitigate such robustness issues is to falsify expected output behavior. This allows, e.g., to locally proof security, or to (re)train NNs on obtained adversarial input examples. Due to the black-box nature of NNs, current attacks only falsify a class of the final output, such as flipping from $\texttt{stop_sign}$ to $\neg\texttt{stop_sign}$. In this short position paper we generalize this to search for generally illogical behavior, as considered in NN verification: falsify constraints (concept-based properties) involving further human-interpretable concepts, like $\texttt{red}\wedge\texttt{octogonal}\rightarrow\texttt{stop_sign}$. For this, an easy implementation of concept-based properties on already trained NNs is proposed using techniques from explainable artificial intelligence. Further, we sketch the theoretical proof that attacks on concept-based properties are expected to have a reduced search space compared to simple class falsification, whilst arguably be more aligned with intuitive robustness targets. As an outlook to this work in progress we hypothesize that this approach has potential to efficiently and simultaneously improve logical compliance and robustness.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection systems.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is critical for timely intervention, yet current diagnostic approaches remain resource-intensive and invasive. Speech, encompassing both acoustic and linguistic dimensions, offers a promising non-invasive biomarker for cognitive decline. In this study, we present a machine learning framework for the PROCESS Challenge, leveraging both audio embeddings and linguistic features derived from spontaneous speech recordings. Audio representations were extracted using Whisper embeddings from the Cookie Theft description task, while linguistic features-spanning pronoun usage, syntactic complexity, filler words, and clause structure-were obtained from transcriptions across Semantic Fluency, Phonemic Fluency, and Cookie Theft picture description. Classification models aimed to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC), MCI, and AD participants, while regression models predicted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Results demonstrated that voted ensemble models trained on concatenated linguistic features achieved the best classification performance (F1 = 0.497), while Whisper embedding-based ensemble regressors yielded the lowest MMSE prediction error (RMSE = 2.843). Comparative evaluation within the PROCESS Challenge placed our models among the top submissions in regression task, and mid-range for classification, highlighting the complementary strengths of linguistic and audio embeddings. These findings reinforce the potential of multimodal speech-based approaches for scalable, non-invasive cognitive assessment and underline the importance of integrating task-specific linguistic and acoustic markers in dementia detection.

Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/mhdfb/sideinfo-search-reconstruction}{this repository}.

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation, embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points, enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness, hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Abstract: The Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) method is a recently proposed class of parameter estimation algorithms that exhibits notable noise robustness and computational efficiency. This work examines the coverage and bias properties of the original WENDy-IRLS algorithm's parameter and state estimators in the context of the following differential equations: Logistic, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark. The estimators' performance was studied in simulated data examples, under four different noise distributions (normal, log-normal, additive censored normal, and additive truncated normal), and a wide range of noise, reaching levels much higher than previously tested for this algorithm.

Abstract: DB engines produce efficient query execution plans by relying on cost models. Practical implementations estimate cardinality of queries using heuristics, with magic numbers tuned to improve average performance on benchmarks. Empirically, estimation error significantly grows with query complexity. Alternatively, learning-based estimators offer improved accuracy, but add operational complexity preventing their adoption in-practice. Recognizing that query workloads contain highly repetitive subquery patterns, we learn many simple regressors online, each localized to a pattern. The regressor corresponding to a pattern can be randomly-accessed using hash of graph structure of the subquery. Our method has negligible overhead and competes with SoTA learning-based approaches on error metrics. Further, amending PostgreSQL with our method achieves notable accuracy and runtime improvements over traditional methods and drastically reduces operational costs compared to other learned cardinality estimators, thereby offering the most practical and efficient solution on the Pareto frontier. Concretely, simulating JOB-lite workload on IMDb speeds-up execution by 7.5 minutes (>30%) while incurring only 37 seconds overhead for online learning.

Abstract: Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ans\"atze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems, relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally, models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others' existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition. We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop appropriate AI self-awareness.

Abstract: We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively. Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and cyber threats.

<title>Composite Optimization with Error Feedback: the Dual Averaging Approach</title>

Abstract: Communication efficiency is a central challenge in distributed machine learning training, and message compression is a widely used solution. However, standard Error Feedback (EF) methods (Seide et al., 2014), though effective for smooth unconstrained optimization with compression (Karimireddy et al., 2019), fail in the broader and practically important setting of composite optimization, which captures, e.g., objectives consisting of a smooth loss combined with a non-smooth regularizer or constraints. The theoretical foundation and behavior of EF in the context of the general composite setting remain largely unexplored. In this work, we consider composite optimization with EF. We point out that the basic EF mechanism and its analysis no longer stand when a composite part is involved. We argue that this is because of a fundamental limitation in the method and its analysis technique. We propose a novel method that combines Dual Averaging with EControl (Gao et al., 2024), a state-of-the-art variant of the EF mechanism, and achieves for the first time a strong convergence analysis for composite optimization with error feedback. Along with our new algorithm, we also provide a new and novel analysis template for inexact dual averaging method, which might be of independent interest. We also provide experimental results to complement our theoretical findings.

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution, which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no additional cost.

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic computational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$. Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated, fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation from quadratic ($O(N^2 \cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \cdot T)$) with respect to the number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline stateless model of comparable size.

<title>Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

<title>Exploring the Hierarchical Reasoning Model for Small Natural-Image Classification Without Augmentation</title>

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches 65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains 77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model may allow it to improve greatly.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts (CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling. We confirm our findings with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research directions.

Abstract: Recently proposed evaluation benchmarks aim to characterize the effective context length and the forgetting tendencies of large language models (LLMs). However, these benchmarks often rely on simplistic 'needle in a haystack' retrieval or continuation tasks that may not accurately reflect the performance of these models in information-dense scenarios. Thus, rather than simple next token prediction, we argue for evaluating these models on more complex reasoning tasks that requires them to induce structured relational knowledge from the text - such as graphs from potentially noisy natural language content. While the input text can be viewed as generated in terms of a graph, its structure is not made explicit and connections must be induced from distributed textual cues, separated by long contexts and interspersed with irrelevant information. Our findings reveal that LLMs begin to exhibit memory drift and contextual forgetting at much shorter effective lengths when tasked with this form of relational reasoning, compared to what existing benchmarks suggest. With these findings, we offer recommendations for the optimal use of popular LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We further show that even models specialized for reasoning, such as OpenAI o1, remain vulnerable to early memory drift in these settings. These results point to significant limitations in the models' ability to abstract structured knowledge from unstructured input and highlight the need for architectural adaptations to improve long-range reasoning.

Abstract: The introduction of machine learning methods has led to significant advances in automation, optimization, and discoveries in various fields of science and technology. However, their widespread application faces a fundamental limitation: the transfer of models between data domains generally lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. The key problem is the lack of formal criteria to guarantee that a model trained on one type of data will retain its properties on another.This paper proposes a solution to this problem by formalizing the concept of analogy between data sets and models using first-order logic and Hoare logic.We formulate and rigorously prove a theorem that sets out the necessary and sufficient conditions for analogy in the task of knowledge transfer between machine learning models. Practical verification of the analogy theorem on model data obtained using the Monte Carlo method, as well as on MNIST and USPS data, allows us to achieving F1 scores of 0.84 and 0.88 for convolutional neural networks and random forests, respectively.The proposed approach not only allows us to justify the correctness of transfer between domains but also provides tools for comparing the applicability of models to different types of data.The main contribution of the work is a rigorous formalization of analogy at the level of program logic, providing verifiable guarantees of the correctness of knowledge transfer, which opens new opportunities for both theoretical research and the practical use of machine learning models in previously inaccessible areas.

Abstract: Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.

Abstract: We introduce EmbodiSwap - a method for producing photorealistic synthetic robot overlays over human video. We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$ trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images. Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information, control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive, editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance.

Abstract: Robots and other intelligent systems navigating in complex dynamic environments should predict future actions and intentions of surrounding agents to reach their goals efficiently and avoid collisions. The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.

Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS. Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 -> 3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716 recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results, with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings. ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the 9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support real-world pediatric ECG applications.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

Abstract: Current Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrated with Digital Twin (DT) technology face critical limitations in achieving real-time performance for mission-critical industrial applications. Existing 5G-enabled systems suffer from latencies exceeding 10ms, which are inadequate for applications requiring sub-millisecond response times, such as autonomous industrial control and predictive maintenance. This research aims to develop and validate a 6G-enabled Digital Twin framework that achieves ultra-low latency communication and real-time synchronization between physical industrial assets and their digital counterparts, specifically targeting bearing fault detection as a critical industrial use case. The proposed framework integrates terahertz communications (0.1-1 THz), intelligent reflecting surfaces, and edge artificial intelligence within a five-layer architecture. Experimental validation was conducted using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, implementing comprehensive feature extraction (15 time and frequency domain features) and Random Forest classification algorithms. The system performance was evaluated against traditional WiFi-6 and 5G networks across multiple metrics, including classification accuracy, end-to-end latency, and scalability. It achieved 97.7% fault classification accuracy with 0.8ms end-to-end latency, representing a 15.6x improvement over WiFi-6 (12.5ms) and 5.25x improvement over 5G (4.2ms) networks. The system demonstrated superior scalability with sub-linear processing time growth and maintained consistent performance across four bearing fault categories (normal, inner race, outer race, and ball faults) with macro-averaged F1-scores exceeding 97%.

<title>Spectral Thresholds for Identifiability and Stability:Finite-Sample Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Learning</title>

Abstract: In high-dimensional learning, models remain stable until they collapse abruptly once the sample size falls below a critical level. This instability is not algorithm-specific but a geometric mechanism: when the weakest Fisher eigendirection falls beneath sample-level fluctuations, identifiability fails. Our Fisher Threshold Theorem formalizes this by proving that stability requires the minimal Fisher eigenvalue to exceed an explicit $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ bound. Unlike prior asymptotic or model-specific criteria, this threshold is finite-sample and necessary, marking a sharp phase transition between reliable concentration and inevitable failure. To make the principle constructive, we introduce the Fisher floor, a verifiable spectral regularization robust to smoothing and preconditioning. Synthetic experiments on Gaussian mixtures and logistic models confirm the predicted transition, consistent with $d/n$ scaling. Statistically, the threshold sharpens classical eigenvalue conditions into a non-asymptotic law; learning-theoretically, it defines a spectral sample-complexity frontier, bridging theory with diagnostics for robust high-dimensional inference.

Abstract: I present a regression algorithm that provides a continuous, piecewise-smooth function approximating scattered data. It is based on composing and blending linear functions over Voronoi cells, and it scales to high dimensions. The algorithm infers Voronoi cells from seed vertices and constructs a linear function for the input data in and around each cell. As the algorithm does not explicitly compute the Voronoi diagram, it avoids the curse of dimensionality. An accuracy of around 98.2% on the MNIST dataset with 722,200 degrees of freedom (without data augmentation, convolution, or other geometric operators) demonstrates the applicability and scalability of the algorithm.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: There are limitations of traditional methods and deep learning methods in terms of interpretability, generalization, and quantification of uncertainty in industrial fault diagnosis, and there are core problems of insufficient credibility in industrial fault diagnosis. The architecture performs preliminary analysis through a Bayesian network-based diagnostic engine and features an LLM-driven cognitive quorum module with multimodal input capabilities. The module conducts expert-level arbitration of initial diagnoses by analyzing structured features and diagnostic charts, prioritizing final decisions after conflicts are identified. To ensure the reliability of the system output, the architecture integrates a confidence calibration module based on temperature calibration and a risk assessment module, which objectively quantifies the reliability of the system using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE). Experimental results on a dataset containing multiple fault types showed that the proposed framework improved diagnostic accuracy by more than 28 percentage points compared to the baseline model, while the calibrated ECE was reduced by more than 75%. Case studies have confirmed that HCAA effectively corrects misjudgments caused by complex feature patterns or knowledge gaps in traditional models, providing novel and practical engineering solutions for building high-trust, explainable AI diagnostic systems for industrial applications.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and other hypothesis testing methodologies.

Abstract: Manually editing pasted code is a long-standing developer pain point. In internal software development at Google, we observe that code is pasted 4 times more often than it is manually typed. These paste actions frequently require follow-up edits, ranging from simple reformatting and renaming to more complex style adjustments and cross-language translations. Prior work has shown deep learning can be used to predict these edits. In this work, we show how to iteratively develop and scale Smart Paste, an IDE feature for post-paste edit suggestions, to Google's development environment. This experience can serve as a guide for AI practitioners on a holistic approach to feature development, covering user experience, system integration, and model capabilities. Since deployment, Smart Paste has had overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 45% acceptance rate. At Google's enterprise scale, these accepted suggestions account substantially for over 1% of all code written company-wide.

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces, motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game structure for improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini, Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4, StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default, LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95 latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs, and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling, and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy. We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive, and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with targeted LLM assistance.

Abstract: Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare, energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete, messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive, intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly detection tasks in IoT

Abstract: Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks.

Abstract: The energy cost of computation has emerged as a central challenge at the intersection of physics and computer science. Recent advances in statistical physics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise characterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in information-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent control protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that minimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we develop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation response relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that optimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both using FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on iteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much easier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing equations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a double-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to construct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The framework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by optimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test, the framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work costs comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide principled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in physical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates robust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic biological networks.

Abstract: We present self-speculative masked diffusions, a new class of masked diffusion generative models for discrete data that require significantly fewer function evaluations to generate samples. Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled, however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We apply our method to GPT2 scale text modelling and protein sequences generation, finding that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security. Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.

Abstract: Personalized AI agents are becoming central to modern information retrieval, yet most evaluation methodologies remain static, relying on fixed benchmarks and one-off metrics that fail to reflect how users' needs evolve over time. These limitations hinder our ability to assess whether agents can meaningfully adapt to individuals across dynamic, longitudinal interactions. In this perspective paper, we propose a conceptual lens for rethinking evaluation in adaptive personalization, shifting the focus from static performance snapshots to interaction-aware, evolving assessments. We organize this lens around three core components: (1) persona-based user simulation with temporally evolving preference models; (2) structured elicitation protocols inspired by reference interviews to extract preferences in context; and (3) adaptation-aware evaluation mechanisms that measure how agent behavior improves across sessions and tasks. While recent works have embraced LLM-driven user simulation, we situate this practice within a broader paradigm for evaluating agents over time. To illustrate our ideas, we conduct a case study in e-commerce search using the PersonalWAB dataset. Beyond presenting a framework, our work lays a conceptual foundation for understanding and evaluating personalization as a continuous, user-centric endeavor.

<title>Keep It on a Leash: Controllable Pseudo-label Generation Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers' tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks under physical limits.

Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities, limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.

Abstract: The growing availability of large and complex datasets has increased interest in temporal stochastic processes that can capture stylized facts such as marginal skewness, non-Gaussian tails, long memory, and even non-Markovian dynamics. While such models are often easy to simulate from, parameter estimation remains challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a promising way forward, but existing methods typically require large training datasets or complex architectures and frequently yield confidence (credible) regions that fail to attain their nominal values, raising doubts on the reliability of estimates for the very features that motivate the use of these models. To address these challenges, we propose a fast and accurate, sample-efficient SBI framework for amortized posterior inference applicable to intractable stochastic processes. The proposed approach relies on two main steps: first, we learn the posterior density by decomposing it sequentially across parameter dimensions. Then, we use Chebyshev polynomial approximations to efficiently generate independent posterior samples, enabling accurate inference even when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods mix poorly. We further develop novel diagnostic tools for SBI in this context, as well as post-hoc calibration techniques; the latter not only lead to performance improvements of the learned inferential tool, but also to the ability to reuse it directly with new time series of varying lengths, thus amortizing the training cost. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on trawl processes, a class of flexible infinitely divisible models that generalize univariate Gaussian processes, applied to energy demand data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods, including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

Abstract: We prove a saturation theorem for linearized shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^d$. For any antipodally quasi-uniform set of centers, if the target function has smoothness $r>\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2}$, then the best $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb S^d)$ approximation cannot converge faster than order $n^{-\frac{d+2k+1}{2d}}$. This lower bound matches existing upper bounds, thereby establishing the exact saturation order $\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2d}$ for such networks. Our results place linearized neural-network approximation firmly within the classical saturation framework and show that, although ReLU$^k$ networks outperform finite elements under equal degrees $k$, this advantage is intrinsically limited.

Abstract: Modern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is \textit{better}, but what is \textit{good enough}. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70\%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22\% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Competitive search is a setting where document publishers modify them to improve their ranking in response to a query. Recently, publishers have increasingly leveraged LLMs to generate and modify competitive content. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Ranker Feedback (RLRF), a framework that trains LLMs using preference datasets derived from ranking competitions. The goal of a publisher (LLM-based) agent is to optimize content for improved ranking while accounting for the strategies of competing agents. We generate the datasets using approaches that do not rely on human-authored data. We show that our proposed agents consistently and substantially outperform previously suggested approaches for LLM-based competitive document modification. We further show that our agents are effective with ranking functions they were not trained for (i.e., out of distribution) and they adapt to strategic opponents. These findings provide support to the significant potential of using reinforcement learning in competitive search.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in information retrieval, underpinning large-scale applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-modal search. Hashing-based methods provide an efficient solution by mapping high-dimensional data into compact binary codes that enable fast similarity computations in Hamming space. Over the past two decades, a substantial body of work has explored learning to hash, where projection and quantisation functions are optimised from data rather than chosen at random.
  This article offers a foundational survey of early learning-based hashing methods, with an emphasis on the core ideas that shaped the field. We review supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches, highlighting how projection functions are designed to generate meaningful embeddings and how quantisation strategies convert these embeddings into binary codes. We also examine extensions to multi-bit and multi-threshold models, as well as early advances in cross-modal retrieval.
  Rather than providing an exhaustive account of the most recent methods, our goal is to introduce the conceptual foundations of learning-based hashing for ANN search. By situating these early models in their historical context, we aim to equip readers with a structured understanding of the principles, trade-offs, and open challenges that continue to inform current research in this area.

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm, culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Autonomous-Distillation/.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation requirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either lack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between utility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play safeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious, each input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate prompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The cloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the real one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a small portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The intermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the targeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device model. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based accelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing computation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and comparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based non-autoregressive (NAR) models have shown strong promise in large language modeling, however, their potential for automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored. We propose Drax, a discrete flow matching framework for ASR that enables efficient parallel decoding. To better align training with inference, we construct an audio-conditioned probability path that guides the model through trajectories resembling likely intermediate inference errors, rather than direct random noise to target transitions. Our theoretical analysis links the generalization gap to divergences between training and inference occupancies, controlled by cumulative velocity errors, thereby motivating our design choice. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach attains recognition accuracy on par with state-of-the-art speech models while offering improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, highlighting discrete flow matching as a promising direction for advancing NAR ASR.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.

Safety is especially challenging in multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments, COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices, indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in LMRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose \textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop \textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a 4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of 68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

<title>MASC: Boosting Autoregressive Image Generation with a Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57% and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable generative modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of infrared (IR) and Raman spectra is essential for molecular identification and structural analysis. Traditional quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102 small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across diverse molecular and material systems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy. The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on the RfMiD test set.

Abstract: Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions. We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.

Abstract: The sample complexity of estimating or maximising an unknown function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is known to be linked to both the effective dimension and the information gain associated with the kernel. While the information gain has an attractive information-theoretic interpretation, the effective dimension typically results in better rates. We introduce a new quantity called the relative information gain, which measures the sensitivity of the information gain with respect to the observation noise. We show that the relative information gain smoothly interpolates between the effective dimension and the information gain, and that the relative information gain has the same growth rate as the effective dimension. In the second half of the paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayesian excess risk bound for Gaussian process regression. The relative information gain arises naturally from the complexity term in this PAC-Bayesian bound. We prove bounds on the relative information gain that depend on the spectral properties of the kernel. When these upper bounds are combined with our excess risk bound, we obtain minimax-optimal rates of convergence.

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers scale transformers by routing tokens to a sparse subset of feed-forward experts. Token-level routing, however, assigns an entire semantic spectrum to each expert, creating capacity bottlenecks, load-balancing pathologies, and limited specialization. We introduce SliceMoE, an architecture that routes contiguous slices of a token's hidden vector. A d-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a lightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their assigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining per-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave within an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level capacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels. Experiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three text-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference than dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched token-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over syntactic versus semantic subspaces.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from user opinions across various domains. However, performing sentiment analysis in Persian remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled datasets, limited preprocessing tools, and the lack of high-quality embeddings and feature extraction methods. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for Persian aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In particular, we utilize polarity scores from multilingual BERT as additional features and incorporate them into a decision tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 93.34%-surpassing existing benchmarks on the Pars-ABSA dataset. Additionally, we introduce a Persian synonym and entity dictionary, a novel linguistic resource that supports text augmentation through synonym and named entity replacement. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid modeling and feature augmentation in advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages such as Persian.

Abstract: Large language model multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) offer a promising paradigm for harnessing collective intelligence to achieve more advanced forms of AI behaviour. While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions. We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and benchmarks.

Abstract: Traditional conformal prediction methods construct prediction sets such that the true label falls within the set with a user-specified coverage level. However, poorly chosen coverage levels can result in uninformative predictions, either producing overly conservative sets when the coverage level is too high, or empty sets when it is too low. Moreover, the fixed coverage level cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of each individual example, limiting the flexibility and efficiency of these methods. In this work, we leverage recent advances in e-values and post-hoc conformal inference, which allow the use of data-dependent coverage levels while maintaining valid statistical guarantees. We propose to optimize an adaptive coverage policy by training a neural network using a leave-one-out procedure on the calibration set, allowing the coverage level and the resulting prediction set size to vary with the difficulty of each individual example. We support our approach with theoretical coverage guarantees and demonstrate its practical benefits through a series of experiments.

Abstract: Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers underpin modern quantitative finance, governing option pricing and risk evaluation. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However they remain computationally expensive due to their iterative gradient descent based optimization and scale poorly with increasing model size. This paper introduces Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) as fast alternative to PINNs for solving both forward and inverse problems in financial PDEs. PIELMs replace iterative optimization with a single least-squares solve, enabling deterministic and efficient training. We benchmark PIELM on the Black-Scholes and Heston-Hull-White models for forward pricing and demonstrate its capability in inverse model calibration to recover volatility and interest rate parameters from noisy data. From experiments we observe that PIELM achieve accuracy comparable to PINNs while being up to $30\times$ faster, highlighting their potential for real-time financial modeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural instrument sound synthesis using a two-stage semi-supervised learning framework capable of generating pitch-accurate, high-quality music samples from an expressive timbre latent space. Existing approaches that achieve sufficient quality for music production often rely on high-dimensional latent representations that are difficult to navigate and provide unintuitive user experiences. We address this limitation through a two-stage training paradigm: first, we train a pitch-timbre disentangled 2D representation of audio samples using a Variational Autoencoder; second, we use this representation as conditioning input for a Transformer-based generative model. The learned 2D latent space serves as an intuitive interface for navigating and exploring the sound landscape. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns a disentangled timbre space, enabling expressive and controllable audio generation with reliable pitch conditioning. Experimental results show the model's ability to capture subtle variations in timbre while maintaining a high degree of pitch accuracy. The usability of our method is demonstrated in an interactive web application, highlighting its potential as a step towards future music production environments that are both intuitive and creatively empowering: https://pgesam.faresschulz.com

Abstract: Indoor LoRaWAN propagation is shaped by structural and time-varying context factors, which challenge log-distance models and the assumption of log-normal shadowing. We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07 to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7 to 27.9 dB for linear baselines. This result presents a deployment-ready, interpretable workflow with calibrated reliability control for indoor Internet of Things planning, aligned with 6G targets.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of workflows and methods for software engineering using AI emphasizes the need for a systematic evaluation and analysis of their ability to leverage information from entire projects, particularly in large code bases. In this challenge on optimization of context collection for code completion, organized by JetBrains in collaboration with Mistral AI as part of the ASE 2025 conference, participants developed efficient mechanisms for collecting context from source code repositories to improve fill-in-the-middle code completions for Python and Kotlin. We constructed a large dataset of real-world code in these two programming languages using permissively licensed open-source projects. The submissions were evaluated based on their ability to maximize completion quality for multiple state-of-the-art neural models using the chrF metric. During the public phase of the competition, nineteen teams submitted solutions to the Python track and eight teams submitted solutions to the Kotlin track. In the private phase, six teams competed, of which five submitted papers to the workshop.

Abstract: In this paper, for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unbounded state spaces we present refined upper bounds presented in [Kara et. al. JMLR'23] on finite model approximation errors via optimizing the quantizers used for finite model approximations. We also consider implications on quantizer design for quantized Q-learning and empirical model learning, and the performance of policies obtained via Q-learning where the quantized state is treated as the state itself. We highlight the distinctions between planning, where approximating MDPs can be independently designed, and learning (either via Q-learning or empirical model learning), where approximating MDPs are restricted to be defined by invariant measures of Markov chains under exploration policies, leading to significant subtleties on quantizer design performance, even though asymptotic near optimality can be established under both setups. In particular, under Lyapunov growth conditions, we obtain explicit upper bounds which decay to zero as the number of bins approaches infinity.

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing approaches.

<title>Improving Consistency in Retrieval-Augmented Systems with Group Similarity Rewards</title>

Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users expect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries. However, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to variability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and reliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the requirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically equivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that decomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and end-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve consistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization (PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased set to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve Information Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce consistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to retrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase sets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation method that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale training. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA benchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and accuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth supervision. Our work provides practical solutions for evaluating and building reliable RAG systems for safety-critical deployments.

Abstract: Text editing can involve several iterations of revision. Incorporating an efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality. This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET) for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool usability. We release our dataset and code at: https://github.com/ankitvad/PEET_Scorer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at https://github.com/Buyun-Liang/SECA.

Abstract: As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit, utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve learnability.

<title>Modular and Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Sequential Models via Residual Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. However, existing methods treat the entire modeling process as a black box, overlooking opportunities to exploit modular structure. We introduce a conformal prediction framework for two-stage sequential models, where an upstream predictor generates intermediate representations for a downstream model. By decomposing the overall prediction residual into stage-specific components, our method enables practitioners to attribute uncertainty to specific pipeline stages. We develop a risk-controlled parameter selection procedure using family-wise error rate (FWER) control to calibrate stage-wise scaling parameters, and propose an adaptive extension for non-stationary settings that preserves long-run coverage guarantees. Experiments on synthetic distribution shifts, as well as real-world supply chain and stock market data, demonstrate that our approach maintains coverage under conditions that degrade standard conformal methods, while providing interpretable stage-wise uncertainty attribution. This framework offers diagnostic advantages and robust coverage that standard conformal methods lack.

<title>Scale-Invariant Regret Matching and Online Learning with Optimal Convergence: Bridging Theory and Practice in Zero-Sum Games</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04407</link>

arXiv:2510.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A considerable chasm has been looming for decades between theory and practice in zero-sum game solving through first-order methods. Although a convergence rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can exhibit slower $\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play.
  In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ (i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive* learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\ell_2$-)norm of the regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate -- can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.
  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the time until an event occurs. Although it is applied across a wide range of fields, adjusting for reporting delays under practical constraints remains a significant challenge in the insurance industry. Such delays render event occurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring. This issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly enrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our study addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard functions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability distribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We construct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to compute its estimates. Using these findings, we propose a two-stage estimation procedure based on a parametric proportional hazards model to evaluate observations subject to administrative censoring. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the timeliness of risk evaluation for newly enrolled cohorts.

Abstract: We present spd-metrics-id, a Python package for computing distances and divergences between symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. Unlike traditional toolkits that focus on specific applications, spd-metrics-id provides a unified, extensible, and reproducible framework for SPD distance computation. The package supports a wide variety of geometry-aware metrics, including Alpha-z Bures-Wasserstein, Alpha-Procrustes, affine-invariant Riemannian, log-Euclidean, and others, and is accessible both via a command-line interface and a Python API. Reproducibility is ensured through Docker images and Zenodo archiving. We illustrate usage through a connectome fingerprinting example, but the package is broadly applicable to covariance analysis, diffusion tensor imaging, and other domains requiring SPD matrix comparison. The package is openly available at https://pypi.org/project/spd-metrics-id/.

Abstract: This work aims to solve a stochastic nonconvex nonsmooth composite optimization problem. Previous works on composite optimization problem requires the major part to satisfy Lipschitz smoothness or some relaxed smoothness conditions, which excludes some machine learning examples such as regularized ReLU network and sparse support matrix machine. In this work, we focus on stochastic nonconvex composite optimization problem without any smoothness assumptions. In particular, we propose two new notions of approximate stationary points for such optimization problem and obtain finite-time convergence results of two zeroth-order algorithms to these two approximate stationary points respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that these algorithms are effective using numerical experiments.

Abstract: In mixed-integer linear programming, data-driven inverse optimization that learns the objective function and the constraints from observed data plays an important role in constructing appropriate mathematical models for various fields, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known method for learning both the objective functions and the constraints. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for a class of problems where the objective function is expressed as a linear combination of functions and the constraints are represented by functions and thresholds. Specifically, our method first learns the constraints and then learns the objective function. On the theoretical side, we show the proposed method can solve inverse optimization problems in finite dataset, develop statistical learning theory in pseudometric spaces and sub-Gaussian distributions, and construct a statistical learning for inverse optimization. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method is practically applicable for scheduling problems formulated as integer linear programmings with up to 100 decision variables, which are typical in real-world settings.

Unlike prior surveys on this topic, our focus is on giving a self-contained presentation of all known alternative constructions of Eldan's stochastic localization, with an emphasis on connections between different constructions. Our hope is that by collecting these perspectives, some of which had primarily arisen within a particular community (e.g., probability theory, theoretical computer science, information theory, or machine learning), we can broaden the accessibility of stochastic localization, and ease its future use.

Abstract: Physics-based atmosphere-land models with prescribed sea surface temperature have notable successes but also biases in their ability to represent atmospheric variability compared to observations. Recently, AI emulators and hybrid models have emerged with the potential to overcome these biases, but still require systematic evaluation against metrics grounded in fundamental atmospheric dynamics. Here, we evaluate the representation of four atmospheric variability benchmarking metrics in a fully data-driven AI emulator (ACE2-ERA5) and hybrid model (NeuralGCM). The hybrid model and emulator can capture the spectra of large-scale tropical waves and extratropical eddy-mean flow interactions, including critical levels. However, both struggle to capture the timescales associated with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO, $\sim 28$ months) and Southern annular mode propagation ($\sim 150$ days). These dynamical metrics serve as an initial benchmarking tool to inform AI model development and understand their limitations, which may be essential for out-of-distribution applications (e.g., extrapolating to unseen climates).

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity, they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment. Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$ on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed. Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large, pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group, shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a 1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\% performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers are fundamental to engineering simulation. Classical mesh-based approaches (finite difference/volume/element) are fast and accurate on high-quality meshes but struggle with higher-order operators and complex, hard-to-mesh geometries. Recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants are mesh-free and flexible, yet compute-intensive and often less accurate. This paper systematically benchmarks RBF-PIELM, a rapid PINN variant-an extreme learning machine with radial-basis activations-for higher-order PDEs. RBF-PIELM replaces PINNs' time-consuming gradient descent with a single-shot least-squares solve. We test RBF-PIELM on the fourth-order biharmonic equation using two benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flow (streamfunction formulation) and a manufactured oscillatory solution. Our results show up to $(350\times)$ faster training than PINNs and over $(10\times)$ fewer parameters for comparable solution accuracy. Despite surpassing PINNs, RBF-PIELM still lags mature mesh-based solvers and its accuracy degrades on highly oscillatory solutions, highlighting remaining challenges for practical deployment.

<title>Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Popularity Debiasing in Top-K Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.

Abstract: Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities, becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable witness-based persistent homology pipeline for full-brain MRI volumes that couples density-aware landmark selection with a GPU-ready witness filtration. Candidates are scored by a hybrid metric that balances geometric coverage against inverse kernel density, yielding landmark sets that shrink mean pairwise distances by 30-60% over random or density-only baselines while preserving topological features. Benchmarks on BrainWeb, IXI, and synthetic manifolds execute in under ten seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of Cech, Vietoris-Rips, and alpha filtrations. The package is distributed on PyPI as whale-tda (installable via pip); source and issues are hosted at https://github.com/jorgeLRW/whale. The release also exposes a fast preset (mri_deep_dive_fast) for exploratory sweeps, and ships with reproducibility-focused scripts and artifacts for drop-in use in medical imaging workflows.

Abstract: In a dynamic landscape where portfolios and environments evolve, maintaining the accuracy of pricing models is critical. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine concept drift in non-life insurance pricing. We (i) provide an overview of the relevant literature and commonly used methodologies, clarify the distinction between virtual drift and concept drift, and explain their implications for long-run model performance; (ii) review and formalize common performance measures, including the Gini index and deviance loss, and articulate their interpretation; (iii) derive the asymptotic distribution of the Gini index, enabling valid inference and hypothesis testing; and (iv) present a standardized monitoring procedure that indicates when refitting is warranted. We illustrate the framework using a modified real-world portfolio with induced concept drift and discuss practical considerations and pitfalls.

<title>COSMIR: Chain Orchestrated Structured Memory for Iterative Reasoning over Long Context</title>

Abstract: Reasoning over very long inputs remains difficult for large language models (LLMs). Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking missed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage multiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents, CoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and amplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured Memory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc messages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query into concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a fixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared memory. A Manager agent then Synthesizes the final answer directly from the memory. This preserves step-wise read-then-reason benefits while changing both the communication medium (structured memory) and the worker procedure (fixed micro-cycle), yielding higher faithfulness, better long-range aggregation, and auditability. On long-context QA from the HELMET suite, COSMIR reduces propagation-stage information loss and improves accuracy over a CoA baseline.

Abstract: While language models (LMs) paired with residual vector quantization (RVQ) tokenizers have shown promise in text-to-audio (T2A) generation, they still lag behind diffusion-based models by a non-trivial margin. We identify a critical dilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio reconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional LMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key limitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective LMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ layers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these insights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple isolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren outperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving state-of-the-art results. By bridging the representational strengths of LMs with the fidelity demands of audio synthesis, our approach repositions LMs as competitive contenders against diffusion models in T2A tasks. Moreover, by aligning audio representations with linguistic structures, Siren facilitates a promising pathway toward unified multi-modal generation frameworks.

Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven PID controller design based on the principle of adaptive gain optimization, leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) generated for predictive modeling purposes. The proposed control design method utilizes gradients of the PID gain optimization, achieved through the automatic differentiation of PINNs, to apply model predictive control using a cost function based on tracking error and control inputs. By optimizing PINNs-based PID gains, the method achieves adaptive gain tuning that ensures stability while accounting for system nonlinearities. The proposed method features a systematic framework for integrating PINNs-based models of dynamical control systems into closed-loop control systems, enabling direct application to PID control design. A series of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from the control perspectives based on both time and frequency domains.

Abstract: Wasserstein barycenters provide a powerful tool for aggregating probability measures, while leveraging the geometry of their ambient space. Existing discrete methods suffer from poor scalability, as they require access to the complete set of samples from input measures. We address this issue by recasting the original barycenter problem as a gradient flow in the Wasserstein space. Our approach offers two advantages. First, we achieve scalability by sampling mini-batches from the input measures. Second, we incorporate functionals over probability measures, which regularize the barycenter problem through internal, potential, and interaction energies. We present two algorithms for empirical and Gaussian mixture measures, providing convergence guarantees under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. Experimental validation on toy datasets and domain adaptation benchmarks show that our methods outperform previous discrete and neural net-based methods for computing Wasserstein barycenters.

<title>A Case for Declarative LLM-friendly Interfaces for Improved Efficiency of Computer-Use Agents</title>

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to automating computer tasks, yet they struggle with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls.
  We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs. Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism). GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs).
  We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows. Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%. Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making model where a set of items is repeatedly matched to the same set of agents over multiple rounds. The objective is to determine a sequence of matchings that either maximizes the utility of the least advantaged agent at the end of all rounds (optimal) or at the end of every individual round (anytime optimal). We investigate the computational challenges associated with finding (anytime) optimal outcomes and demonstrate that these problems are generally computationally intractable. However, we provide approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and identify several special cases whereby the problem(s) can be solved efficiently. Along the way, we also establish characterizations of Pareto-optimal/maximum matchings, which may be of independent interest to works in matching theory and house allocation.

<title>Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study</title>

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

Abstract: Music Emotion Recognition (MER) is a task deeply connected to human perception, relying heavily on subjective annotations collected from contributors. Prior studies tend to focus on specific musical styles rather than incorporating a diverse range of genres, such as rock and classical, within a single framework. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing emotion from audio content by investigating five datasets with dimensional emotion annotations -- EmoMusic, DEAM, PMEmo, WTC, and WCMED -- which span various musical styles. We demonstrate the problem of out-of-distribution generalization in a systematic experiment. By closely looking at multiple data and feature sets, we provide insight into genre-emotion relationships in existing data and examine potential genre dominance and dataset biases in certain feature representations. Based on these experiments, we arrive at a simple yet effective framework that combines embeddings extracted from the Jukebox model with chroma features and demonstrate how, alongside a combination of several diverse training sets, this permits us to train models with substantially improved cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained, state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025 competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: This article proposes predictive economics as a distinct analytical perspective within economics, grounded in machine learning and centred on predictive accuracy rather than causal identification. Drawing on the instrumentalist tradition (Friedman), the explanation-prediction divide (Shmueli), and the contrast between modelling cultures (Breiman), we formalise prediction as a valid epistemological and methodological objective. Reviewing recent applications across economic subfields, we show how predictive models contribute to empirical analysis, particularly in complex or data-rich contexts. This perspective complements existing approaches and supports a more pluralistic methodology - one that values out-of-sample performance alongside interpretability and theoretical structure.

Abstract: We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2% of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original, while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.

Abstract: A generic D-dimensional Gaussian can be conditioned or projected onto the D-1 unit sphere, thereby leading to the well-known Fisher-Bingham (FB) or Angular Gaussian (AG) distribution families, respectively. These are some of the most fundamental distributions on the sphere, yet cannot straightforwardly be written as a normalizing flow except in two special cases: the von-Mises Fisher in D=3 and the central angular Gaussian in any D. In this paper, we describe how to generalize these special cases to a family of normalizing flows that behave similarly to the full FB or AG family in any D. We call them "zoom-linear-project" (ZLP)-Fisher flows. Unlike a normal Fisher-Bingham distribution, their composition allows to gradually add complexity as needed. Furthermore, they can naturally handle conditional density estimation with target distributions that vary by orders of magnitude in scale - a setting that is important in astronomical applications but that existing flows often struggle with. A particularly useful member of the new family is the Kent analogue that can cheaply upgrade any flow in this situation to yield better performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data, the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate high-dimensional kernel ridge regression (KRR) on i.i.d. Gaussian data with anisotropic power-law covariance. This setting differs fundamentally from the classical source & capacity conditions for KRR, where power-law assumptions are typically imposed on the kernel eigen-spectrum itself. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive an explicit characterization of the kernel spectrum for polynomial inner-product kernels, giving a precise description of how the kernel eigen-spectrum inherits the data decay. Second, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the excess risk in the high-dimensional regime for a particular kernel with this spectral behavior, showing that the sample complexity is governed by the effective dimension of the data rather than the ambient dimension. These results establish a fundamental advantage of learning with power-law anisotropic data over isotropic data. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous treatment of non-linear KRR under power-law data.

Abstract: Understanding signal behavior across scales is vital in areas such as natural phenomena analysis and financial modeling. A key property is self-similarity, quantified by the Hurst exponent (H), which reveals long-term dependencies. Wavelet-based methods are effective for estimating H due to their multi-scale analysis capability, but additive noise in real-world measurements often degrades accuracy. We propose Noise-Controlled ALPHEE (NC-ALPHEE), an enhancement of the Average Level-Pairwise Hurst Exponent Estimator (ALPHEE), incorporating noise mitigation and generating multiple level-pairwise estimates from signal energy pairs. A neural network (NN) combines these estimates, replacing traditional averaging. This adaptive learning maintains ALPHEE's behavior in noise-free cases while improving performance in noisy conditions. Extensive simulations show that in noise-free data, NC-ALPHEE matches ALPHEE's accuracy using both averaging and NN-based methods. Under noise, however, traditional averaging deteriorates and requires impractical level restrictions, while NC-ALPHEE consistently outperforms existing techniques without such constraints. NC-ALPHEE offers a robust, adaptive approach for H estimation, significantly enhancing the reliability of wavelet-based methods in noisy environments.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior. AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods. Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving 63% memory cost.

Abstract: We introduce LEGOMem, a modular procedural memory framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems in workflow automation. LEGOMem decomposes past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved, and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory design in multi-agent workflow automation.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques: early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other contexts.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes, which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed, multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes.

Abstract: Prompt injection poses a serious threat to the reliability and safety of LLM agents. Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contexts where their failures can have direct sociopolitical consequences. Yet, existing safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as 97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts, and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA, and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/psyonp/SocialHarmBench.

Abstract: Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

Abstract: In Kigali, Rwanda, motorcycle taxis are a primary mode of transportation, often navigating unpredictably and disregarding traffic rules, posing significant challenges for autonomous driving systems. This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.

Abstract: Set-valued classification is used in multiclass settings where confusion between classes can occur and lead to misleading predictions. However, its application may amplify discriminatory bias motivating the development of set-valued approaches under fairness constraints. In this paper, we address the problem of set-valued classification under demographic parity and expected size constraints. We propose two complementary strategies: an oracle-based method that minimizes classification risk while satisfying both constraints, and a computationally efficient proxy that prioritizes constraint satisfaction. For both strategies, we derive closed-form expressions for the (optimal) fair set-valued classifiers and use these to build plug-in, data-driven procedures for empirical predictions. We establish distribution-free convergence rates for violations of the size and fairness constraints for both methods, and under mild assumptions we also provide excess-risk bounds for the oracle-based approach. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of both strategies and highlight the efficiency of our proxy method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement. Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance, enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral, Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

<title>Embracing Discrete Search: A Reasonable Approach to Causal Structure Learning</title>

Abstract: We present FLOP (Fast Learning of Order and Parents), a score-based causal discovery algorithm for linear models. It pairs fast parent selection with iterative Cholesky-based score updates, cutting run-times over prior algorithms. This makes it feasible to fully embrace discrete search, enabling iterated local search with principled order initialization to find graphs with scores at or close to the global optimum. The resulting structures are highly accurate across benchmarks, with near-perfect recovery in standard settings. This performance calls for revisiting discrete search over graphs as a reasonable approach to causal discovery.

<title>Pivotal CLTs for Pseudolikelihood via Conditional Centering in Dependent Random Fields</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study fluctuations of conditionally centered statistics of the form $$N^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(g(\sigma_i)-\mathbb{E}_N[g(\sigma_i)|\sigma_j,j\neq i])$$ where $(\sigma_1,\ldots ,\sigma_N)$ are sampled from a dependent random field, and $g$ is some bounded function. Our first main result shows that under weak smoothness assumptions on the conditional means (which cover both sparse and dense interactions), the above statistic converges to a Gaussian \emph{scale mixture} with a random scale determined by a \emph{quadratic variance} and an \emph{interaction component}. We also show that under appropriate studentization, the limit becomes a pivotal Gaussian. We leverage this theory to develop a general asymptotic framework for maximum pseudolikelihood (MPLE) inference in dependent random fields. We apply our results to Ising models with pairwise as well as higher-order interactions and exponential random graph models (ERGMs). In particular, we obtain a joint central limit theorem for the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters via the joint MPLE (to our knowledge, the first such result in dense, irregular regimes), and we derive conditionally centered edge CLTs and marginal MPLE CLTs for ERGMs without restricting to the ``sub-critical" region. Our proof is based on a method of moments approach via combinatorial decision-tree pruning, which may be of independent interest.

<title>AWARE, Beyond Sentence Boundaries: A Contextual Transformer Framework for Identifying Cultural Capital in STEM Narratives</title>

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the context of the narrative.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.

<title>Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding</title>

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obtain categorical proofs and generalizations of existing results on causal abstractions. Using string diagrammatical tools, we can explicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a low-level graph under interventions. We discuss how methods from mechanistic interpretability, such as circuit analysis and sparse autoencoders, fit within our categorical framework. We also show how applying do-calculus on a high-level graphical abstraction of an acyclic-directed mixed graph (ADMG), when unobserved confounders are present, gives valid results on the low-level graph, thus generalizing an earlier statement by Anand et al. (2023). We argue that our framework is more suitable for modeling causal abstractions compared to existing categorical frameworks. Finally, we discuss how notions such as $\tau$-consistency and constructive $\tau$-abstractions can be recovered with our framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new mathematical optimization model for multiclass classification based on arrangements of hyperplanes. Our approach preserves the core support vector machine (SVM) paradigm of maximizing class separation while minimizing misclassification errors, and it is computationally more efficient than a previous formulation. We present a kernel-based extension that allows it to construct nonlinear decision boundaries. Furthermore, we show how the framework can naturally incorporate alternative geometric structures, including classification trees, $\ell_p$-SVMs, and models with discrete feature selection. To address large-scale instances, we develop a dynamic clustering matheuristic that leverages the proposed MIP formulation. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and dynamic clustering heuristic, and we report competitive classification performance on both synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comparing our method with state-of-the-art implementations available in scikit-learn.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

Abstract: We study the process-level dynamics of Thompson sampling in the ``small gap'' regime. The small gap regime is one in which the gaps between the arm means are of order $\sqrt{\gamma}$ or smaller and the time horizon is of order $1/\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is small. As $\gamma \downarrow 0$, we show that the process-level dynamics of Thompson sampling converge weakly to the solutions to certain stochastic differential equations and stochastic ordinary differential equations. Our weak convergence theory is developed from first principles using the Continuous Mapping Theorem, can handle stationary, weakly dependent reward processes, and can also be adapted to analyze a variety of sampling-based bandit algorithms. Indeed, we show that the process-level dynamics of many sampling-based bandit algorithms -- including Thompson sampling designed for any single-parameter exponential family of rewards, as well as non-parametric bandit algorithms based on bootstrap re-sampling -- satisfy an invariance principle. Namely, their weak limits coincide with that of Gaussian parametric Thompson sampling with Gaussian priors. Moreover, in the small gap regime, the regret performance of these algorithms is generally insensitive to model mis-specification, changing continuously with increasing degrees of mis-specification.

Abstract: Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool and is often deployed in settings which repeatedly solve similar instances of the same problem. Amortized optimization methods use learning to predict the solutions to problems in these settings, exploiting the shared structure between similar problem instances. These methods have been crucial in variational inference and reinforcement learning and are capable of solving optimization problems many orders of magnitudes faster than traditional optimization methods that do not use amortization. This tutorial presents an introduction to the amortized optimization foundations behind these advancements and overviews their applications in variational inference, sparse coding, gradient-based meta-learning, control, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, optimal transport, and deep equilibrium networks. The source code for this tutorial is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/amortized-optimization-tutorial.

Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the convex conjugate (also known as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate or c-transform) that appears in Euclidean Wasserstein-2 optimal transport. This conjugation is considered difficult to compute and in practice, methods are limited by not being able to exactly conjugate the dual potentials in continuous space. To overcome this, the computation of the conjugate can be approximated with amortized optimization, which learns a model to predict the conjugate. I show that combining amortized approximations to the conjugate with a solver for fine-tuning significantly improves the quality of transport maps learned for the Wasserstein-2 benchmark by Korotin et al. (2021a) and is able to model many 2-dimensional couplings and flows considered in the literature.

Abstract: Self-attributing neural networks (SANNs) present a potential path towards interpretable models for high-dimensional problems, but often face significant trade-offs in performance. In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision. SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery. Our code is available at https://github.com/BrachioLab/sop

Abstract: LiNGAM determines the variable order from cause to effect using additive noise models, but it faces challenges with confounding. Previous methods maintained LiNGAM's fundamental structure while trying to identify and address variables affected by confounding. As a result, these methods required significant computational resources regardless of the presence of confounding, and they did not ensure the detection of all confounding types. In contrast, this paper enhances LiNGAM by introducing LiNGAM-MMI, a method that quantifies the magnitude of confounding using KL divergence and arranges the variables to minimize its impact. This method efficiently achieves a globally optimal variable order through the shortest path problem formulation. LiNGAM-MMI processes data as efficiently as traditional LiNGAM in scenarios without confounding while effectively addressing confounding situations. Our experimental results suggest that LiNGAM-MMI more accurately determines the correct variable order, both in the presence and absence of confounding.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), while a breakthrough in decentralized machine learning, contends with significant challenges such as limited data availability and the variability of computational resources, which can stifle the performance and scalability of the models. The integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL presents a compelling solution to these issues, with the potential to enhance data richness and reduce computational demands through pre-training and data augmentation. However, this incorporation introduces novel issues in terms of robustness, privacy, and fairness, which have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing research. We make a preliminary investigation into this field by systematically evaluating the implications of FM-FL integration across these dimensions. We analyze the trade-offs involved, uncover the threats and issues introduced by this integration, and propose a set of criteria and strategies for navigating these challenges. Furthermore, we identify potential research directions for advancing this field, laying a foundation for future development in creating reliable, secure, and equitable FL systems.

Abstract: Tabular data represent one of the most prevalent data formats in applied machine learning, largely because they accommodate a broad spectrum of real-world problems. Existing literature has studied many of the shortcomings of neural architectures on tabular data and has repeatedly confirmed the scalability and robustness of gradient-boosted decision trees across varied datasets. However, recent deep learning models have not been subjected to a comprehensive evaluation under conditions that allow for a fair comparison with existing classical approaches. This situation motivates an investigation into whether recent deep-learning paradigms outperform classical ML methods on tabular data. Our survey fills this gap by benchmarking seventeen state-of-the-art methods, spanning neural networks, classical ML and AutoML techniques. Our empirical results over 68 diverse datasets from a well-established benchmark indicate a paradigm shift, where Deep Learning methods outperform classical approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based methods for constructing solutions to combinatorial optimization problems are rapidly approaching the performance of human-designed algorithms. To further narrow the gap, learning-based approaches must efficiently explore the solution space during the search process. Recent approaches artificially increase exploration by enforcing diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules, however, these rules can impair solution quality and are difficult to design for more complex problems. In this paper, we introduce PolyNet, an approach for improving exploration of the solution space by learning complementary solution strategies. In contrast to other works, PolyNet uses only a single-decoder and a training schema that does not enforce diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules. We evaluate PolyNet on four combinatorial optimization problems and observe that the implicit diversity mechanism allows PolyNet to find better solutions than approaches that explicitly enforce diverse solution generation.

Abstract: What is intelligence? We argue for a structural-dynamical account rooted in a topological closure law: \emph{the boundary of a boundary vanishes} ($\partial^2=0$). This principle forces transient fragments to cancel while closed cycles persist as invariants, yielding the cascade $\partial^2\!=\!0 \Rightarrow \text{cycles (invariants)} \Rightarrow \text{memory} \Rightarrow \text{prediction (intelligence)}$. Prediction requires invariance: only order-invariant cycles can stabilize the predictive substrate. This motivates the \textbf{Structure-before-Specificity (SbS)} principle, where persistent structures ($\Phi$) must stabilize before contextual specificities ($\Psi$) can be meaningfully interpreted, and is formalized by the \textbf{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP)}, which casts cognition as dynamic alignment that minimizes the joint uncertainty $H(\Phi,\Psi)$. We show that \textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)} is the computational mechanism that implements SbS\,$\rightarrow$\,CCUP through dual bootstrapping: \emph{temporal} bootstrapping consolidates episodic specifics into reusable latent trajectories, while \emph{spatial} bootstrapping reuses these invariants across latent manifolds. This framework explains why \emph{semantics precedes syntax}: stable cycles anchor meaning, and symbolic syntax emerges only after semantic invariants are in place. In an evolutionary perspective, the same closure law unifies the trajectory of natural intelligence: from primitive memory traces in microbes, to cyclic sensorimotor patterns in bilaterians, to semantic generalization in mammals, culminating in human symbolic abstraction by natural language. In sum, intelligence arises from the progressive collapse of specificity into structure, grounded in the closure-induced emergence of invariants.

Abstract: Convergence of Q-learning has been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades. Recently, an asymptotic convergence analysis for Q-learning was introduced using a switching system framework. This approach applies the so-called ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach to prove the convergence of the asynchronous Q-learning modeled as a continuous-time switching system, where notions from switching system theory are used to prove its asymptotic stability without using explicit Lyapunov arguments. However, to prove stability, restrictive conditions, such as quasi-monotonicity, must be satisfied for the underlying switching systems, which makes it hard to easily generalize the analysis method to other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the smooth Q-learning variants. In this paper, we present a more general and unified convergence analysis that improves upon the switching system approach and can analyze Q-learning and its smooth variants. The proposed analysis is motivated by previous work on the convergence of synchronous Q-learning based on $p$-norm serving as a Lyapunov function. However, the proposed analysis addresses more general ODE models that can cover both asynchronous Q-learning and its smooth versions with simpler frameworks.

Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we first estimate the underlying velocity field and use the Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating discrete approximations of the characteristics. A deep neural network is then trained to fit these characteristics, creating a one-step map that pushes a simple Gaussian distribution to the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the errors arising from velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate in the 2-Wasserstein distance under mild data assumptions. Crucially, we demonstrate that under a standard manifold assumption, this convergence rate depends only on the intrinsic dimension of data rather than the much larger ambient dimension, proving our model's ability to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous convergence analysis for a flow-based one-step generative model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high-quality and high-resolution sample generation with the efficiency of just a single neural network evaluation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) was recently proposed to securely train models with data held over multiple locations (``clients'') under the coordination of a central server. Prolonged training times caused by slow clients may hinder the performance of FL; while asynchronous communication is a promising solution, highly heterogeneous client response times under non-IID local data may introduce significant bias to the global model, particularly in client-driven setups where sampling is infeasible. To address this issue, we propose \underline{A}synch\underline{R}onous \underline{E}xact \underline{A}veraging (\textsc{AREA}), a stochastic (sub)gradient method that leverages asynchrony for scalability and uses client-side memory to correct the bias induced by uneven participation, without client sampling or prior knowledge of client latencies. \textsc{AREA} communicates model residuals rather than gradient estimates, reducing exposure to gradient inversion, and is compatible with secure aggregation. Under standard assumptions and unbounded, heterogeneous delays with finite mean, AREA achieves optimal convergence rates: $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ in the strongly convex, smooth regime and $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ in the convex, nonsmooth regime. For strongly convex, smooth objectives, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that AREA accommodates larger step sizes than existing methods, enabling fast convergence without adversely impacting model generalization. In the convex, nonsmooth setting, to our knowledge we are the first to obtain rates that scale with the average client update frequency rather than the minimum or maximum, indicating increased robustness to outliers.

<title>Federated Continual Learning Goes Online: Uncertainty-Aware Memory Management for Vision Tasks and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Given the ability to model more realistic and dynamic problems, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has been increasingly investigated recently. A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to deal with different modalities in the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach. Specifically, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and - by retraining the model on such samples - we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings while maintaining data confidentiality and competitive communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Backpropagation, a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is widely considered biologically implausible, because it relies on precise symmetry between feedforward and feedback weights to accurately propagate gradient signals that assign credit. The so-called weight transport problem concerns how biological brains learn to align feedforward and feedback paths while avoiding the non-biological transport of feedforward weights into feedback weights. To address this, several credit assignment algorithms, such as feedback alignment and the Kollen-Pollack rule, have been proposed. While they can achieve the desired weight alignment, these algorithms imply that if a neuron sends a feedforward synapse to another neuron, it should also receive an identical or at least partially correlated feedback synapse from the latter neuron, thereby forming a bidirectional connection. However, this idealized connectivity pattern contradicts experimental observations in the brain, a discrepancy we refer to as the weight symmetry problem. To address this challenge posed by considering biological constraints on connectivity, we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. We demonstrate that PFA can eliminate explicit weight symmetry entirely while closely approximating backpropagation and achieving comparable performance in deep convolutional networks. Our results offer a novel approach to solve the longstanding problem of credit assignment in the brain, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep networks compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new algorithms for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with outliers. Utilizing techniques from computational geometry, specifically higher-degree Voronoi diagrams, we navigate to the optimal subspace for PCA even in the presence of outliers. This approach achieves an optimal solution with a time complexity of $n^{d+\mathcal{O}(1)}\text{poly}(n,d)$. Additionally, we present a randomized algorithm with a complexity of $2^{\mathcal{O}(r(d-r))} \times \text{poly}(n, d)$. This algorithm samples subspaces characterized in terms of a Grassmannian manifold. By employing such sampling method, we ensure a high likelihood of capturing the optimal subspace, with the success probability $(1 - \delta)^T$. Where $\delta$ represents the probability that a sampled subspace does not contain the optimal solution, and $T$ is the number of subspaces sampled, proportional to $2^{r(d-r)}$. Our use of higher-degree Voronoi diagrams and Grassmannian based sampling offers a clearer conceptual pathway and practical advantages, particularly in handling large datasets or higher-dimensional settings.

<title>Temporal Source Recovery for Time-Series Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) data has grown in importance with the rise of Internet of Things devices like sensors, but its labeling remains costly and complex. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDAs) offers an effective solution, growing data privacy concerns have led to the development of Source-Free UDA (SFUDAs), enabling model adaptation to target domains without accessing source data. Despite their potential, applying existing SFUDAs to TS data is challenging due to the difficulty of transferring temporal dependencies, an essential characteristic of TS data, particularly in the absence of source samples. Although prior works attempt to address this by specific source pretraining designs, such requirements are often impractical, as source data owners cannot be expected to adhere to particular pretraining schemes. To address this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that leverages the intrinsic properties of TS data to generate a source-like domain and recover source temporal dependencies. With this domain, TemSR enables dependency transfer to the target domain without accessing source data or relying on source-specific designs, thereby facilitating effective and practical TS-SFUDA. TemSR features a masking recovery optimization process to generate a source-like distribution with restored temporal dependencies. This distribution is further refined through local context-aware regularization to preserve local dependencies, and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to promote distributional diversity. Together, these components enable effective temporal dependency recovery and facilitate transfer across domains using standard UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, which even surpasses existing TS-SFUDA methods that require source-specific designs.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides individuals who receive undesirable outcomes from machine learning systems with minimum-cost improvements to achieve a desirable outcome. However, machine learning models often get updated, so the recourse may not lead to the desired outcome. The robust recourse framework chooses recourses that are less sensitive to adversarial model changes, but this comes at a higher cost. To address this, we initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithmic recourse and evaluate the extent to which a designer equipped with a prediction of the future model can reduce the cost of recourse when the prediction is accurate (consistency) while also limiting the cost even when the prediction is inaccurate (robustness). We propose a novel algorithm, study the robustness-consistency trade-off, and analyze how prediction accuracy affects performance.

Abstract: Low-Dimension-to-High-Dimension (LDHD) generalization is a special case of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, where the training data are restricted to a low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional testing space. Assuming that each instance is generated from a latent variable and the dimension of the latent variable reflects the problem scale, the inherent scaling challenge in length generalization can be captured by the LDHD generalization in the latent space. We theoretically demonstrate that LDHD generalization is generally unattainable without exploiting prior knowledge to provide appropriate inductive bias. Specifically, we explore LDHD generalization in Boolean functions. We verify that different architectures trained with (S)GD converge to \emph{min-degree interpolators w.r.t. different independent sets}. LDHD generalization is achievable if and only if the target function coincides with this inductive bias. Applying the insights from LDHD generalization to length generalization, we explain the effectiveness of CoT as changing the structure latent space to enable better LDHD generalization. We also propose a principle for position embedding design to handle both the inherent LDHD generalization and the nuisances such as the data format. Following the principle, we propose a novel position embedding called RPE-Square that remedies the RPE for dealing with the data format nuisance.

Abstract: The information exponent ([BAGJ21]) and its extensions -- which are equivalent to the lowest
  degree in the Hermite expansion of the link function (after a potential label transform) for Gaussian single-index
  models -- have played an important role in predicting the sample complexity of online stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) in various learning tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that, for multi-index models, focusing solely on the
  lowest degree can miss key structural details of the model and result in suboptimal rates.
  Specifically, we consider the task of learning target functions of form $f_*(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{P} \phi(\mathbf{v}_k^* \cdot \mathbf{x})$,
  where $P \ll d$, the ground-truth directions $\{ \mathbf{v}_k^* \}_{k=1}^P$ are orthonormal, and the information exponent of
  $\phi$ is $L$. Based on the theory of information exponent, when $L = 2$, only the relevant subspace (not the exact
  directions) can be recovered due to the rotational invariance of the second-order terms, and when $L > 2$,
  recovering the directions using online SGD require $\tilde{O}(P d^{L-1})$ samples. In this work, we show that by
  considering both second- and higher-order terms, we can first learn the relevant space using the second-order
  terms, and then the exact directions using the higher-order terms, and the overall sample and complexity of online
  SGD is $\tilde{O}( d P^{L-1} )$.

<title>Comparative Performance of Collaborative Bandit Algorithms: Effect of Sparsity and Exploration Intensity</title>

Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of collaborative bandit algorithms and provides a thorough comparison of their performance. Collaborative bandits aim to improve the performance of contextual bandits by introducing relationships between arms (or items), allowing effective propagation of information. Collaboration among arms allows the feedback obtained through a single user (item) to be shared across related users (items). Introducing collaboration also alleviates the cold user (item) problem, i.e., lack of historical information when a new user (item) arriving to the platform with no prior record of interactions. In the context of modeling the relationships between arms (items), there are two main approaches: Hard and soft clustering. We call approaches that model the relationship between arms in an \textit{absolute} manner as hard clustering, i.e., the relationship is binary. Soft clustering relaxes membership constraints, allowing \textit{fuzzy} assignment. Focusing on the latter, we provide extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms and investigate the effect of sparsity and how the exploration intensity acts as a correction mechanism. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that controlling for sparsity in collaboration improves data efficiency and performance as it better informs learning. Meanwhile, increasing the exploration intensity acts as a correction because it effectively reduces variance due to potentially misspecified relationships among users. We observe that this misspecification is further remedied by introducing latent factors, and thus, increasing the dimensionality of the bandit parameters.

Abstract: Neural collapse (NC) and its multi-layer variant, deep neural collapse (DNC), describe a structured geometry that occurs in the features and weights of trained deep networks. Recent theoretical work by Sukenik et al. using a deep unconstrained feature model (UFM) suggests that DNC is suboptimal under mean squared error (MSE) loss. They heuristically argue that this is due to low-rank bias induced by L2 regularization. In this work, we extend this result to deep UFMs trained with cross-entropy loss, showing that high-rank structures, including DNC, are not generally optimal. We characterize the associated low-rank bias, proving a fixed bound on the number of non-negligible singular values at global minima as network depth increases. We further analyze the loss surface, demonstrating that DNC is more prevalent in the landscape than other critical configurations, which we argue explains its frequent empirical appearance. Our results are validated through experiments in deep UFMs and deep neural networks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce JDCL - a new method for continual learning with generative rehearsal based on joint diffusion models. Neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting defined as abrupt loss in the model's performance when retrained with additional data coming from a different distribution. Generative-replay-based continual learning methods try to mitigate this issue by retraining a model with a combination of new and rehearsal data sampled from a generative model. In this work, we propose to extend this idea by combining a continually trained classifier with a diffusion-based generative model into a single - jointly optimized neural network. We show that such shared parametrization, combined with the knowledge distillation technique allows for stable adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, where it outperforms recent state-of-the-art generative replay techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to the semi-supervised continual learning setup, where it outperforms competing buffer-based replay techniques, and evaluate, in a self-supervised manner, the quality of trained representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate confident yet inaccurate responses, introducing significant risks for deployment in safety-critical domains. We present a novel, test-time approach to detecting model hallucination through systematic analysis of information flow across model layers. We target cases when LLMs process inputs with ambiguous or insufficient context. Our investigation reveals that hallucination manifests as usable information deficiencies in inter-layer transmissions. While existing approaches primarily focus on final-layer output analysis, we demonstrate that tracking cross-layer information dynamics ($\mathcal{L}$I) provides robust indicators of model reliability, accounting for both information gain and loss during computation. $\mathcal{L}$I integrates easily with pretrained LLMs without requiring additional training or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Model merging offers an efficient alternative to multi-task learning by combining independently fine-tuned models, but most prior approaches focus mainly on avoiding task interference. We argue instead that the real potential of merging lies in achieving synergy, where tasks enhance one another. Our intuition comes from a pilot study showing that when a classifier trained on one task is paired with the encoder of another, the resulting cross-task performance strongly predicts merge quality. Moreover, adapting even a single task-specific layer can substantially improve this compatibility, suggesting a simple yet powerful lever for synergy. Building on this insight, we introduce SyMerge, a lightweight framework that jointly optimizes one task-specific layer and merging coefficients. To ensure stability without labels, SyMerge employs a robust self-labeling strategy guided by expert model predictions, avoiding the pitfalls of entropy-based adaptation. This minimalist yet principled design achieves state-of-the-art results across vision, dense prediction, and NLP benchmarks, while also producing adapted layers that transfer effectively to other merging methods. Our code is available at https://aim-skku.github.io/SyMerge/

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering remains a fundamental challenge in data mining, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets where traditional approaches fail to scale effectively. Recent Chameleon-based algorithms - Chameleon2, M-Chameleon, and INNGS-Chameleon have proposed advanced strategies but they still suffer from $O(n^2)$ computational complexity, especially for large datasets. With Chameleon2 as the base algorithm, we introduce Chameleon2++ that addresses this challenge.
  Our algorithm has three parts. First, Graph Generation - we propose an approximate $k$-NN search instead of an exact one, specifically we integrate with the Annoy algorithm. This results in fast approximate nearest neighbor computation, significantly reducing the graph generation time. Second, Graph Partitioning - we propose use of a multi-level partitioning algorithm instead of a recursive bisection one. Specifically we adapt the hMETIS algorithm instead of the FM. This is because multi-level algorithms are robust to approximation introduced in the graph generation phase yielding higher-quality partitions, and that too with minimum configuration requirements. Third, Merging - we retain the flood fill heuristic that ensures connected balanced components in the partitions as well as efficient partition merging criteria leading to the final clusters.
  These enhancements reduce the overall time complexity to $O(n\log n)$, achieving scalability. On real-world benchmark datasets used in prior Chameleon works, Chameleon2++ delivers an average of 4% improvement in clustering quality. This demonstrates that algorithmic efficiency and clustering quality can co-exist in large-scale hierarchical clustering.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries alter model behavior on target classification labels by embedding triggers into data samples. While these attacks have received considerable attention in horizontal FL, they are less understood for vertical FL (VFL), where devices hold different features of the samples, and only the server holds the labels. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on VFL which (i) does not rely on gradient information from the server and (ii) considers potential collusion among multiple adversaries for sample selection and trigger embedding. Our label inference model augments variational autoencoders with metric learning, which adversaries can train locally. A consensus process over the adversary graph topology determines which datapoints to poison. We further propose methods for trigger splitting across the adversaries, with an intensity-based implantation scheme skewing the server towards the trigger. Our convergence analysis reveals the impact of backdoor perturbations on VFL indicated by a stationarity gap for the trained model, which we verify empirically as well. We conduct experiments comparing our attack with recent backdoor VFL approaches, finding that ours obtains significantly higher success rates for the same main task performance despite not using server information. Additionally, our results verify the impact of collusion on attack performance.

<title>Learning to Bid in Non-Stationary Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>

Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in their reasoning capabilities, hold transformative potential for addressing complex challenges and boosting scientific discovery in atmospheric science. However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Toward this end, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. AtmosSci-Bench features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs), enabling scalable automated evaluation alongside deeper analysis of conceptual understanding. We employ a template-based MCQ generation framework to create diverse, graduate-level problems with symbolic perturbation, while OEQs are used to probe open-ended reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate services by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/AtmosSci-Bench.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in robotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to offline universal perturbation attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP), and Vector-Quantizied Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these methods to universal adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal that most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We also show that these attacks are often transferable across algorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a systematic study of the vulnerabilities of different LfD algorithms to both white-box and black-box attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of modern BC algorithms, paving the way for future work in addressing such limitations.

<title>From Restless to Contextual: A Thresholding Bandit Reformulation For Finite-horizon Performance</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the poor finite-horizon performance of existing online \emph{restless bandit} (RB) algorithms, which stems from the prohibitive sample complexity of learning a full \emph{Markov decision process} (MDP) for each agent. We argue that superior finite-horizon performance requires \emph{rapid convergence} to a \emph{high-quality} policy. Thus motivated, we introduce a reformulation of online RBs as a \emph{budgeted thresholding contextual bandit}, which simplifies the learning problem by encoding long-term state transitions into a scalar reward. We prove the first non-asymptotic optimality of an oracle policy for a simplified finite-horizon setting. We propose a practical learning policy under a heterogeneous-agent, multi-state setting, and show that it achieves a sublinear regret, achieving \emph{faster convergence} than existing methods. This directly translates to higher cumulative reward, as empirically validated by significant gains over state-of-the-art algorithms in large-scale heterogeneous environments. Our work provides a new pathway for achieving practical, sample-efficient learning in finite-horizon RBs.

<title>Taming Latency-Memory Trade-Off in MoE-Based LLM Serving via Fine-Grained Expert Offloading</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing various applications, including content generation, search and recommendation, and AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However, despite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory inefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to offload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving efficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or high model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs.
  To tame the latency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present FineMoE, a fine-grained expert offloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with memory efficiency. We design FineMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection patterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently guide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. FineMoE is prototyped on top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed. Experiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that FineMoE reduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 39% over state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Operator learning for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) has seen rapid progress in recent years, enabling efficient approximation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics. However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. Here, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 60-80 % and speed-ups of 30-40 % at inference time. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zwu88/TANTE for transparency and reproducibility.

<title>Fed-SB: A Silver Bullet for Extreme Communication Efficiency and Performance in (Private) Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become ubiquitous for efficiently fine-tuning foundation models. However, federated fine-tuning using LoRA is challenging due to suboptimal updates arising from traditional federated averaging of individual adapters. Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high communication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer from performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce Federated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of LLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB optimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full fine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B and A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact updates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent of the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves state-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by up to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1) reducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for differential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other methods. Overall, Fed-SB offers a state-of-the-art, efficient, and scalable solution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

Abstract: Inference scaling methods for LLMs often rely on decomposing problems into steps (or groups of tokens), followed by sampling and selecting the best next steps. However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have remarkably succeeded in various image processing tasks. However, their large size and computational complexity present significant challenges for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an innovative approach for integrating Mamba Architecture within a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) process to address the challenge of reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy in image classification tasks. The proposed framework distills a large teacher model into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks. Each student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within the Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing computational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For MNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models as a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's performance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's FLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students achieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student retaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy. These results confirm the flexibility and scalability of Mamba Architecture, which can be integrated into PKD, succeeding in the process of finding students as weak learners. The framework provides a solution for deploying complex neural networks in real-time applications with a reduction in computational cost.

Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.

Abstract: Active learning aims to efficiently build a labeled training set by strategically selecting samples to query labels from annotators. In this sequential process, each sample acquisition influences subsequent selections, causing dependencies among samples in the labeled set. However, these dependencies are overlooked during the model parameter estimation stage when updating the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a conventional method that assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. We propose Dependency-aware MLE (DMLE), which corrects MLE within the active learning framework by addressing sample dependencies typically neglected due to the i.i.d. assumption, ensuring consistency with active learning principles in the model parameter estimation process. This improved method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, reaching higher performance in earlier cycles compared to conventional MLE. Specifically, we observe average accuracy improvements of 6%, 8.6%, and 10.5% for k=1, k=5, and k=10 respectively, after collecting the first 100 samples, where entropy is the acquisition function and k is the query batch size acquired at every active learning cycle. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/neu-spiral/DMLEforAL

Abstract: This work tackles the fundamental challenges in Federated Learning (FL) posed by arbitrary client participation and data heterogeneity, prevalent characteristics in practical FL settings. It is well-established that popular FedAvg-style algorithms struggle with exact convergence and can suffer from slow convergence rates since a decaying learning rate is required to mitigate these scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of stochastic matrix and the corresponding time-varying graphs as a novel modeling tool to accurately capture the dynamics of arbitrary client participation and the local update procedure. Leveraging this approach, we offer a fresh decentralized perspective on designing FL algorithms and present FOCUS, Federated Optimization with Exact Convergence via Push-pull Strategy, a provably convergent algorithm designed to effectively overcome the previously mentioned two challenges. More specifically, we provide a rigorous proof demonstrating that FOCUS achieves exact convergence with a linear rate regardless of the arbitrary client participation, establishing it as the first work to demonstrate this significant result.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve the generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) reflects the brain's functional state, making it a crucial tool for diverse detection applications like seizure detection and sleep stage classification. While deep learning-based approaches have recently shown promise for automated detection, traditional models are often constrained by limited learnable parameters and only achieve modest performance. In contrast, large foundation models showed improved capabilities by scaling up the model size, but required extensive time-consuming pre-training. Moreover, both types of existing methods require complex and redundant post-processing pipelines to convert discrete labels to continuous annotations. In this work, based on the multi-scale nature of EEG events, we propose a simple U-shaped model to efficiently learn representations by capturing both local and global features using convolution and self-attentive modules for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Compared to other window-level classification models, our method directly outputs predictions at the time-step level, eliminating redundant overlapping inferences. Beyond sequence-to-sequence modeling, the architecture naturally extends to window-level classification by incorporating an attention-pooling layer. Such a paradigm shift and model design demonstrated promising efficiency improvement, cross-subject generalization, and state-of-the-art performance in various time-step and window-level classification tasks in the experiment. More impressively, our model showed the capability to be scaled up to the same level as existing large foundation models that have been extensively pre-trained over diverse datasets and outperforms them by solely using the downstream fine-tuning dataset. Our model won 1st place in the 2025 "seizure detection challenge" organized in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders.

<title>AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from pre-collected datasets, offering a practical solution for applications where online interactions are risky or costly. Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks. Overall, VIPO offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy.

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

<title>What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment.
  In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

Abstract: We propose Derivative Learning (DERL), a supervised approach that models physical systems by learning their partial derivatives. We also leverage DERL to build physical models incrementally, by designing a distillation protocol that effectively transfers knowledge from a pre-trained model to a student one. We provide theoretical guarantees that DERL can learn the true physical system, being consistent with the underlying physical laws, even when using empirical derivatives. DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizing an ODE to unseen initial conditions and a parametric PDE to unseen parameters. We also design a method based on DERL to transfer physical knowledge across models by extending them to new portions of the physical domain and a new range of PDE parameters. We believe this is the first attempt at building physical models incrementally in multiple stages.

<title>Taming OOD Actions for Offline Reinforcement Learning: An Advantage-Based Approach</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, but suffers from distribution shift, causing inaccurate evaluation and overestimation of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods counter this by conservatively discouraging all OOD actions, which limits generalization. We propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), which evaluates OOD actions via an advantage-like function and uses it to modulate the Q-function update discriminatively. Our key insight is that the (state) value function is generally learned more reliably than the action-value function; we thus use the next-state value to indirectly assess each action. We develop a PointMaze environment to clearly visualize that advantage modulation effectively selects superior OOD actions while discouraging inferior ones. Moreover, extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, with especially strong gains on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty parameter to limit the changepoints count. Determining the optimal value for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses recurrent networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark genomic datasets show that this novel method generally outperforms traditional ones in changepoint detection accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing approaches either impose strong distributional assumptions or face challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

<title>A Case for Library-Level k-Means Binning in Histogram Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>

Abstract: Modern Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from $O(N\log N)$ to $O(N)$ by aggregating gradients into fixed-size bins. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy - designed to distribute data points evenly among bins -- may overlook critical boundary values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we consider a novel approach that replaces quantile binning with a $k$-means discretizer initialized with quantile bins, and justify the swap with a proof showing how, for any $L$-Lipschitz function, k-means maximizes the worst-case explained variance of Y obtained when treating all values in a given bin as equivalent. We test this swap against quantile and uniform binning on 33 OpenML datasets plus synthetics that control for modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in three cases-most strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15 classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs 0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large MSE gains - typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exhaustive (no-binning) splitting when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the 32-64-bin GPU regime - because it is a "safe default" with large upside, yet adds only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 3.5s per feature to bin 10M rows on one Apple M1 thread).

<title>Safety Subspaces are Not Linearly Distinct: A Fine-Tuning Case Study</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially acceptable responses. However, this behavior is known to be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data, can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable directions in weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this perspective. We examine whether safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific linear subspaces, whether it can be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from distinguishable patterns in activations. Across both weight and activation spaces, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe behaviors also amplify useful ones, and prompts with different safety implications activate overlapping representations. Rather than residing in distinct directions, we show that safety is highly entangled with the general learning components of the model. This suggests that subspace-based defenses face fundamental limitations and underscores the need for alternative strategies to preserve safety under continued training. We corroborate these findings with multiple experiments on five open-source LLMs from the Llama and Qwen families. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/safety-subspaces.

<title>Directional Convergence, Benign Overfitting of Gradient Descent in leaky ReLU two-layer Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers trained on mixture data via gradient descent. We provide both, upper and lower classification error bounds, and discover a phase transition in the bound as a function of signal strength. The lower bound leads to a characterization of cases when benign overfitting provably fails even if directional convergence occurs. Our analysis allows us to considerably relax the distributional assumptions that are made in existing work on benign overfitting of leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers. We can allow for non-sub-Gaussian data and do not require near orthogonality. Our results are derived by establishing directional convergence of the network parameters and studying classification error bounds for the convergent direction. Previously, directional convergence in (leaky) ReLU neural networks was established only for gradient flow. By first establishing directional convergence, we are able to study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers in a much wider range of scenarios than was done before.

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility and expressiveness. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP and kernel method-specific adaptation like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values is generally intractable, leading existing methods to rely on approximations and thereby incur unavoidable error. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. The core of our approach is a new value function, the functional baseline value function, specifically designed for product-kernel models. This value function removes the influence of a feature subset by setting its functional component to the least informative state. Crucially, it allows a recursive thus efficient computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. As an important additional contribution, we show that our framework extends beyond predictive modeling to statistical inference. In particular, it generalizes to popular kernel-based discrepancy measures such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thereby providing new tools for interpretable statistical inference.

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in. This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate- and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call ``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++ demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future advancements in LBMs.

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for narrow tasks in resource-constrained settings, a central question arises: how much of an LLM is truly necessary for a given task? We present LLM-Sieve, a framework that prunes LLMs down to the minimal parameter subset needed to preserve task performance. Our approach introduces two innovations: (i) output-aligned non-orthogonal projections, which yield more faithful low-rank approximations than traditional PCA/SVD by aligning directly with layer outputs; and (ii) adaptive pruning via a Genetic Algorithm, which automatically discovers matrix-specific pruning levels and exposes the uneven distribution of task-relevant knowledge. Across models from 3.8B to 70B parameters, LLM-Sieve removes 20-75% of weights with only 1-5% accuracy loss-substantially ahead of prior pruning methods. Beyond efficiency, our framework reveals bottleneck matrices that concentrate critical knowledge, suggesting architectural implications for future LLM design. LLM-Sieve integrates seamlessly with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization, enabling both efficient deployment and deeper understanding of knowledge organization in LLMs.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sample quality, but require the expensive solution of a differential equation at inference time. Flow map models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass many recent efforts to improve inference-time efficiency by learning the solution operator of this differential equation. Yet despite their promise, these models lack a unified description that clearly explains how to learn them efficiently in practice. Here, building on the methodology proposed in Boffi et. al. (2024), we present a systematic algorithmic framework for directly learning the flow map associated with a flow or diffusion model. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert any distillation scheme into a direct training algorithm via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained teachers. We introduce three algorithmic families based on different mathematical characterizations of the flow map: Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Progressive methods, which we show encompass and extend all known distillation and direct training schemes for consistency models. We find that the novel class of Lagrangian methods, which avoid both spatial derivatives and bootstrapping from small steps by design, achieve significantly more stable training and higher performance than more standard Eulerian and Progressive schemes. Our methodology unifies existing training schemes under a single common framework and reveals new design principles for accelerated generative modeling.

However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RL finetuning: some show substantial performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights, we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data augmentation scheme applied prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated augmentation can significantly increase the performance gain from RL over the pre-RL model.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical domains but suffers from sample inefficiency, training instability, and limited interpretability. Data attribution provides a principled way to trace model behavior back to training samples, yet existing methods assume fixed datasets, which is violated in online RL where each experience both updates the policy and shapes future data collection. In this paper, we initiate the study of data attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a \emph{local} attribution framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications: diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and achieves higher returns. Together, these results open a new direction for making online RL more interpretable, efficient, and effective.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms, changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects, thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method, full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large datasets. Although empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting, as well as gradient-based mini-batch algorithms, converge faster than full-batch EM, they generally underperform in terms of final likelihood. We investigate this gap by establishing a novel theoretical connection between these practical algorithms and the general EM objective. Our analysis reveals a fundamental issue that existing mini-batch EM and gradient-based methods fail to properly regularize distribution changes, causing each update to effectively ``overfit'' the current mini-batch. Motivated by this insight, we introduce anemone, a new mini-batch EM algorithm for PCs. Anemone applies an implicit adaptive learning rate to each parameter, scaled by how much it contributes to the likelihood of the current batch. Across extensive experiments on language, image, and DNA datasets, anemone consistently outperforms existing optimizers in both convergence speed and final performance.

Abstract: Neural networks trained on real-world data often exhibit biases while simultaneously being vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at extracting sensitive information. Despite extensive research on each problem individually, their intersection remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the privacy impact of spurious correlation bias. We introduce \emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon in which spurious groups are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We observe that privacy disparity between groups increases in tasks with simpler objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to spurious features. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that spurious robust methods, designed to reduce spurious bias, fail to mitigate privacy disparity. Our analysis reveals that this occurs because robust methods can reduce reliance on spurious features for prediction, but do not prevent their memorization during training. Finally, we systematically compare the privacy of different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that, contrary to previous work, architectural choice can affect privacy evaluation.

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach, while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Project page at https://diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Nicholas0228/unlearned_data_extraction_llm.

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation, adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses - perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Memory prefetching has long boosted CPU caches and is increasingly vital for far-memory systems, where large portions of memory are offloaded to cheaper, remote tiers. While effective prefetching requires accurate prediction of future accesses, prior ML approaches have been limited to simulation or small-scale hardware. We introduce FarSight, the first Linux-based far-memory system to leverage deep learning by decoupling application semantics from runtime memory layout. This separation enables offline-trained models to predict access patterns over a compact ordinal vocabulary, which are resolved at runtime through lightweight mappings. Across four data-intensive workloads, FarSight delivers up to 3.6x higher performance than the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: We study the problem active sequential hypothesis testing, also known as pure exploration: given a new task, the learner adaptively collects data from the environment to efficiently determine an underlying correct hypothesis. A classical instance of this problem is the task of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit problem (a.k.a. BAI, Best-Arm Identification), where actions index hypotheses. Another important case is generalized search, a problem of determining the correct label through a sequence of strategically selected queries that indirectly reveal information about the label. In this work, we introduce In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), which meta-trains Transformers to map observation histories to query actions and a predicted hypothesis, yielding a model that transfers in-context. At inference time, ICPE actively gathers evidence on new tasks and infers the true hypothesis without parameter updates. Across deterministic, stochastic, and structured benchmarks, including BAI and generalized search, ICPE is competitive with adaptive baselines while requiring no explicit modeling of information structure. Our results support Transformers as practical architectures for general sequential testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation. However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models, achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, and often failed to maximizing the consistency to the measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To address these issues, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that flexibly balances prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches such as DDNM, TMPD, while generalizing to handle both known Gaussian noise and unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of tasks, while maintaining relatively low computational cost.

Abstract: Here we present a series of artificial models - a total of four related models - based on machine learning techniques that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar curatorship work. Out of our four artificial intelligence models, three achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; and second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them almost as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach.

<title>Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the first study of grokking in practical LLM pretraining. Specifically, we investigate when an LLM memorizes the training data, when its generalization on downstream tasks starts to improve, and what happens if there is a lag between the two. Unlike existing works studying when a small model generalizes to limited and specified tasks during thousands epochs' training on algorithmic data, we focus on a practical setting for LLMs, i.e., one-epoch pretraining of next-token prediction on a cross-domain, large-scale corpus, and generalization on diverse benchmark tasks covering math/commonsense reasoning, code generation, and domain-specific retrieval. Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still emerges in pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, though different local data groups may enter their grokking stages asynchronously due to the heterogeneity of their distributions and attributions to others. To find a mechanistic interpretation of this local grokking, we investigate the dynamics of training data's pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers in MoE). Our primary discovery is that the pathways evolve from random, non-smooth across layers, instance-specific to more structured and transferable across samples, despite the converged pretraining loss. This depicts a transition from memorization to generalization. Two novel metrics are developed to quantify these patterns: one computes the pathway similarity between samples, while the other measures the consistency of aggregated experts between subsequent layers for each sample. These training data based metrics induce zero cost but can faithfully track and monitor the generalization of LLMs on downstream tasks, which, in conventional settings, requires costly instruction tuning and benchmark evaluation.

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs and overestimating robustness. We show that for the goal of eliciting harmful responses, repeated sampling of model outputs during the attack complements prompt optimization and serves as a strong and efficient attack vector. By casting attacks as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal trade-offs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts success rates by up to 37\% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. We further analyze how distributions of output harmfulness evolve during an adversarial attack, discovering that many common optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a label-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy maximization, demonstrating how our sampling-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings establish the importance of sampling in attacks to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety at scale.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, matching their performance through large-scale training. However, inference-time control remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we study how to steer generation toward desired rewards without retraining the models. Prior methods typically resample or filter within a single denoising trajectory, optimizing rewards step-by-step without trajectory-level refinement. We introduce particle Gibbs sampling for diffusion language models (PG-DLM), a novel inference-time algorithm enabling trajectory-level refinement while preserving generation perplexity under reward optimization. PG-DLM constructs a Markov chain over full denoising trajectories and applies a conditional sequential Monte Carlo kernel to resample them. We derive theoretical guarantees for convergence, including asymptotic consistency and variance bounds. Within this framework, we further analyze trade-offs across four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed budgets: iterations, samples, denoising steps, and reward estimation. Our analysis shows scaling iterations achieves the best reward-perplexity trade-off. Empirically, PG-DLM consistently outperforms prior methods using MDLM and LLaDA-8B as base models across a wide range of compute budgets for reward-guided generation tasks including toxicity and sentiment control as well as linguistic acceptability.

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains such as biology, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in the availability of scalable advising systems capable of providing high-quality, well-reasoned feedback to refine proposed hypotheses and experimental designs. To address this challenge, we explore key factors that underlie the development of robust advising systems, including model size, context length, confidence estimation, and structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose language models such as Deepseek-R1 in terms of acceptance rates for self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding 90% on the ICLR 2025 test set, underscoring its potential to significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation and experimental design. The code is released at https://github.com/HowardLiu0830/GUIDE-Research-Idea-Evaluation.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense framework that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security. However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from historical trends. We attribute this to the lack of rich, physically grounded datasets directly linking atmospheric states to yields. To address this, we introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that learns representations from large satellite-based weather datasets and transfers to the ground-based limited measurements available for yield prediction. VITA is trained using detailed meteorological variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict latent atmospheric states under a seasonality-aware sinusoidal prior. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using limited weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios, particularly during extreme years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p < 0.0001$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN without soil data, and bigger foundational models (e.g., Chronos-Bolt) with less compute, making it practical for real-world use--especially in data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.

<title>Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data. Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary dot-product attention.

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a \emph{Physics-informed (Pi)} regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Eikonal-regularized HIQL (Eik-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion ('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals: (a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would otherwise go un-noticed.

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

<title>When Judgment Becomes Noise: How Design Failures in LLM Judge Benchmarks Silently Undermine Validity</title>

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We released our code and dataset at https://github.com/penfever/judgment-to-noise

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

<title>RL Grokking Recipe: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Algorithms in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code -- Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding -- a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? -- and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<title>Active Attacks: Red-teaming LLMs via Adaptive Environments</title>

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/active_attacks}{here}.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.

<title>Emergence of Superposition: Unveiling the Training Dynamics of Chain of Continuous Thought</title>

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT) improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions. The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the growth of logits further validate our theory.

<title>InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal Interactions</title>

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Generative Oversampling Using an Entropy-Guided Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate. Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases (VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank, a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40% compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a Deterministic Annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and machine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity and high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full covariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts have been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts, reducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local covariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts substantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we construct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo samplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process expert parameters. This greatly improves inference compared to importance sampling, particularly in settings when a stationary Gaussian process is inappropriate, while still being thoroughly parallelizable.

<title>Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation: An Efficient Decoding Procedure For Hidden Markov Models</title>

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are characterized by an unobservable Markov chain and an observable process -- a noisy version of the hidden chain. Decoding the original signal from the noisy observations is one of the main goals in nearly all HMM based data analyses. Existing decoding algorithms such as Viterbi and the pointwise maximum a posteriori (PMAP) algorithm have computational complexity at best linear in the length of the observed sequence, and sub-quadratic in the size of the state space of the hidden chain.
  We present Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation (QATS), a divide-and-conquer procedure with computational complexity polylogarithmic in the length of the sequence, and cubic in the size of the state space, hence particularly suited for large scale HMMs with relatively few states. It also suggests an effective way of data storage as specific cumulative sums. In essence, the estimated sequence of states sequentially maximizes local likelihood scores among all local paths with at most three segments, and is meanwhile admissible. The maximization is performed only approximately using an adaptive search procedure. Our simulations demonstrate the speedups offered by QATS in comparison to Viterbi and PMAP, along with a precision analysis. An implementation of QATS is in the R-package QATS on GitHub.

Abstract: We develop a fitted value iteration (FVI) method to compute bicausal optimal transport (OT) where couplings have an adapted structure. Based on the dynamic programming formulation, FVI adopts a function class to approximate the value functions in bicausal OT. Under the concentrability condition and approximate completeness assumption, we prove the sample complexity using (local) Rademacher complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multilayer neural networks with appropriate structures satisfy the crucial assumptions required in sample complexity proofs. Numerical experiments reveal that FVI outperforms linear programming and adapted Sinkhorn methods in scalability as the time horizon increases, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Abstract: The potential of Large Language Model (LLM) as agents has been widely acknowledged recently. Thus, there is an urgent need to quantitatively \textit{evaluate LLMs as agents} on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional benchmark that consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities. Our extensive test over \num API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and many OSS competitors that are no larger than 70B. We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents. Improving instruction following and training on high quality multi-round alignment data could improve agent performance. And different from existing assumptions, training on code present ambivalent impacts on different agent tasks. Datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench.

<title>Robust MRI Reconstruction by Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG)</title>

arXiv:2312.07784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to test practical privacy of machine learning models. MIAs complement formal guarantees from differential privacy (DP) under a more realistic adversary model. We analyse MIA vulnerability of fine-tuned neural networks both empirically and theoretically, the latter using a simplified model of fine-tuning. We show that the vulnerability of non-DP models when measured as the attacker advantage at a fixed false positive rate reduces according to a simple power law as the number of examples per class increases. A similar power-law applies even for the most vulnerable points, but the dataset size needed for adequate protection of the most vulnerable points is very large.

Abstract: We introduce RealKIE, a benchmark of five challenging datasets aimed at advancing key information extraction methods, with an emphasis on enterprise applications. The datasets include a diverse range of documents including SEC S1 Filings, US Non-disclosure Agreements, UK Charity Reports, FCC Invoices, and Resource Contracts. Each presents unique challenges: poor text serialization, sparse annotations in long documents, and complex tabular layouts. These datasets provide a realistic testing ground for key information extraction tasks like investment analysis and contract analysis. In addition to presenting these datasets, we offer an in-depth description of the annotation process, document processing techniques, and baseline modeling approaches. This contribution facilitates the development of NLP models capable of handling practical challenges and supports further research into information extraction technologies applicable to industry-specific problems.

<title>Data-Driven Performance Guarantees for Classical and Learned Optimizers</title>

arXiv:2404.13831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to analyze the performance of continuous optimization algorithms using generalization guarantees from statistical learning theory. We study classical and learned optimizers to solve families of parametric optimization problems. We build generalization guarantees for classical optimizers, using a sample convergence bound, and for learned optimizers, using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework. To train learned optimizers, we use a gradient-based algorithm to directly minimize the PAC-Bayes upper bound. Numerical experiments in signal processing, control, and meta-learning showcase the ability of our framework to provide strong generalization guarantees for both classical and learned optimizers given a fixed budget of iterations. For classical optimizers, our bounds are much tighter than those that worst-case guarantees provide. For learned optimizers, our bounds outperform the empirical outcomes observed in their non-learned counterparts.

<title>Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions</title>

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.
  We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.
  We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\alpha \in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\alpha$. Our algorithm achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.

<title>CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem</title>

arXiv:2406.07124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.

<title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach extends the Information Bottleneck principle to heterogeneous data through generalised product kernels, integrating continuous, nominal, and ordinal variables within a unified optimization framework. We address the following challenges: developing a systematic bandwidth selection strategy that equalises contributions across variable types, and proposing an adaptive hyperparameter updating scheme that ensures a valid solution into a predetermined number of potentially imbalanced clusters. Through simulations on 28,800 synthetic data sets and ten publicly available benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method, named DIBmix, achieves superior performance compared to four established methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, FAMD with K-Means, and PAM with Gower's dissimilarity). Results show DIBmix particularly excels when clusters exhibit size imbalances, data contain low or moderate cluster overlap, and categorical and continuous variables are equally represented. The method presents a significant advantage over traditional centroid-based algorithms, establishing DIBmix as a competitive and theoretically grounded alternative for mixed-type data clustering.

<title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early Stopping</title>

Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization.

<title>ClinicRealm: Re-evaluating Large Language Models with Conventional Machine Learning for Non-Generative Clinical Prediction Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medicine. However, their utility in non-generative clinical prediction, often presumed inferior to specialized models, remains under-evaluated, leading to ongoing debate within the field and potential for misuse, misunderstanding, or over-reliance due to a lack of systematic benchmarking. Our ClinicRealm study addresses this by benchmarking 15 GPT-style LLMs, 5 BERT-style models, and 11 traditional methods on unstructured clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), while also assessing their reasoning, reliability, and fairness. Key findings reveal a significant shift: for clinical note predictions, leading LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.1-Think, GPT-5) in zero-shot settings now decisively outperform finetuned BERT models. On structured EHRs, while specialized models excel with ample data, advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3.1-Think) show potent zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models in data-scarce settings. Notably, leading open-source LLMs can match or exceed proprietary counterparts. These results provide compelling evidence that modern LLMs are competitive tools for non-generative clinical prediction, particularly with unstructured text and offering data-efficient structured data options, thus necessitating a re-evaluation of model selection strategies. This research should serve as an important insight for medical informaticists, AI developers, and clinical researchers, potentially prompting a reassessment of current assumptions and inspiring new approaches to LLM application in predictive healthcare.

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus thus far has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In the proportional regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibits behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and test errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for (i) a random teacher model, (ii) a deterministic teacher model where the weights are perfectly aligned with the covariance of the data. Under the random teacher model setting, we also verify that the generalized cross-validation (GCV) estimator can consistently estimate the generalization error in the quadratic regime for anisotropic data. Our proof techniques combine moment methods, Wick's formula, orthogonal polynomials, and resolvent analysis of random matrices with correlated entries.

Abstract: Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.

Abstract: We study the approximation capacity of deep ReLU recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and explore the convergence properties of nonparametric least squares regression using RNNs. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of RNNs for H\"older smooth functions, in the sense that the output at each time step of an RNN can approximate a H\"older function that depends only on past and current information, termed a past-dependent function. This allows a carefully constructed RNN to simultaneously approximate a sequence of past-dependent H\"older functions. We apply these approximation results to derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the prediction error of the empirical risk minimizer in regression problem. Our error bounds achieve minimax optimal rate under both exponentially $\beta$-mixing and i.i.d. data assumptions, improving upon existing ones. Our results provide statistical guarantees on the performance of RNNs.

Abstract: We use the embedding formalism to construct conformal fields in $D$ dimensions, by restricting Lorentz-invariant ensembles of homogeneous neural networks in $(D+2)$ dimensions to the projective null cone. Conformal correlators may be computed using the parameter space description of the neural network. Exact four-point correlators are computed in a number of examples, and we perform a 4D conformal block decomposition that elucidates the spectrum. In some examples the analysis is facilitated by recent approaches to Feynman integrals. Generalized free CFTs are constructed using the infinite-width Gaussian process limit of the neural network, enabling a realization of the free boson. The extension to deep networks constructs conformal fields at each subsequent layer, with recursion relations relating their conformal dimensions and four-point functions. Numerical approaches are discussed.

Abstract: Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

<title>Multi-Turn Human-LLM Interaction Through the Lens of a Two-Way Intelligibility Protocol</title>

Abstract: Our interest is in the design of software systems involving a human-expert interacting -- using natural language -- with a large language model (LLM) on data analysis tasks. For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects. The results provide evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way intelligibility in the design of human-machine systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/karannb/interact.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification models rely on multi-label attention to focus on key tokens in input text, but learning good attention weights is challenging. We introduce PLANT - Pretrained and Leveraged Attention - a plug-and-play strategy for initializing attention. PLANT works by planting label-specific attention using a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model guided by mutual information gain. This architecture-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with large language model backbones such as Mistral-7B, LLaMA3-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and Phi-3. PLANT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks including ICD coding, legal topic classification, and content recommendation. Gains are especially pronounced in few-shot settings, with substantial improvements on rare labels. Ablation studies confirm that attention initialization is a key driver of these gains.

arXiv:2411.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing tools for explaining complex models and systems are associational rather than causal and do not provide mechanistic understanding. We propose a new notion called counterfactual explainability for causal attribution that is motivated by the concept of genetic heritability in twin studies. Counterfactual explainability extends methods for global sensitivity analysis (including the functional analysis of variance and Sobol's indices), which assumes independent explanatory variables, to dependent explanations by using a directed acyclic graphs to describe their causal relationship. Therefore, this explanability measure directly incorporates causal mechanisms by construction. Under a comonotonicity assumption, we discuss methods for estimating counterfactual explainability and apply them to a real dataset dataset to explain income inequality by gender, race, and educational attainment.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.

<title>H3Fusion: Helpful, Harmless, Honest Fusion of Aligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: Alignment of pretrained LLMs using instruction-based datasets is critical for creating fine-tuned models that reflect human preference. A growing number of alignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling the efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful, harmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This paper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined as $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles multiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model with enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust alignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second, $H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We first freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while tuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model weights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and dynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the output response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting $H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The former penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter mediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts the fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the experts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that $H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\%$, and it provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by $13.77\%$.

Abstract: From structural biology to epidemiology, predictions from machine learning (ML) models increasingly complement costly gold-standard data to enable faster, more affordable, and scalable scientific inquiry. In response, prediction-based (PB) inference has emerged to accommodate statistical analysis using a large volume of predictions together with a small amount of gold-standard data. The goals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate bias from errors in predictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to classical inference using only the gold-standard data. While early PB inference methods focused on bias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains a focus of ongoing research. We revisit a foundational PB inference method and show that a simple modification can be applied to guarantee provable improvements in efficiency. In doing so, we establish new connections between augmented inverse probability weighted estimators (AIPW) and several recently proposed PB inference methods with a similar focus. The utility of our proposal, which leverages prediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency, is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to real data from the UK Biobank. Further, we contextualize PB inference by drawing connections to historical literature from economics and statistics, highlighting how classic methods directly inform this contemporary problem.

Abstract: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining enormous popularity in recent years. However, the training of LLMs has raised significant privacy and legal concerns, particularly regarding the distillation and inclusion of copyrighted materials in their training data without proper attribution or licensing, an issue that falls under the broader concern of data misappropriation. In this article, we focus on a specific problem of data misappropriation detection, namely, to determine whether a given LLM has incorporated the data generated by another LLM. We propose embedding watermarks into the copyrighted training data and formulating the detection of data misappropriation as a hypothesis testing problem. We develop a general statistical testing framework, construct test statistics, determine optimal rejection thresholds, and explicitly control type I and type II errors. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed tests, and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness through intensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Autoregressive construction approaches generate solutions to vehicle routing problems in a step-by-step fashion, leading to high-quality solutions that are nearing the performance achieved by handcrafted operations research techniques. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigm of sequential solution construction and introduce an iterative search framework where solutions are instead deconstructed by a neural policy. Throughout the search, the neural policy collaborates with a simple greedy insertion algorithm to rebuild the deconstructed solutions. Our approach matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art operations research methods across three challenging vehicle routing problems of various problem sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables the model to perform new tasks conditioning only on the examples provided in the context without updating the model's weights. While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT, AI agents, and video generation, contemporary mobile systems have begun integrating these AI capabilities on local devices to enhance privacy and reduce response latency. To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth.
  In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of heterogeneous processors, SoC memory bandwidth, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different heterogeneous parallel mechanisms to fully exploit both GPU and NPU computational power and memory bandwidth. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism between heterogeneous processors that leverages the unified memory architecture. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports GPU-NPU heterogeneous execution. Evaluation shows that HeteroInfer delivers a 1.34x to 6.02x end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-only and NPU-only LLM engines, while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce k-NLPmeans and k-LLMmeans, text-clustering variants of k-means that periodically replace numeric centroids with textual summaries. The key idea, summary-as-centroid, retains k-means assignments in embedding space while producing human-readable, auditable cluster prototypes. The method is LLM-optional: k-NLPmeans uses lightweight, deterministic summarizers, enabling offline, low-cost, and stable operation; k-LLMmeans is a drop-in upgrade that uses an LLM for summaries under a fixed per-iteration budget whose cost does not grow with dataset size. We also present a mini-batch extension for real-time clustering of streaming text. Across diverse datasets, embedding models, and summarization strategies, our approach consistently outperforms classical baselines and approaches the accuracy of recent LLM-based clustering-without extensive LLM calls. Finally, we provide a case study on sequential text streams and release a StackExchange-derived benchmark for evaluating streaming text clustering.

arXiv:2502.14037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose DiffSampling, a new decoding method that leverages a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. In addition, we also propose two variations of the proposed method that aim to correct the subtle inconsistencies of common sampling strategies. Experiments involving four different text-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least on par with the existing methods it builds upon in terms of quality, while potentially improving output diversity.

Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown dynamics. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riccati operator under the Riemannian distance. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Recent work proposed state-space models (SSMs) as an efficient alternative to transformer-based LLMs. Can these models be pruned to further reduce their computation costs? We adapt several pruning methods to the SSM structure, and apply them to four SSM-based LLMs across multiple tasks. We find that such models are quite robust to some pruning methods (e.g. WANDA), while using other methods lead to fast performance degradation.

Abstract: The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to approximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common choice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of the parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy. This paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the blocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using learnable transport maps. We call the resulting joint distribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula models are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational approximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block sizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of the variational optimization using efficient stochastic gradient methods. The approach is demonstrated using four different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that are challenging to approximate. This includes models that use global-local shrinkage priors for regularization, and hierarchical models for smoothing and heteroscedastic time series. In all cases, our method produces more accurate posterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block independence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational cost. A python package implementing the method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/YuFuOliver/VCVI_Rep_PyPackage.

Abstract: While guided decoding, especially value-guided methods, has emerged as a cost-effective alternative for controlling language model outputs without re-training models, its effectiveness is limited by the accuracy of the value function. We identify that this inaccuracy stems from a core distributional gap: existing methods train static value functions on trajectories sampled exclusively from the base policy, which inherently confines their training to a narrow and suboptimal view of the potential output space. We propose Iterative Value Refinement, a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. It employs Value Exploration to provide a more comprehensive and robust training signal, complemented by Iterative Self-Refinement, which uses the improved value function from one iteration to guide the generation of higher-quality data for the next. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in aligning language models. Our approach not only achieves alignment but also significantly reduces computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.

<title>Seeded Poisson Factorization: leveraging domain knowledge to fit topic models</title>

Abstract: Topic models are widely used for discovering latent thematic structures in large text corpora, yet traditional unsupervised methods often struggle to align with pre-defined conceptual domains. This paper introduces seeded Poisson Factorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization (PF) framework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a structured topic discovery by modifying the prior distribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates to pre-defined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference with stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.
  We present in detail the results of applying SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging pre-defined product categories as guiding structures. SPF achieves superior performance compared to alternative guided probabilistic topic models in terms of computational efficiency and classification performance. Robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to adaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in case of imperfect seed word selection. Further applications of SPF to four additional benchmark datasets, where the corpus varies in size and the number of topics differs, demonstrate its general superior classification performance compared to the unseeded PF model.

<title>Graph Alignment via Birkhoff Relaxation</title>

Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.

<title>PRO-VPT: Distribution-Adaptive Visual Prompt Tuning via Prompt Relocation</title>

Abstract: Visual prompt tuning (VPT), i.e., fine-tuning some lightweight prompt tokens, provides an efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. However, most prior art indiscriminately uses a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block varying depending on the task. In this paper, we introduce adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by tackling two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through empirical analysis, we first confirm that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution built upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy derived from this formulation, comprising two steps: pruning idle prompts from prompt-saturated blocks, followed by allocating these prompts to the most prompt-needed blocks. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal can adaptively learn the optimal prompt distribution in a nested optimization-based manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms advanced VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6 pp and 2.0 pp average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on VTAB-1k and FGVC benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/ckshang/PRO-VPT.

<title>FEB-Cache: Frequency-Guided Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing Diffusion Transformer Caching</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/aSleepyTree/EB-Cache.

Abstract: Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots, playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .

Abstract: Accurately capturing the complex interaction between CO2 and water in porous media at the pore scale is essential for various geoscience applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). We introduce a comprehensive dataset generated from high-fidelity numerical simulations to capture the intricate interaction between CO2 and water at the pore scale. The dataset consists of 624 2D samples, each of size 512x512 with a resolution of 35 {\mu}m, covering 100 time steps under a constant CO2 injection rate. It includes various levels of heterogeneity, represented by different grain sizes with random variation in spacing, offering a robust testbed for developing predictive models. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information crucial for benchmarking machine learning models.

<title>RAG over Tables: Hierarchical Memory Index, Multi-Stage Retrieval, and Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with an external knowledge base to improve the answer relevance and accuracy. In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG

<title>MAD: A Magnitude And Direction Policy Parametrization for Stability Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: We introduce magnitude and direction (MAD) policies, a policy parameterization for reinforcement learning (RL) that preserves Lp closed-loop stability for nonlinear dynamical systems. Despite their completeness in describing all stabilizing controllers, methods based on nonlinear Youla and system-level synthesis are significantly impacted by the difficulty of parametrizing Lp-stable operators. In contrast, MAD policies introduce explicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the success of reinforcement learning pipelines - without jeopardizing closed-loop stability. This is achieved by letting the magnitude of the control input be described by a disturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on state-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further characterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model mismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parametrizations, MAD policies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL pipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability with no model information beyond assuming open-loop stability. Numerical experiments show that MAD policies trained with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods generalize to unseen scenarios - matching the performance of standard neural network policies while guaranteeing closed-loop stability by design.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating biases is critical for the adoption of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making. We introduce Admissions and Hiring, decision tasks with hypothetical applicant profiles where a person's race can be inferred from their name, as simplified test beds for racial bias. We show that Gemma 2B Instruct and LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct exhibit strong biases. Gemma grants admission to 26% more White than Black applicants, and LLaMA hires 60% more Asian than White applicants. We demonstrate that these biases are resistant to prompt engineering: multiple prompting strategies all fail to promote fairness. In contrast, using distributed alignment search, we can identify "race subspaces" within model activations and intervene on them to debias model decisions. Averaging the representation across all races within the subspaces reduces Gemma's bias by 37-57%. Finally, we examine the generalizability of Gemma's race subspaces, and find limited evidence for generalization, where changing the prompt format can affect the race representation. Our work suggests mechanistic approaches may provide a promising venue for improving the fairness of LLMs, but a universal race representation remains elusive.

<title>Conformalized Generative Bayesian Imaging: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Computational Imaging</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays an important role in achieving trustworthy and reliable learning-based computational imaging. Recent advances in generative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development of uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative model-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on the underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the posterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian neural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction method by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters. Unfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly quantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still persists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an existing generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and introduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by leveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be easily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and image inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the characteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on top of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent with frequentist principles.

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, making powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models a core solution. The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy systems. This paper presents the winning solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024). The solution provides accurate probabilistic forecasts for a wind-solar hybrid system, and achieves substantial trading revenue in the day-ahead electricity market. Key components include: (1) a stacking-based approach combining sister forecasts from various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) to provide wind power forecasts, (2) an online solar post-processing model to address the distribution shift in the online test set caused by increased solar capacity, (3) a probabilistic aggregation method for accurate quantile forecasts of hybrid generation, and (4) a stochastic trading strategy to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices. This paper also explores the potential of end-to-end learning to further enhance the trading revenue by shifting the distribution of forecast errors. Detailed case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. Code for all mentioned methods is available for reproduction and further research in both industry and academia.

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences. While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expression*: early layers progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers express these representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline not only substantially surpasses the previously best-performing method, yielding a 69\% relative improvement in accuracy (Dice Score from 42.53 to 71.81), but also performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training with faithful images-containing same features but different noise-outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts generalization by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer on CIFAR-10/100, and TinyImageNet, with various optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet.

Abstract: Effective feature selection is vital for robust and interpretable medical prediction, especially for identifying risk factors concentrated in extreme patient strata. Standard methods emphasize average associations and may miss predictors whose importance lies in the tails of the distribution. We propose a computationally efficient supervised filter that ranks features using the Gumbel copula upper tail dependence coefficient ($\lambda_U$), prioritizing variables that are simultaneously extreme with the positive class. We benchmarked against Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and $L_1$ Elastic Net across four classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Evaluation included paired statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks with label flips, feature noise, and missingness. On CDC, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by about 52% while retaining strong discrimination. Although using all 21 features yielded the highest AUC, our filter significantly outperformed Mutual Information and mRMR and was statistically indistinguishable from ReliefF. On PIMA, with only eight predictors, our ranking produced the numerically highest ROC AUC, and no significant differences were found versus strong baselines. Across both datasets, the upper tail criterion consistently identified clinically coherent, impactful predictors. We conclude that copula based feature selection via upper tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable approach for building risk models in public health and clinical medicine.

Abstract: Text embedding models enable semantic search, powering several NLP applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation by efficient information retrieval (IR). However, text embedding models are commonly studied in scenarios where the training data is static, thus limiting its applications to dynamic scenarios where new training data emerges over time. IR methods generally encode a huge corpus of documents to low-dimensional embeddings and store them in a database index. During retrieval, a semantic search over the corpus is performed and the document whose embedding is most similar to the query embedding is returned. When updating an embedding model with new training data, using the already indexed corpus is suboptimal due to the non-compatibility issue, since the model which was used to obtain the embeddings of the corpus has changed. While re-indexing of old corpus documents using the updated model enables compatibility, it requires much higher computation and time. Thus, it is critical to study how the already indexed corpus can still be effectively used without the need of re-indexing. In this work, we establish a continual learning benchmark with large-scale datasets and continually train dense retrieval embedding models on query-document pairs from new datasets in each task and observe forgetting on old tasks due to significant drift of embeddings. We employ embedding distillation on both query and document embeddings to maintain stability and propose a novel query drift compensation method during retrieval to project new model query embeddings to the old embedding space. This enables compatibility with previously indexed corpus embeddings extracted using the old model and thus reduces the forgetting. We show that the proposed method significantly improves performance without any re-indexing. Code is available at https://github.com/dipamgoswami/QDC.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small molecules, peptides, and proteins.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups and susceptible to strategic manipulation. To address this issue, we develop a novel preference learning framework capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Grounded in social choice theory, our approach infers the feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of population-proportional alignment and population-bounded manipulability. Moreover, we propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs population-proportional alignment with the selection of the Condorcet winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments on both tabular recommendation tasks and large language model alignment.

<title>Learning What Reinforcement Learning Can't: Interleaved Online Fine-Tuning for Hardest Questions</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach, \textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data, highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the significant potential.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either human annotation or expensive experiments. In theory, powerful pre-trained AI models provide an opportunity to automatically label datasets and save costs. Unfortunately, these models come with no guarantees on their accuracy, making wholesale replacement of manual labeling impractical. In this work, we propose a method for leveraging pre-trained AI models to curate cost-effective and high-quality datasets. In particular, our approach results in probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall labeling error is small. Our method is nonasymptotically valid under minimal assumptions on the dataset or the AI model being studied, and thus enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Abstract: Generative ML models are increasingly popular in networking for tasks such as telemetry imputation, prediction, and synthetic trace generation. Despite their capabilities, they suffer from two shortcomings: (i) their output is often visibly violating well-known networking rules, which undermines their trustworthiness; and (ii) they are difficult to control, frequently requiring retraining even for minor changes.
  To address these limitations and unlock the benefits of generative models for networking, we propose a new paradigm for integrating explicit network knowledge in the form of first-order logic rules into ML models used for networking tasks. Rules capture well-known relationships among used signals, e.g., that increased latency precedes packet loss. While the idea is conceptually straightforward, its realization is challenging: networking knowledge is rarely formalized into rules, and naively injecting them into ML models often hampers ML's effectiveness. This paper introduces NetNomos a multi-stage framework that (1) learns rules directly from data (e.g., measurements); (2) filters them to distinguish semantically meaningful ones; and (3) enforces them through a collaborative generation between an ML model and an SMT solver.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction capability is essential for deploying LLMs in safety-critical applications. We uncover a systematic failure: LLMs cannot correct errors in their own outputs while successfully correcting identical errors from external sources - a limitation we term the Self-Correction Blind Spot. To study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, an evaluation framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 open-source non-reasoning models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We provide multiple lines of evidence suggesting this limitation may be influenced by training data: human demonstrations rarely include error-correction sequences (favoring error-free responses), whereas reinforcement learning (RL) trained models learn error correction via outcome feedback. Remarkably, appending a minimal "Wait" prompt activates a 89.3% reduction in blind spots, suggesting dormant capabilities that require triggering. Our work highlights a critical limitation potentially influenced by training distribution and offers a practical approach to enhance LLM reliability and trustworthiness - vital for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we introduce a new conformal score function called prevalence-adjusted softmax that targets macro-coverage, a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage. Second, we propose a new procedure that interpolates between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction by linearly interpolating their conformal score thresholds. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet-300K and iNaturalist-2018, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically consistently outperforming all baseline models across different base models and test sets, achieving the best PickScore in every case, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Abstract: Outliers can severely distort causal effect estimation in observational studies, especially in small samples. We develop a doubly robust estimator of the ATE under a contaminated-data model that explicitly accommodates outliers. Robustness to outliers is delivered via a bounded-influence estimating equation for the outcome model and covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) for treatment assignment. To mitigate overfitting in high dimensions, we incorporate variable selection and unify all components within a penalized empirical likelihood framework. For further inference, we derive an optimal finite-sample confidence interval (CI) whose endpoints are invariant to outliers under the contaminated model. Across extensive simulations and two gene-expression applications (Golub; Khan pediatric tumor), the proposed ATE estimator and finite-sample CI outperform state-of-the-art competitors in bias, mean squared error, empirical coverage, and interval length over a wide range of contamination levels and sample sizes.

Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.

<title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>

arXiv:2507.21807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is ever-increasing, yet the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention presents a significant bottleneck. While existing sparse attention mechanisms enhance efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as static patterns and information loss. This paper introduces a Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention mechanism that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, it leverages value vectors to dynamically generate content-aware sparse masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and focus on crucial information. Second, it implements a position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we ensure that the introduced dynamic masks and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, thereby supporting end-to-end training. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to retain complete information while significantly reducing computational complexity, achieving an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. We validate the performance of Dynamic Mask Attention through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies demonstrate that our method consistently achieves Pareto dominance across various tasks, including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, general benchmarks, and needle-in-a-haystack tests, delivering up to 10 times acceleration. These results highlight its capability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling. Our computational kernel is open-sourced at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to facilitate further research and application within the community.

Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task aims to model annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and perspectivist evaluation, which focuses on modeling individual annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and improvements. In this paper, we extend DisCo by introducing annotator metadata embeddings, enhancing input representations, and multi-objective training losses to capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth calibration and error analyses that reveal when and why disagreement-aware modeling improves. Our findings show that disagreement can be better captured by conditioning on annotator demographics and by optimizing directly for distributional metrics, yielding consistent improvements across datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. We introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench, featuring simple math and general queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11 challenging reasoning tasks along with harder math problems. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we extensively evaluate 33 different thinking and non-thinking models and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other, highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, employ structured second-moment estimations and have shown strong performance for training neural networks (NNs). In practice, however, Shampoo typically requires step-size grafting with Adam to be competitive, and SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis -- at the cost of additional memory overhead from Adam in both methods. Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam. Across our experiments, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms SOAP, Shampoo, and even KL-SOAP, establishing the KL-based approach as a compelling foundation for designing structured methods in NN optimization.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. We evaluate on ARC-AGI, a benchmark that stresses compositional generalization and abstract reasoning, making it a natural fit for concept memory. Our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms fixed settings, supporting the hypothesis that accumulating and abstracting patterns enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code is available at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.

<title>Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation</title>

arXiv:2509.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection or prompting strategy). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I (false positive), Type II (false negative), Type S (wrong sign), or Type M (exaggerated effect) errors. We call this phenomenon where configuration choices lead to incorrect conclusions LLM hacking.
  We find that intentional LLM hacking is strikingly simple. By replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science studies, we show that, with just a handful of prompt paraphrases, virtually anything can be presented as statistically significant.
  Beyond intentional manipulation, our analysis of 13 million labels from 18 different LLMs across 2361 realistic hypotheses shows that there is also a high risk of accidental LLM hacking, even when following standard research practices. We find incorrect conclusions in approximately 31% of hypotheses for state-of-the-art LLMs, and in half the hypotheses for smaller language models. While higher task performance and stronger general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models remain susceptible. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of LLM-based findings near significance thresholds. We analyze 21 mitigation techniques and find that human annotations provide crucial protection against false positives. Common regression estimator correction techniques can restore valid inference but trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  We publish a list of practical recommendations to prevent LLM hacking.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation. Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy applications.

Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

arXiv:2509.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.

Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.

arXiv:2509.19341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

<title>Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence</title>

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise, emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

<title>Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836</link>

arXiv:2509.24836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Summary: <br />
The study investigates gradient descent in matrix factorization and discovers a fractal structure in the parameter space when using large step sizes. The exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization is calculated, demonstrating that the selected minimizer is highly dependent on the initialization near criticality. Furthermore, the addition of regularization amplifies this sensitivity, resulting in the creation of a fractal boundary separating convergent and divergent initializations. This phenomenon extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. The research uncovers that near-critical step sizes lead to a chaotic regime in gradient descent, where long-term dynamics become unpredictable without any clear implicit biases towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness. <div>

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases, such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Summary:
The work introduces a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), for enhancing team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). By constructing a learnable representation space that captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information through communication protocols, IWoL enables fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination without the drawbacks of explicit message passing. The representation serves as both an implicit latent and an explicit message for communication among agents. Evaluation on four challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of IWoL in facilitating team coordination. Additionally, combining IWoL with existing MARL algorithms further improves their performance. Overall, IWoL provides a simple yet powerful solution for addressing the complexities of team coordination in MARL.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.

arXiv:2509.25783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.

Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used to enhance extreme value forecasting. Deep learning models like Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM are employed for both short- and long-term predictions of extremes. The study examines the most effective data augmentation methods based on prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, with a focus on extreme regions. A novel relevance function is used for incorporating extreme values in the augmentation process. Results show that the SMOTE-based strategy outperforms others in adaptability and overall performance.

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary sequences.

Two architectures are investigated, with OpenTSLM-Flamingo outperforming baselines in text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. OpenTSLM models show high performance in sleep staging and HAR tasks, surpassing finetuned text-only models and even larger GPT models. OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences while maintaining stable memory requirements. SoftPrompt, on the other hand, requires exponentially more memory with sequence length. Expert reviews by clinicians find OpenTSLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities on ECG-QA.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is crucial for various applications such as flood forecasting and climate analysis. Existing methods often struggle to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes in rainfall. RainSeer, a new framework, interprets radar reflectivity as a structural prior to predict rain development accurately. It addresses challenges by translating radar fields into point-wise rainfall observations and bridging the gap between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer consists of a two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper aligns radar structures with ground-level rainfall, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the transformation of hydro-meteors through descent and evaporation using a spatiotemporal attention mechanism. Evaluation on public datasets shows RainSeer outperforms existing methods, reducing MAE by 13.31% and improving the fidelity of reconstructed rainfall fields. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS) measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however, introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii) bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall, through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France, 2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Advisor Models, which are trained with reinforcement learning to provide natural language steering instructions in real-time to black-box models. These lightweight parametric policies adapt to different inputs, users, or environments, improving downstream task performance compared to static prompt optimizers. Advisor Models outperform static approaches by reacting in-context and learning dynamics of the environment. The study demonstrates the generalizability of advisors across different black-box models and their ability to specialize while remaining robust to out-of-distribution inputs. Advisor Models serve as a learnable interface to black-box systems, acting as environment-specific memory and enabling personalization and adaptable AI with advanced capabilities. Dynamic optimization through Advisor Models shows promise for enhancing the performance and adaptability of black-box models in various domains. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

<div> market-based selector, training data, cost-function prediction market, coverage, aggregation strength

Summary:
The article introduces a novel market-based selector for choosing a subset of training data, addressing the challenge of diverse signals such as uncertainty and rarity. The selector uses a cost-function prediction market (LMSR) where signals act as traders, with a single liquidity parameter controlling concentration. Token budgets are managed through a price-per-token rule, with an interpretable length bias. A diversity head enhances coverage, measured through topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. The LMSR implementation results in maximum-entropy aggregation with transparent knobs for aggregation strength. Empirical results on datasets like GSM8K and AGNews show competitive performance with reduced variance and improved balance and stability. The framework provides a unified approach for multi-signal data curation under fixed computational resources, beneficial for prompt-level reasoning and classification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

Summary:
This study investigates the impact of post-training quantization (PTQ) on neural network performance in safety-critical environments. The researchers explore the concept of extreme failure resulting from dynamic PTQ and develop a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to identify network and bit-width policy pairs that may lead to catastrophic failure under quantization. Results demonstrate the existence of detrimental network-policy pairs with performance reductions of up to 65% in accuracy, compared to robust counterparts with less than a 2% decrease. The study highlights the vulnerability points of networks under PTQ and emphasizes the need for caution in real-world deployment. The findings underscore the importance of rigorous examinations of robustness and safety considerations in future deep learning research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this "detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their "robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep learning.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical, constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for efficient training.

Summary: 
This study explores enhancing biomolecule efficacy prediction using the uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection in the context of in-context learners like TabPFN. The research demonstrates that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features outperforms specialized predictors for an siRNA knockdown efficacy task. The study reveals that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR) correlates negatively with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, better performance is achieved compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This highlights the significance of leveraging model uncertainty as a label-free heuristic to optimize biomolecule efficacy predictions. <div>

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters. These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<div> Keywords: factored Markov decision processes, sample-efficient algorithms, deep reinforcement learning, Action-Controllable Factorization, contrastive learning

Summary:
ACF is a new approach to address the representation problem in reinforcement learning by discovering independently controllable latent variables from high-dimensional observations. It leverages sparsity in the fact that actions only affect a subset of variables, allowing for more efficient training. ACF directly recovers ground truth controllable factors from pixel observations on benchmark tasks with known factored structure, such as Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey. Through contrastive training, ACF outperforms baseline disentanglement algorithms consistently. This innovative technique bridges the gap between sample-efficient algorithms that rely on factored representations and deep reinforcement learning methods that handle high-dimensional inputs, offering a promising solution for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in complex environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: ACF is a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables from high-dimensional observations, leveraging sparsity and achieving superior performance on benchmark tasks with known factored structure. <div>
arXiv:2510.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

<div> Reinforcement learning, extremum seeking, robust control, time-varying systems, deep learning<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the utilization of robust model-independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to enhance the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for nonlinear time-varying systems. While DRL has the potential to efficiently control large-parameter systems through data learning, its performance deteriorates when the system model changes rapidly. Bounded ES is effective for handling time-varying systems with unknown control directions but its convergence speed decreases as the number of parameters increases. By combining DRL and bounded ES, a hybrid controller is created that outperforms individual methods, with DRL leveraging historical data to quickly control a complex system while bounded ES ensures robustness to time variations. The study includes numerical analysis on a general time-varying system and the application of the combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at a linear particle accelerator. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Summary:  
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is shown to be equivalent to Inverse Reinforcement Learning, indicating it learns a dense token-level reward model in addition to policy imitation.  
- A baseline-relative reward function is formulated to recover the dense reward signal directly from the SFT model.  
- The dense reward model allows for granular credit assignment for each token generated, offering benefits for policy improvement.  
- The Dense-Path REINFORCE method, utilizing recovered rewards, outperforms original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.  
- This work reframes SFT as a powerful reward learning mechanism, providing new opportunities to leverage expert demonstrations. <div>
arXiv:2510.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.

Summary:
- Analog in-memory computing accelerators use resistive crossbar arrays with memristive devices to efficiently perform deep neural network computations in memory.
- To achieve effective in-memory training, at least 8-bit conductance states are typically required, but many memristive devices offer only about 4-bit resolution.
- The proposed residual learning framework sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate for the errors from low-precision weight updates.
- The theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap decreases with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate.
- Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art analog training strategies under limited-state settings with moderate hardware overhead. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays, where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least 8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about 4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our cost analysis.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel method for graph generation that incorporates spectral eigenmaps to embed input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. By defining geodesic flows between these embeddings and matching distributions along these flows, SFMG captures the geometric structure of graphs beyond eigenvalues. This approach allows for flexible generation of diverse graphs and scales efficiently, offering up to 30 times speedup over diffusion-based models. Empirical results demonstrate SFMG's ability to perform on par with existing methods on various graph metrics while also generalizing well to unseen graph scales. SFMG provides a new and efficient approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow matching.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i) captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to 30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow matching.

Summary: <br />
- The study introduces a novel methodology for comparing artificial neural network models to brain responses, based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC), enabling accurate mapping between model activations and neural data.
- By applying the IATC in simulated neural network populations, mice, and humans, the study demonstrates its ability to map bidirectionally and identify detailed aspects of neural mechanisms, such as non-linear activation functions.
- The IATC facilitates accurate predictions of neural activity and specificity in mechanism identification, allowing for the distinction of response patterns from different brain areas while aligning responses within the same areas across subjects.
- The findings support the use of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system, showcasing the compatibility of neural engineering goals and neuroscientific objectives in model-brain comparisons.
- Overall, the IATC-based approach enhances previous methods of model-brain comparison, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the predictive success and mechanistic accuracy of artificial neural network models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3) identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants (GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63, AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Additionally, a message-passing algorithm is developed for efficiently computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs by leveraging graph sparsity and parallelism. The innovative approach of utilizing derivatives of GNNs to enhance expressivity represents a significant advancement in the field of graph representation learning.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism. Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new update rule called MINTO that combines the benefits of target networks and using the online network as a target in deep Reinforcement Learning. By computing the target using the minimum estimate between the Target and Online network, MINTO offers faster and more stable value function learning. This modification helps mitigate the overestimation bias that can occur when using the online network for bootstrapping. MINTO can be easily incorporated into various value-based and actor-critic algorithms without significant additional cost. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including online and offline RL and discrete and continuous action spaces, show that MINTO consistently improves performance. This demonstrates the broad applicability and effectiveness of MINTO in enhancing the learning process in deep Reinforcement Learning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Summary: 
This article discusses the use of machine learning (ML) in large-scale hydrologic modeling, focusing on the development of physically-interpretable models. The study conducted across diverse hydro-geo-climatic conditions in the CONUS region highlighted the importance of selecting model architectures based on process dominance variations in different hydrological regimes. Results show that physically-interpretable models based on the Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP) can achieve comparable performance to data-based models like the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The research emphasizes the significance of theory-informed, physically grounded approaches in hydrology, aiming for mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and interpretable model architectures.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding. Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially- and temporally-varying process dominance.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MINERVA, a novel approach to supervised feature selection that utilizes neural networks to estimate mutual information between features and targets. By decoupling representation learning from feature selection, MINERVA achieves better generalization and accurately captures complex feature-target relationships. The method employs a carefully designed loss function with sparsity-inducing regularizers to select optimal feature subsets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets, MINERVA demonstrates its efficacy in identifying exact solutions and effectively capturing ubiquitous dependency structures not typically addressed in existing literature. The two-stage process of MINERVA allows for an ensemble evaluation of feature subsets, providing a comprehensive understanding of feature importance in high-dimensional datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets. We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection, ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform exact solutions.

Summary:  
TabImpute is a pre-trained transformer model designed for imputing missing values in tabular datasets. It improves upon existing methods by offering accurate and fast imputations without the need for hyperparameter tuning at inference time. The model benefits from an entry-wise featurization technique that speeds up the process significantly compared to previous approaches. Additionally, a synthetic training data generation pipeline enhances the performance of TabImpute at test time by incorporating realistic missingness patterns. The researchers introduce MissBench, a benchmark comprising 42 OpenML datasets and 13 missingness patterns across various domains like medicine, finance, and engineering to evaluate imputation methods. TabImpute demonstrates robust performance in comparison to 11 established imputation methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling missing data in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks. However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists. Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning, we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering, showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established imputation methods.

Summary: AdaLoRA introduces dynamic rank allocation for fine-tuning large language models, but faces slow convergence and high computational overhead. To address this, HyperAdaLoRA uses a hypernetwork to accelerate convergence by dynamically generating parameters for SVD. By pruning the hypernetwork outputs, dynamic rank allocation is achieved.

arXiv:2510.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used to reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses. The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3 and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective, while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a purpose-built inspection vehicle.

<div> dataset, evaluation, benchmark, tutoring, LLMs 

Summary:
The article introduces TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark aimed at assessing the tutoring skills of large language models (LLMs) used as learning aids by students. The dataset consists of 1,490 samples focused on high-school and AP-level curricula, covering tasks such as generating adaptive explanations, providing feedback, and promoting active learning. Rubrics specific to each sample are used to evaluate LLM responses, with results showing that current LLMs struggle to effectively guide and support students. None of the frontier LLMs achieved a score above 56%, indicating significant room for improvement in tutoring capabilities. Different model families exhibit varied strengths and weaknesses, with some excelling in certain skills while lagging in others. TutorBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to guide the development of more effective AI tutors in the future. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids, it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive, provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring, samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively, with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

<div> Keywords: permutation-equivariant learning rules, neuron distribution, topological constraints, expressivity, deep learning

Summary: 
Permutation-equivariant learning rules such as SGD and Adam induce a bi-Lipschitz mapping between neurons and heavily constrain the topology of neuron distributions during training. This constraint reveals a distinction between small and large learning rates. When the learning rate is below a critical point, the training process preserves all topological structures of neurons. However, above this critical point, the process allows for topological simplifications, leading to a coarser neuron manifold and reduced model expressivity. This phenomenon, combined with the edge of stability discovery, divides the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent into two phases: smooth optimization under topological constraints followed by learning through topological simplifications. The theory is agnostic to specific architectures or loss functions, allowing for the universal application of topological methods in studying deep learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules (including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity. Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of low-precision computation in dealing with the increasing size of Generative AI models. It highlights the benefits of low-precision floating-point formats in terms of numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency. The study reveals an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights, where exponents consistently show low entropy due to $\alpha$-stable distributions from stochastic gradient descent. This leads to a theoretical compression limit around FP4.67 and the proposal of a practical FP8 format called Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8). Experimental results on large language models and diverse transcriptions show significant memory savings and throughput acceleration with perfectly lossless computations. This work establishes exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and paves the way for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2) Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden physical phenomena.

<br />Summary: EvoSpeak is a framework that combines genetic programming with large language models to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. It utilizes knowledge from high-quality GP heuristics to generate populations, translate complex GP trees into understandable natural-language explanations, and facilitate knowledge transfer across tasks. Experiments on dynamic job scheduling show that EvoSpeak generates more effective heuristics, improves convergence speed, and provides user-friendly reports. By integrating GP symbolic reasoning with LLM interpretative capabilities, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent and transparent heuristics for optimization problems. <div>

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

<div> Keywords: offline reinforcement learning, risk-averse, multimodal, risk-sensitive, Stochastic-D4RL 

Summary: 
Risk-aware offline reinforcement learning is crucial in safety-critical domains where online data collection is not feasible. The Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC) framework introduced in this study combines an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic to address the trade-off between safety and value conservatism. By differentiating a composite objective that considers distributional risk and behavior cloning loss through the generative path, RAMAC achieves risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. The framework is instantiated with diffusion and flow-matching actors, resulting in consistent improvements in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns on various Stochastic-D4RL tasks. The code for this framework is available on GitHub for implementation and further research.

arXiv:2510.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks.

This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern industries by enabling smart automation and real time connectivity. However, this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a novel dual attention based deep learning framework specifically designed for robust intrusion detection in IoT networks. The model integrates multi scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention, to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning 15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover, this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision, recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and adaptive cyber physical systems.

<div> random search, hyperparameters, loss surface, asymptotic regime, effective dimension

Summary: 
Researchers often struggle with finding the best hyperparameters for large models due to the complexity of the loss surface. However, a new theory and tools have been developed to analyze this surface. By utilizing random search techniques, a simple structure emerges near the optimum, revealing key features such as effective dimension and best possible loss. A new distribution of scores from random search within this asymptotic regime provides insight into the underlying features of the loss surface. These tools allow for the calculation of confidence intervals for optimal performance and determination of the effective number of hyperparameters. The developed techniques are available for further analysis and application. <div>

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters. Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search. Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of hyperparameters. We make these tools available at https://github.com/nicholaslourie/opda .

<div> Keywords: deep time series forecasting, performance upper bound, window-wise properties, accuracy law, training strategy 

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of determining the upper bound of performance in deep time series forecasting. Unlike image recognition, where 100% accuracy is a feasible goal, time series forecasting has a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. The study focuses on estimating this upper bound by analyzing window-wise properties, as deep time series models operate on a sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm. Through statistical tests on numerous deep forecasters, the researchers establish an exponential relationship between the forecasting error and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, referred to as the accuracy law. This law helps identify saturated tasks in benchmarks and proposes an effective training strategy for large time series models. These findings offer valuable insights for future research in the field of deep time series forecasting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law, which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates, founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC) method that addresses limitations in existing contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) techniques.
- RAGC incorporates hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA) to enhance data augmentation and contrastive learning.

- RAGC utilizes a CSADA strategy to adaptively identify and differentially treat contrastive sample pairs based on confidence levels, enhancing discriminability in representation learning.
- Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGC compared to state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Summary:
TokenFlow is a new LLM serving system designed to enhance text streaming performance. It prioritizes requests based on token buffer occupancy and consumption rate, dynamically transferring KV cache between GPU and CPU memory to optimize resource utilization. By overlapping I/O with computation and preemptive request scheduling, TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput and reduces P99 Time-To-First-Token by up to 80.2%, without compromising overall token throughput. Through extensive experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B with multiple GPUs, TokenFlow demonstrates significant improvements in responsiveness and steady generation for real-time LLM interactions. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200) demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput (accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to 80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Summary: 
The study introduces a self-supervised machine learning framework, SIT-FUSE, for detecting and mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using various satellite data sources.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025).

<div> Keywords: neural network training, synaptic plasticity, gradient descent, non-gradient dynamics, learning architectures<br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the possibility of non-gradient "curl"-like components in learning dynamics of biological neural networks. By investigating feedforward networks with different plasticity rules, the researchers found that small curl terms can mimic gradient descent, while strong curl terms can destabilize the learning process. In some cases, curl terms can even speed up learning by allowing weight dynamics to escape saddles. This study challenges the traditional view of gradient-based learning in neural networks and highlights the importance of considering diverse learning rules and network architectures for robust learning outcomes. <div>
arXiv:2510.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity, resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks.

This study investigates the impact of inference-time edits on common safety interventions in language models. Specifically, the researchers explore the effectiveness of model abliteration, a technique aimed at removing refusal-sensitive directions, on a SmolLM2-1.7B model. They conduct a controlled evaluation across multiple Safety Pretraining checkpoints, comparing original and abliterated models through 100 prompts with harmful and harmless cases. Responses are classified as Refusal or Non-Refusal by judges, with validation of judge accuracy on a subset of data. Additionally, the study examines whether models can recognize refusal in their own outputs. The results provide insights into the robustness of data-centric safety components under model edits, highlight the influence of judge selection on evaluation outcomes, and propose a protocol for incorporating inference-time edits into safety assessments. The code for this study is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated, we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

Summary:
This paper investigates the generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) in deep neural networks, specifically focusing on ReLU networks. The goal is to achieve optimal generalization rates with polynomial dependence on network depth. By balancing optimization and generalization errors, the authors establish an excess risk rate that aligns with the optimal SVM-type rate. The key technical contribution lies in controlling activation patterns near a reference model, leading to a sharper Rademacher complexity bound for deep ReLU networks trained with GD. These results provide insights into the ability of GD to achieve competitive generalization rates compared to the minimax optimal rates in the kernel setting. <div>
arXiv:2510.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions, incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

The paper discusses the importance of uncertainty quantification in Machine Learning, specifically focusing on Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) for time series data. OCP methods update thresholds based on distribution observation to address data distribution shifts over time. Performance evaluation of OCP methods typically considers coverage validity and prediction interval width minimization. The study introduces a new approach to enhance the threshold update step by evaluating the relevance of prediction intervals using a broader class of functions. This helps in preventing abrupt threshold changes and potentially results in narrower prediction intervals. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time. Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation (inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Transformer architecture, Energy efficiency, Fine-grained measurement, Component-level optimizations

Summary:
The article presents a fine-grained empirical analysis of energy consumption during inference in Large Language Models (LLMs). The study introduces a novel methodology called Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR) to accurately measure energy consumption across different components of the transformer architecture. The research evaluates 15 models representing various architecture types and reveals that Attention blocks consume more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP) than other components. This indicates that energy consumption is not directly proportional to FLOP counts. The findings highlight the importance of considering energy efficiency at a component level rather than just focusing on overall model metrics. By establishing detailed component-level energy baselines, the study aims to pave the way for optimizing transformer models for improved energy efficiency through targeted component-level optimizations. <div>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology, Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP), indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient transformer models through component-level optimizations.

<div> Keywords: supervised learning, spurious correlations, distribution shifts, Group DRO, minority groups

Summary:
Supervised learning methods often struggle with spurious correlations, especially when faced with distribution shifts in test data. Existing approaches like Group DRO are robust to subpopulation shifts but struggle with intra-group distributional shifts common in minority groups. This study introduces a hierarchical extension of Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties, providing robustness at multiple levels. Additionally, new benchmark settings simulate realistic minority group distribution shifts, a previously underexplored challenge in spurious correlation research. The proposed method shows strong robustness in these conditions where existing methods fail, while also outperforming on standard benchmarks. Broadening the ambiguity set to capture both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties is crucial for effectively combating distribution shifts in supervised learning.

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed. While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties, providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

<div> random-order model, online learning, regret guarantees, stochastic algorithms, non-stationarity

Summary:
In the random-order model for online learning, where losses are predetermined by an adversary before being presented in a random permutation to the learner, challenges arise due to non-stationarity. While random-order inputs are asymptotically similar to stochastic ones, they can affect the performance of stochastic learning algorithms for finite times. This paper introduces a method to adapt stochastic algorithms to the random-order model without compromising their regret guarantees, leading to improved bounds for prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with switching costs. Additionally, the study shows that in random order, the learnability of online classification is determined by VC dimension rather than the Littlestone dimension, highlighting a distinction from the general adversarial model. <div>

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically} equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that, in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general adversarial model.

<div> adaptive mixed-precision quantization, computer vision models, real-time workload fluctuations, FlexiQ, NPU <br />
Summary: 
FlexiQ is a novel adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme designed for computer vision models to address real-time workload fluctuations on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and GPUs. The scheme selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to feature channels with small value ranges and uses an efficient bit-lowering method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy. FlexiQ also adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time, allowing quantized models to effectively manage varying inference workloads. Experimental results show that FlexiQ outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization techniques, achieving on average 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning. Furthermore, mixed-precision models using FlexiQ demonstrate an efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with minimal runtime overhead on custom NPUs and GPUs, showcasing its hardware efficiency and overall performance benefits. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy. Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time, enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only 0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and overall performance benefits.

<div> Keywords: State Space Models, Control Theory, Hankel Singular Value Analysis, Training Optimization, Computational Efficiency

Summary: State Space Models (SSMs) are utilized for long sequence modeling tasks, offering parallelizable training and fast inference through recurrent dynamical systems maintaining a hidden state. A challenge lies in balancing expressivity and computational burden, which can be addressed using control theory, specifically Hankel singular value analysis. This framework measures energy for each state and enables balanced truncation for a smaller representation with performance guarantees. By leveraging the stability properties of Hankel matrices during training, high influence dimensions are identified and preserved, leading to accelerated optimization without sacrificing model expressivity. Experimental results demonstrate that compressing models during training results in computational efficiency while retaining task-critical structure often lost in models trained at smaller dimensions. Thus, SSMs that start large and shrink during training achieve both efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis, provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training, where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units, but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher performance.

<div> Keywords: Visual Autoregressive, iterative-refinement framework, denoising diffusion, spatial frequency, medium-range weather forecasting

Summary: 
The article proposes a new perspective on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models by framing them within an iterative-refinement framework. VAR is seen as a deterministic forward process that constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid and a learned backward process that reconstructs it in a few coarse-to-fine steps. Three key design choices are identified: refining in a learned latent space, using discrete classification for prediction, and partitioning by spatial frequency. Controlled experiments reveal the impact of each factor on fidelity and speed. The framework can be extended to graph generation and probabilistic weather forecasting. It also suggests ways for VAR to benefit from diffusion tools while maintaining efficient generation in few steps at different scales.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space, casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

<title>Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear Models for Interpretable Personalized Health Prediction from Multimodal Lifelog Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02835</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset -- which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

<title>Knowledge-Aware Modeling with Frequency Adaptive Learning for Battery Health Prognostics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics. Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness, generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management across diverse applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards, but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

arXiv:2510.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods. DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end (besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions. Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST database of gene interactions.

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter, emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers, demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical variable-length time series classification.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date, continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected (or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results, which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes), together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels (identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel, and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.

Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs. Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets, motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph -- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

<title>CHORD: Customizing Hybrid-precision On-device Model for Sequential Recommendation with Device-cloud Collaboration</title>

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation, stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose, pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to 20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining, we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model are available at: https://github.com/jamisonmeindl/zeroshotopt

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks, with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC) outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

<title>A Unified Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem</title>

arXiv:2510.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL) framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii). Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness to dynamic environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<title>Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies, ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful, computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&amp;P 100 equity data, SIT decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research, aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models. Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more suitable for real-world use cases.

arXiv:2510.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

arXiv:2510.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization. Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning depends on the number of experts.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

arXiv:2510.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory, energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers - demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes. These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting, such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

<title>Superposition disentanglement of neural representations reveals hidden alignment</title>

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics (semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment between neural codes.

<title>Estimation of Resistance Training RPE using Inertial Sensors and Electromyography</title>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000 repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy. While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges for improving model generalizability.

<title>Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently, evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses, and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with $k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM), with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is $O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$ is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound, certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

<title>To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially observable domains.

<title>Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs) match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning. The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for guiding future model development.

Abstract: The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models (AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data, struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted clinical analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases. Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis, precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand, audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/plumprc/RepT.

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor, Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/gxx27/time_unlearn.

<title>Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Abstract: This study examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) to improve access to legal texts in Senegal's judicial system. The emphasis is on the difficulties of extracting and organizing legal documents, highlighting the need for better access to judicial information. The research successfully extracted 7,967 articles from various legal documents, particularly focusing on the Land and Public Domain Code. A detailed graph database was developed, which contains 2,872 nodes and 10,774 relationships, aiding in the visualization of interconnections within legal texts. In addition, advanced triple extraction techniques were utilized for knowledge, demonstrating the effectiveness of models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4, and Mistral-Large in identifying relationships and relevant metadata. Through these technologies, the aim is to create a solid framework that allows Senegalese citizens and legal professionals to more effectively understand their rights and responsibilities.

arXiv:2510.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses, sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like "maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

arXiv:2510.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better. Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

Abstract: Leaderboards for LRMs have turned evaluation into a competition, incentivizing developers to optimize directly on benchmark suites. A shortcut to achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the training data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark contamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination detections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where contamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM via SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally identified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training can markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on. Further empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style importance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this detection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may inherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination with CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination detection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members, contaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those unseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus, evade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings reveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could easily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while leaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the fairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards. This underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods and trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs.

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM, to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further research on code world modeling, we release model checkpoints after mid-training, SFT, and RL.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent (Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

Abstract: Android malware continues to evolve through obfuscation and polymorphism, posing challenges for both signature-based defenses and machine learning models trained on limited and imbalanced datasets. Synthetic data has been proposed as a remedy for scarcity, yet the role of large language models (LLMs) in generating effective malware data for detection tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we fine-tune GPT-4.1-mini to produce structured records for three malware families: BankBot, Locker/SLocker, and Airpush/StopSMS, using the KronoDroid dataset. After addressing generation inconsistencies with prompt engineering and post-processing, we evaluate multiple classifiers under three settings: training with real data only, real-plus-synthetic data, and synthetic data alone. Results show that real-only training achieves near perfect detection, while augmentation with synthetic data preserves high performance with only minor degradations. In contrast, synthetic-only training produces mixed outcomes, with effectiveness varying across malware families and fine-tuning strategies. These findings suggest that LLM-generated malware can enhance scarce datasets without compromising detection accuracy, but remains insufficient as a standalone training source.

Abstract: Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs, can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning models for the global atmosphere that are capable of producing stable, multi-year simulations of Earth's climate have recently been developed. However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (GFDL's AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust out-of-sample generalization.

Abstract: DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline, NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

Abstract: This paper presents CADL (Cognitive-Adaptive Deception Layer), an adaptive deception framework achieving 99.88% detection rate with 0.13% false positive rate on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The framework employs ensemble machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) combined with behavioral profiling to identify and adapt responses to network intrusions. Through a coordinated signal bus architecture, security components share real-time intelligence, enabling collective decision-making. The system profiles attackers based on temporal patterns and deploys customized deception strategies across five escalation levels. Evaluation on 50,000 CICIDS2017 test samples demonstrates that CADL significantly outperforms traditional intrusion detection systems (Snort: 71.2%, Suricata: 68.5%) while maintaining production-ready false positive rates. The framework's behavioral analysis achieves 89% accuracy in classifying attacker profiles. We provide open-source implementation and transparent performance metrics, offering an accessible alternative to commercial deception platforms costing $150-400 per host annually.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

<title>Predictive inference for time series: why is split conformal effective despite temporal dependence?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for prediction in a time series: if we use past data to forecast the next time point, can we provide valid prediction intervals around our forecasts? To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.

<title>Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads</title>

Abstract: Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline ``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control (DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction, ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs. Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks with widespread applications across machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions, these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response distributions at the extreme tail conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages, arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many open questions.

Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads, termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in high-dimensional problems, outperforming models such as kernel methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, the theoretical foundations of this success remain poorly understood. We follow the idea that the compositional structure of the learning task is the key factor determining when deep networks outperform other approaches. Taking a step towards formalizing this idea, we consider a simple compositional model, namely the multi-index model (MIM). In this context, we introduce and study hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and kernel methods. Our main contribution is a sample complexity result demonstrating that HKRR can adaptively learn MIM, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Further, we exploit the kernel nature of the estimator to develop ad hoc optimization approaches. Indeed, we contrast alternating minimization and alternating gradient methods both theoretically and numerically. These numerical results complement and reinforce our theoretical findings.

Abstract: This paper studies the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) for linear algebraic tasks involving the kernel matrix of a collection of $n$ data points in $\mathbb R^d$. In particular, we improve upon existing algorithms for computing the following up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error: matrix-vector products, matrix-matrix products, the spectral norm, and sum of all entries. The runtimes of our algorithms depend on the dimension $d$, the number of points $n$, and the target error $\varepsilon$. Importantly, the dependence on $n$ in each case is far lower when accessing the kernel matrix through KDE queries as opposed to reading individual entries.
  Our improvements over existing best algorithms (particularly those of Backurs, Indyk, Musco, and Wagner '21) for these tasks reduce the polynomial dependence on $\varepsilon$, and additionally decreases the dependence on $n$ in the case of computing the sum of all entries of the kernel matrix.
  We complement our upper bounds with several lower bounds for related problems, which provide (conditional) quadratic time hardness results and additionally hint at the limits of KDE based approaches for the problems we study.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

<title>FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction</title>

Abstract: We present Flowr.root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, Flowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.

<title>On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.

<title>Uncertainty as Feature Gaps: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification of LLMs in Contextual Question-Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02671</link>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

<title>ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks</title>

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs (e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance- and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates, exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs. Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt, prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

<title>Quantitative Convergence Analysis of Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-Convex Losses via the Goldstein Subdifferential</title>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the main algorithm behind a large body of work in machine learning. In many cases, constraints are enforced via projections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent years, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of projected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. Strong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via Moreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work on unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the gradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation that convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as mini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD for non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the distance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the constraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly used criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without requiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent, identically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In these cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic bounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID sub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and high-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds. In particular, these are the first non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for projected SGD with non-convex losses.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However, most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts, but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we explore how Neural Jump ODEs (NJODEs) can be used as generative models for It\^o processes. Given (discrete observations of) samples of a fixed underlying It\^o process, the NJODE framework can be used to approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process. Under standard regularity assumptions on the It\^o processes, we prove that, in the limit, we recover the true parameters with our approximation. Hence, using these learned coefficients to sample from the corresponding It\^o process generates, in the limit, samples with the same law as the true underlying process. Compared to other generative machine learning models, our approach has the advantage that it does not need adversarial training and can be trained solely as a predictive model on the observed samples without the need to generate any samples during training to empirically approximate the distribution. Moreover, the NJODE framework naturally deals with irregularly sampled data with missing values as well as with path-dependent dynamics, allowing to apply this approach in real-world settings. In particular, in the case of path-dependent coefficients of the It\^o processes, the NJODE learns their optimal approximation given the past observations and therefore allows generating new paths conditionally on discrete, irregular, and incomplete past observations in an optimal way.

<title>Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology</title>

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple, detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages, and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language, such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order. However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are (almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than $t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

Abstract: To promote climate adaptation and mitigation, it is crucial to understand stakeholder perspectives and knowledge gaps on land use and climate changes. Stakeholders across 21 European islands were consulted on climate and land use change issues affecting ecosystem services. Climate change perceptions included temperature, precipitation, humidity, extremes, and wind. Land use change perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection, renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate between climate and land use impacts. Water, energy, and renewable energy issues pose serious concerns, requiring management measures.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed, with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152, DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

Abstract: Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.

Abstract: We propose SALSA-V, a multimodal video-to-audio generation model capable of synthesizing highly synchronized, high-fidelity long-form audio from silent video content. Our approach introduces a masked diffusion objective, enabling audio-conditioned generation and the seamless synthesis of audio sequences of unconstrained length. Additionally, by integrating a shortcut loss into our training process, we achieve rapid generation of high-quality audio samples in as few as eight sampling steps, paving the way for near-real-time applications without requiring dedicated fine-tuning or retraining. We demonstrate that SALSA-V significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both audiovisual alignment and synchronization with video content in quantitative evaluation and a human listening study. Furthermore, our use of random masking during training enables our model to match spectral characteristics of reference audio samples, broadening its applicability to professional audio synthesis tasks such as Foley generation and sound design.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications of quantum optimisation.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.

Abstract: We propose new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample a uniform distribution on a convex body $K$. Our algorithms are based on the Alternating Sampling Framework/proximal sampler, which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented distribution and assumes access to the so-called restricted Gaussian oracle (RGO). The key contribution of this work is the efficient implementation of RGO for uniform sampling on $K$ via rejection sampling and access to either a projection oracle or a separation oracle on $K$. In both oracle cases, we establish non-asymptotic complexities to obtain unbiased samples where the accuracy is measured in R\'enyi divergence or $\chi^2$-divergence.

Abstract: Transaction costs and regime shifts are major reasons why paper portfolios fail in live trading. We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned Learning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns after-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity regimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent execution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in the reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in inventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and (iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH states without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels with multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with narrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance slope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a given turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly positive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing corrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions, monotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and induced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for regime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The methodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity proxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures and tables are reproducible from released artifacts.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.

Abstract: We investigate the complexity of stable (or perturbation-resilient) instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$ and $\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ clustering problems in metrics with small doubling dimension. While these problems have been extensively studied under multiplicative perturbation resilience in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g., (Friggstad et al., 2019; Cohen-Addad and Schwiegelshohn, 2017)), we adopt a more general notion of stability, termed ``almost stable'', which is closer to the notion of $(\alpha, \varepsilon)$-perturbation resilience introduced by Balcan and Liang (2016). Additionally, we extend our results to $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ with penalties, where each data point is either assigned to a cluster centre or incurs a penalty.
  We show that certain special cases of almost stable $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties) are solvable in polynomial time. To complement this, we also examine the hardness of almost stable instances and $(1 + \frac{1}{poly(n)})$-stable instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties), proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the runtime of any exact algorithm under the widely believed Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of neuronal action potential (AP) onset timing is crucial for understanding neural coding of danger signals. Traditional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models, while widely used, exhibit high relative error in predicting AP onset latency, especially under strong or rapidly changing stimuli. Inspired by recent experimental findings and quantum theory, we present a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that treats AP onset as a probabilistic event, represented by a Gaussian wave packet in time. This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely with observed biological responses. This work highlights the potential of quantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural modeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to brain-inspired computing.

<title>Improving Online-to-Nonconvex Conversion for Smooth Optimization via Double Optimism</title>

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in nonconvex optimization is the online-to-nonconvex conversion framework of \cite{cutkosky2023optimal}, which reformulates the task of finding an $\varepsilon$-first-order stationary point as an online learning problem. When both the gradient and the Hessian are Lipschitz continuous, instantiating this framework with two different online learners achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ in the deterministic case and a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ in the stochastic case. However, this approach suffers from several limitations: (i) the deterministic method relies on a complex double-loop scheme that solves a fixed-point equation to construct hint vectors for an optimistic online learner, introducing an extra logarithmic factor; (ii) the stochastic method assumes a bounded second-order moment of the stochastic gradient, which is stronger than standard variance bounds; and (iii) different online learning algorithms are used in the two settings. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing an online optimistic gradient method based on a novel \textit{doubly optimistic hint function}. Specifically, we use the gradient at an extrapolated point as the hint, motivated by two optimistic assumptions: that the difference between the hint and the target gradient remains near constant, and that consecutive update directions change slowly due to smoothness. Our method eliminates the need for a double loop and removes the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, by simply replacing full gradients with stochastic gradients and under the standard assumption that their variance is bounded by $\sigma^2$, we obtain a unified algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \sigma^2 \varepsilon^{-3.5})$, smoothly interpolating between the best-known deterministic rate and the optimal stochastic rate.

Abstract: The increased use of software in the operation and management of telecommunication networks has moved the industry one step closer to realizing autonomous network operation. One consequence of this shift is the significantly increased need for testing and validation before such software can be deployed. Complementing existing simulation or hardware-based approaches, digital twins present an environment to achieve this testing; however, they require significant time and human effort to configure and execute. This paper explores the automatic generation of digital twins to provide efficient and accurate validation tools, aligned to the ITU-T autonomous network architecture's experimentation subsystem. We present experimental results for an initial use case, demonstrating that the approach is feasible in automatically creating efficient digital twins with sufficient accuracy to be included as part of existing validation pipelines.

Abstract: As renewable energy integration increases supply variability, battery energy storage systems (BESS) present a viable solution for balancing supply and demand. This paper proposes a novel approach for optimizing battery BESS participation in multiple electricity markets. We develop a joint bidding strategy that combines participation in the primary frequency reserve market with continuous trading in the intraday market, addressing a gap in the extant literature which typically considers these markets in isolation or simplifies the continuous nature of intraday trading. Our approach utilizes a mixed integer linear programming implementation of the rolling intrinsic algorithm for intraday decisions and state of charge recovery, alongside a learned classifier strategy (LCS) that determines optimal capacity allocation between markets. A comprehensive out-of-sample backtest over more than one year of historical German market data validates our approach: The LCS increases overall profits by over 4% compared to the best-performing static strategy and by more than 3% over a naive dynamic benchmark. Crucially, our method closes the gap to a theoretical perfect foresight strategy to just 4%, demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic, learning-based allocation in a complex, multi-market environment.

<title>Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks: imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of adversarial attacks.

Abstract: ML is playing an increasingly crucial role in estimating causal effects of treatments on outcomes from observational data. Many ML methods (`causal estimators') have been proposed for this task. All of these methods, as with any ML approach, require extensive hyperparameter tuning. For non-causal predictive tasks, there is a consensus on the choice of tuning metrics (e.g. mean squared error), making it simple to compare models. However, for causal inference tasks, such a consensus is yet to be reached, making any comparison of causal models difficult. On top of that, there is no ideal metric on which to tune causal estimators, so one must rely on proxies. Furthermore, the fact that model selection in causal inference involves multiple components (causal estimator, ML regressor, hyperparameters, metric), complicates the issue even further. In order to evaluate the importance of each component, we perform an extensive empirical study on their combination. Our experimental setup involves many commonly used causal estimators, regressors (`base learners' henceforth) and metrics applied to four well-known causal inference benchmark datasets. Our results show that hyperparameter tuning increased the probability of reaching state-of-the-art performance in average ($65\% {\rightarrow} 81\%$) and individualised ($50\% {\rightarrow} 57\%$) effect estimation with only commonly used estimators. We also show that the performance of standard metrics can be inconsistent across different scenarios. Our findings highlight the need for further research to establish whether metrics uniformly capable of state-of-the-art performance in causal model evaluation can be found.

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation dilemma has been a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) with complex model classes. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Monotonic Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bound (MQL-UCB) for RL with general function approximation. Our key algorithmic design includes (1) a general deterministic policy-switching strategy that achieves low switching cost, (2) a monotonic value function structure with carefully controlled function class complexity, and (3) a variance-weighted regression scheme that exploits historical trajectories with high data efficiency. MQL-UCB achieves minimax optimal regret of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{HK})$ when $K$ is sufficiently large and near-optimal policy switching cost of $\tilde{O}(dH)$, with $d$ being the eluder dimension of the function class, $H$ being the planning horizon, and $K$ being the number of episodes.
  Our work sheds light on designing provably sample-efficient and deployment-efficient Q-learning with nonlinear function approximation.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is increasingly attractive for pre-training encoders without requiring labeled data. Downstream tasks built on top of those pre-trained encoders can achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance. The pre-trained encoders by SSL, however, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as demonstrated by existing studies. Numerous backdoor mitigation techniques are designed for downstream task models. However, their effectiveness is impaired and limited when adapted to pre-trained encoders, due to the lack of label information when pre-training. To address backdoor attacks against pre-trained encoders, in this paper, we innovatively propose a mutual information guided backdoor mitigation technique, named MIMIC. MIMIC treats the potentially backdoored encoder as the teacher net and employs knowledge distillation to distill a clean student encoder from the teacher net. Different from existing knowledge distillation approaches, MIMIC initializes the student with random weights, inheriting no backdoors from teacher nets. Then MIMIC leverages mutual information between each layer and extracted features to locate where benign knowledge lies in the teacher net, with which distillation is deployed to clone clean features from teacher to student. We craft the distillation loss with two aspects, including clone loss and attention loss, aiming to mitigate backdoors and maintain encoder performance at the same time. Our evaluation conducted on two backdoor attacks in SSL demonstrates that MIMIC can significantly reduce the attack success rate by only utilizing <5% of clean data, surpassing seven state-of-the-art backdoor mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Demand for air travel is rising, straining existing aviation infrastructure. In the US, more than 90% of airport control towers are understaffed, falling short of FAA and union standards. This, in part, has contributed to an uptick in near-misses and safety-critical events, highlighting the need for advancements in air traffic management technologies to ensure safe and efficient operations. Data-driven predictive models for terminal airspace show potential to address these challenges; however, the lack of large-scale surface movement datasets in the public domain has hindered the development of scalable and generalizable approaches. To address this, we introduce Amelia-42, a first-of-its-kind large collection of raw airport surface movement reports streamed through the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program, comprising over two years of trajectory data (~9.19 TB) across 42 US airports. We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/youngsheen/SimVQ.

Abstract: We present an estimate of the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generation of score-based generative models. The sampling complexity with respect to dimension is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$, with a logarithmic constant. In the analysis, we assume a Gaussian-type tail behavior of the data distribution and an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation of the score. Such a Gaussian tail assumption is general, as it accommodates a practical target - the distribution from early stopping techniques with bounded support.
  The crux of the analysis lies in the global Lipschitz bound of the score, which is shown from the Gaussian tail assumption by a dimension-independent estimate of the heat kernel. Consequently, our complexity bound scales linearly (up to a logarithmic constant) with the square root of the trace of the covariance operator, which relates to the invariant distribution of the forward process.

Abstract: Factors such as the proliferation of renewable energy and electrification contribute to grid congestion as a pressing problem. Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has been explored to address client heterogeneity, with Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) treating each client as a distinct task. However, most existing research focuses on data heterogeneity (e.g., addressing non-IID data) rather than task heterogeneity, where clients solve fundamentally different tasks. Additionally, much of the work relies on centralized settings with a server managing the federation, leaving the more challenging domain of decentralized FMTL largely unexplored. Thus, this work bridges this gap by proposing ColNet, a framework designed for heterogeneous tasks in decentralized federated environments.
  ColNet partitions models into a backbone and task-specific heads, and uses adaptive clustering based on model and data sensitivity to form task-coherent client groups. Backbones are averaged within groups, and group leaders perform hyper-conflict-averse cross-group aggregation. Across datasets and federations, ColNet outperforms competing schemes under label and task heterogeneity and shows robustness to poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference aims to estimate the counterfactual outcome at the individual level given knowledge of an observed treatment and the factual outcome, with broad applications in fields such as epidemiology, econometrics, and management science. Previous methods rely on a known structural causal model (SCM) or assume the homogeneity of the exogenous variable and strict monotonicity between the outcome and exogenous variable. In this paper, we propose a principled approach for identifying and estimating the counterfactual outcome. We first introduce a simple and intuitive rank preservation assumption to identify the counterfactual outcome without relying on a known structural causal model. Building on this, we propose a novel ideal loss for theoretically unbiased learning of the counterfactual outcome and further develop a kernel-based estimator for its empirical estimation. Our theoretical analysis shows that the rank preservation assumption is not stronger than the homogeneity and strict monotonicity assumptions, and shows that the proposed ideal loss is convex, and the proposed estimator is unbiased. Extensive semi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling inference is key to unlocking greater performance, and leveraging diversity has proven an effective way to enhance it. Motivated by the observed relationship between solution accuracy and meaningful response diversity, we systematically study the effect of prompt diversity in scaling inference. We theoretically explain why diversified sampling improves Best-of-$N$ scaling, showing that responses generated from meaningful diverse prompts after Best-of-$N$ selection exhibit significantly lower error rates than those produced from stationary prompts. To promote solution diversity, we analyze perturbation fidelity and show that moderately relevant perturbations improve performance, providing guidance for effective perturbation design. Further, we present a set of effective perturbations, including task-level and query-level ones, and analyze the conditions under which they succeed. We systematically evaluate diversified sampling across tasks, finding relative gains of 10.8% in EM@100 for reasoning, 9.6% for mathematics, and 9.5% in Pass@100 for code generation.

Abstract: The proliferation of text-to-image diffusion models has raised significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the generation of copyrighted or harmful images. In response, concept erasure (defense) methods have been developed to "unlearn" specific concepts through post-hoc finetuning. However, recent concept restoration (attack) methods have demonstrated that these supposedly erased concepts can be recovered using adversarially crafted prompts, revealing a critical vulnerability in current defense mechanisms. In this work, we first investigate the fundamental sources of adversarial vulnerability and reveal that vulnerabilities are pervasive in the prompt embedding space of concept-erased models, a characteristic inherited from the original pre-unlearned model. Furthermore, we introduce **RECORD**, a novel coordinate-descent-based restoration algorithm that consistently outperforms existing restoration methods by up to 17.8 times. We conduct extensive experiments to assess its compute-performance tradeoff and propose acceleration strategies.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning extends to the critical dimension of privacy, particularly in human-centric federated learning (FL) settings where decentralized data necessitates an equitable distribution of privacy risk across clients. This paper introduces FinP, a novel framework specifically designed to address disparities in privacy risk by mitigating disproportionate vulnerability to source inference attacks (SIA). FinP employs a two-pronged strategy: (1) server-side adaptive aggregation, which dynamically adjusts client contributions to the global model to foster fairness, and (2) client-side regularization, which enhances the privacy robustness of individual clients. This comprehensive approach directly tackles both the symptoms and underlying causes of privacy unfairness in FL. Extensive evaluations on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate FinP's effectiveness, achieving improvement in fairness-in-privacy on HAR and CIFAR-10 with minimal impact on utility. FinP improved group fairness with respect to disparity in privacy risk using equal opportunity in CIFAR-10 by 57.14% compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, FinP significantly mitigates SIA risks on CIFAR-10, underscoring its potential to establish fairness in privacy within FL systems without compromising utility.

<title>A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation</title>

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild--moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.

Abstract: Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.

<title>To Backtrack or Not to Backtrack: When Sequential Search Limits Model Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test time-compute: parallel sampling with best-of-N selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling-especially under a fixed compute budget-remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models intro suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage implicit (non verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.

<title>Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence after the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the prior keys and values. This enables building what we call intrinsics, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while significantly improving inference efficiency. We contributed our Activated LoRA implementation to the Huggingface PEFT library https://github.com/huggingface/peft.

<title>DualRAG: A Dual-Process Approach to Integrate Reasoning and Retrieval for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications, posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. These results establish DualRAG as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where neural dynamics are critical to how brains process information. Most artificial neural networks ignore the complexity of individual neurons. We challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process incoming histories; and (2) neural synchronization as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between neuron abstractions and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. We demonstrate the CTM's performance and versatility across a range of tasks, including solving 2D mazes, ImageNet-1K classification, parity computation, and more. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems. We provide an accompanying interactive online demonstration at https://pub.sakana.ai/ctm/ and an extended technical report at https://pub.sakana.ai/ctm/paper .

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making settings. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&amp;E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiments introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&amp;E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&amp;E strategies of the agents and investigate how enabling thinking traces, through both prompting strategies and thinking models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that enabling thinking in LLMs shifts their behavior toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In a simple stationary setting, thinking-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas for improvement.

Abstract: We address the computational and theoretical limitations of current distributional alignment methods for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA). In particular, we focus on estimating classification performance and confidence in the absence of target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable and theoretically rigorous. It provides principled uncertainty estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that OT score outperforms existing confidence scores. Moreover, it improves SFUDA performance through training-time reweighting and provides a reliable, label-free proxy for model performance.

Abstract: As the default optimizer for training large language models, AdamW has achieved remarkable success in deep learning. However, its convergence behavior is not theoretically well-understood. This paper establishes the convergence rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[||\nabla f(x^k)||_1\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$ for AdamW measured by $\ell_1$ norm, where $K$ represents the iteration number, $d$ denotes the model dimension, and $C$ matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we have $||\nabla f(x)||_2\ll ||\nabla f(x)||_1\leq \sqrt{d}||\nabla f(x)||_2$ for any high-dimensional vector $x$ and $E\left[||\nabla f(x)||_1\right]\geq\sqrt{\frac{2d}{\pi}}E\left[||\nabla f(x)||_2\right]$ when each element of $\nabla f(x)$ is generated from Gaussian distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. Empirically, our experimental results on real-world deep learning tasks reveal $||\nabla f(x)||_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d})||\nabla f(x)||_2$. Both support that our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[||\nabla f(x^k)||_2\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD in the ideal case. We also extend our result to NAdamW, an AdamW variant that employs a double-momentum mechanism, and demonstrate that it maintains the same convergence rate.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However, existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel reward model framework for RL-based Text-to-SQL named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals while significantly reducing time cost and GPU memory usage. Building on this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE) subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and readability of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks, including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing reward models.

Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly detector, primarily owing to its remarkable runtime efficiency and superior performance in large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper focuses on the inductive bias of iForest, which theoretically elucidates under what circumstances and to what extent iForest works well. The key is to formulate the growth process of iForest, where the split dimensions and split values are randomly selected. We model the growth process of iForest as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function, which is the outcome of iForest, using transition probabilities. The case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor. Our study provides a theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks. Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. However, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging for online learning because the objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it differentiable and (ii) use perturbation techniques along with a near-optimal oracle to overcome non-convexity. Combining those techniques yields two original online algorithms tailored for DFL, for which we establish respectively static and dynamic regret bounds. These are the first provable guarantees for the online decision-focused problem. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our algorithms on a knapsack experiment, where they outperform two standard benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.

A challenging real-world use case is "patch attacks", where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for example, traffic signs. A significant step towards certification against patch attacks was recently achieved using PREMAP, which uses under- and over-approximations of the preimage, the set of inputs that lead to a specified output, for the certification. While the PREMAP approach is versatile, it is currently limited to fully-connected neural networks of moderate dimensionality. In order to tackle broader real-world use cases, we present novel algorithmic extensions to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved branching heuristics. Firstly, we demonstrate that these efficiency improvements significantly outperform the original PREMAP and enable scaling to convolutional neural networks that were previously intractable. Secondly, we showcase the potential of preimage approximation methodology for analysing and certifying reliability and robustness on a range of use cases from computer vision and control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM. We have released our model, training code, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

Abstract: Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, E(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an E(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized AI agents to complete them. We formalize agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs, called agent graphs, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. Real-world deployment requires selecting agent compositions that not only maximize task success but also minimize violations of safety, fairness, and privacy requirements which demands a careful analysis of the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions and seek to minimize the value-at-risk of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies violations of these requirements. We introduce an efficient algorithm which traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents. It uses a dynamic programming approach to approximate the value-at-risk of agent compositions by exploiting a union bound. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching, enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences. Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: Generative models have recently been explored for synthesizing neural network weights. These approaches take neural network checkpoints as training data and aim to generate high-performing weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative, well-known methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Contrary to claims in prior work, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or, at best, simple interpolations of the training checkpoints. Moreover, they fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. Our further analysis suggests that this memorization might result from limited data, overparameterized models, and the underuse of structural priors specific to weight data. These findings highlight the need for more careful design and rigorous evaluation of generative models when applied to new domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/boyazeng/weight_memorization.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation requires storing activations throughout all layers, creating memory bottlenecks that limit model scalability. Existing block-wise training methods offer means to alleviate this problem, but they rely on ad-hoc local objectives and remain largely unexplored beyond classification tasks. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Abstract: Associative Memories like the famous Hopfield Networks are elegant models for describing fully recurrent neural networks whose fundamental job is to store and retrieve information. In the past few years they experienced a surge of interest due to novel theoretical results pertaining to their information storage capabilities, and their relationship with SOTA AI architectures, such as Transformers and Diffusion Models. These connections open up possibilities for interpreting the computation of traditional AI networks through the theoretical lens of Associative Memories. Additionally, novel Lagrangian formulations of these networks make it possible to design powerful distributed models that learn useful representations and inform the design of novel architectures. This tutorial provides an approachable introduction to Associative Memories, emphasizing the modern language and methods used in this area of research, with practical hands-on mathematical derivations and coding notebooks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for complex reasoning tasks with clear correctness signals such as math and coding. However, extending it to real-world reasoning tasks is challenging, as evaluation depends on nuanced, multi-criteria judgments rather than binary correctness. Instance-specific rubrics have recently been used in evaluation benchmarks to capture such judgments, but their potential as reward signals for on-policy post-training remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), an on-policy reinforcement learning method that extends RLVR beyond verifiable domains by using rubric-based feedback. Across both medical and science domains, we evaluate multiple strategies for aggregating rubric feedback into rewards. The best RaR variant achieves relative improvements of up to $31\%$ on HealthBench and $7\%$ on GPQA-Diamond over popular LLM-as-judge baselines that rely on direct Likert-based rewards. These results demonstrate that RaR-trained policies adapt well to diverse evaluation formats, performing strongly on both rubric-based and multiple-choice tasks. Moreover, we find that using rubrics as structured reward signals yields better alignment for smaller judges and reduces performance variance across judge scales.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), its reliance on human-annotated labels leads to the scaling up dilemma, especially for complex tasks. Recent self-rewarding methods investigate a label-free alternative to unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, yet they frequently encounter the non-negligible training collapse issue, as the single-view supervision signal easily forms the self-consistent illusion, yielding the reward hacking. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-rewarding}, a novel self-supervised RL framework that improves training stability by seeking complementary supervision from another views. Specifically, we instantiate Co-rewarding in two ways: (1) \textit{Co-rewarding-I} is a data-side instantiation that derives reward signals from contrastive agreement across semantically analogous questions; and (2) \textit{Co-rewarding-II} is a model-side instantiation that maintains a slowly-updated reference teacher with pseudo labels to realize self-distillation. Intuitively, such instantiations introduce different levels of discrepancy to increase the difficulty of training collapse on trivial reasoning solutions. Empirically, Co-rewarding exhibits stable training across various setups, and outperforms other self-rewarding baselines by $+3.31\%$ improvements on average on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, especially by $+7.49\%$ on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Notably, Co-rewarding reaches or even surpasses RLVR with ground-truth (GT) label in several cases, such as a Pass@$1$ of $94.01\%$ on GSM8K with Qwen3-8B-Base remarkably higher than GT. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-rewarding.

<title>Injecting Measurement Information Yields a Fast and Noise-Robust Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solver</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample $\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler, resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across multiple datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have achieved impressive performance on simulated benchmarks such as Atari100k, yet recent advances remain largely confined to simulation and show limited transfer to real-world domains. A central obstacle is environmental stochasticity, as real systems involve noisy observations, unpredictable dynamics, and non-stationary conditions that undermine the stability of current methods. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these uncertainties and favor simplified settings where algorithms can be tuned to succeed. The absence of a well-defined taxonomy of stochasticity further complicates evaluation, as robustness to one type of stochastic perturbation, such as sticky actions, does not guarantee robustness to other forms of uncertainty. To address this critical gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that systematically incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous evaluation of RL techniques under different forms of uncertainty. We propose a comprehensive five-type taxonomy of environmental stochasticity and demonstrate systematic vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms through targeted evaluation of DreamerV3 and STORM. Our findings reveal that world models dramatically underestimate environmental variance, struggle with action corruption, and exhibit unreliable dynamics under partial observability. We release the code and benchmark publicly at https://github.com/ARY2260/stori, providing a unified framework for developing more robust RL systems.

Abstract: We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace. Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones. This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability. Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are routinely used for business decisions that may directly affect individuals, for example, because a credit scoring algorithm refuses them a loan. It is then relevant from an ethical (and legal) point of view to ensure that these algorithms do not discriminate based on sensitive attributes (like sex or race), which may occur unwittingly and unknowingly by the operator and the management. Statistical tools and methods are then required to detect and eliminate such potential biases.

Abstract: We study estimation and inference using data collected by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms adaptively experiment by interacting with individual units over multiple stages, updating their strategies based on past outcomes. Our goal is to evaluate a counterfactual policy after data collection and estimate structural parameters, such as dynamic treatment effects, that support credit assignment and quantify the impact of early actions on final outcomes. These parameters can often be defined as solutions to moment equations, motivating moment-based estimation methods developed for static data. In RL settings, however, data are often collected adaptively under nonstationary behavior policies. As a result, standard estimators fail to achieve asymptotic normality due to time-varying variance. We propose a weighted generalized method of moments (GMM) approach that uses adaptive weights to stabilize this variance. We characterize weighting schemes that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted GMM estimators, enabling valid hypothesis testing and uniform confidence region construction. Key applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic off-policy evaluation.

Abstract: High-probability guarantees in stochastic optimization are often obtained only under strong noise assumptions such as sub-Gaussian tails. We show that such guarantees can also be achieved under the weaker assumption of bounded variance by developing a stochastic proximal point method. This method combines a proximal subproblem solver, which inherently reduces variance, with a probability booster that amplifies per-iteration reliability into high-confidence results. The analysis demonstrates convergence with low sample complexity, without restrictive noise assumptions or reliance on mini-batching.

Abstract: We study nonparametric contextual bandits under batch constraints, where the expected reward for each action is modeled as a smooth function of covariates, and the policy updates are made at the end of each batch of observations. We establish a minimax regret lower bound for this setting and propose a novel batch learning algorithm that achieves the optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors). In essence, our procedure dynamically splits the covariate space into smaller bins, carefully aligning their widths with the batch size. Our theoretical results suggest that for nonparametric contextual bandits, a nearly constant number of policy updates can attain optimal regret in the fully online setting.

<title>Understanding How CodeLLMs (Mis)Predict Types with Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used by software engineers for programming tasks. However, research shows that LLMs often lack a deep understanding of program semantics. Even minor changes to syntax, such as renaming variables, can significantly degrade performance across various tasks. In this work, we examine the task of type prediction: given a partially typed program, can a model predict a missing type annotations such that the resulting program is more typed? We construct a dataset of adversarial examples where models initially predict the correct types, but begin to fail after semantically irrelevant edits. This is problematic, as models should ideally generalize across different syntactic forms of semantically equivalent code. This lack of robustness suggests that models may have a shallow understanding of code semantics. Despite this, we provide evidence that LLMs do, in fact, learn robust mechanisms for type prediction-though these mechanisms often fail to activate in adversarial scenarios. By using activation steering, a method that manipulates a model's internal activations to guide it toward using latent knowledge, we restore accurate predictions on adversarial inputs. We show that steering successfully activates a type prediction mechanism that is shared by both Python and TypeScript, and is more effective than prompting with in-context examples. Across five different models, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that LLMs can learn generalizable representations of code semantics that transfer across programming languages.

arXiv:2404.09113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) has emerged as a popular method for approximate inference for high-dimensional Bayesian models. In this paper, we propose a novel VI method that extends the naive mean field via entropic regularization, referred to as $\Xi$-variational inference ($\Xi$-VI). $\Xi$-VI has a close connection to the entropic optimal transport problem and benefits from the computationally efficient Sinkhorn algorithm. We show that $\Xi$-variational posteriors effectively recover the true posterior dependency, where the dependence is downweighted by the regularization parameter. We analyze the role of dimensionality of the parameter space on the accuracy of $\Xi$-variational approximation and how it affects computational considerations, providing a rough characterization of the statistical-computational trade-off in $\Xi$-VI. We also investigate the frequentist properties of $\Xi$-VI and establish results on consistency, asymptotic normality, high-dimensional asymptotics, and algorithmic stability. We provide sufficient criteria for achieving polynomial-time approximate inference using the method. Finally, we demonstrate the practical advantage of $\Xi$-VI over mean-field variational inference on simulated and real data.

<title>Improved Monte Carlo Planning via Causal Disentanglement for Structurally-Decomposed Markov Decision Processes</title>

arXiv:2406.16151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), as a general-purpose framework, often overlook the benefits of incorporating the causal structure of the transition and reward dynamics. For a subclass of resource allocation problems, we introduce the Structurally Decomposed MDP (SD-MDP), which leverages causal disentanglement to partition an MDP's temporal causal graph into independent components. By exploiting this disentanglement, SD-MDP enables dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency gains in optimal value function estimation. We reduce the sequential optimization problem to a fractional knapsack problem with log-linear complexity $O(T \log T)$, outperforming traditional stochastic programming methods that exhibit polynomial complexity with respect to the time horizon $T$. Additionally, SD-MDP's computational advantages are independent of state-action space size, making it viable for high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, our approach integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), achieving higher expected rewards under constrained simulation budgets while providing a vanishing simple regret bound. Empirical results demonstrate superior policy performance over benchmarks across various logistics and finance domains.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, arguably one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, for the task of estimating the parameters of the optimal linear approximation to the value function. Assuming independent samples, we make three theoretical contributions that improve upon the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantees that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those adopted in the literature; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than the best known results, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

arXiv:2412.05788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, new proteins can be generated at an unprecedented rate. The motif scaffolding problem requires steering this generative process to yield proteins with a desirable functional substructure called a motif. While models have been trained to take the motif as conditional input, recent techniques in diffusion posterior sampling can be leveraged as zero-shot alternatives whose approximations can be corrected with sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new set of guidance potentials for describing scaffolding tasks and solve them by adapting SMC-aided diffusion posterior samplers with an unconditional model, Genie, as a prior. In single motif problems, we find that (i) the proposed potentials perform comparably, if not better, than the conventional masking approach, (ii) samplers based on reconstruction guidance outperform their replacement method counterparts, and (iii) measurement tilted proposals and twisted targets improve performance substantially. Furthermore, as a demonstration, we provide solutions to two multi-motif problems by pairing reconstruction guidance with an SE(3)-invariant potential. We also produce designable internally symmetric monomers with a guidance potential for point symmetry constraints. Our code is available at: https://github.com/matsagad/mres-project.

<title>PrisonBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with at Most Twenty-Five Targeted Bit-flips</title>

arXiv:2412.07192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new vulnerability in commercial-scale safety-aligned large language models (LLMs): their refusal to generate harmful responses can be broken by flipping only a few bits in model parameters. Our attack jailbreaks billion-parameter language models with just 5 to 25 bit-flips, requiring up to 40$\times$ fewer bit flips than prior attacks on much smaller computer vision models. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our method directly uncensors models in memory at runtime, enabling harmful outputs without requiring input-level modifications. Our key innovation is an efficient bit-selection algorithm that identifies critical bits for language model jailbreaks up to 20$\times$ faster than prior methods.
  We evaluate our attack on 10 open-source LLMs, achieving high attack success rates (ASRs) of 80-98% with minimal impact on model utility. We further demonstrate an end-to-end exploit via Rowhammer-based fault injection, reliably jailbreaking 5 models (69-91% ASR) on a GDDR6 GPU. Our analyses reveal that: (1) models with weaker post-training alignment require fewer bit-flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, e.g., value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable; and (3) the attack is mechanistically different from existing jailbreak methods. We evaluate potential countermeasures and find that our attack remains effective against defenses at various stages of the LLM pipeline.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold the promise of performing a wide variety of general tasks, but current evaluations have primarily focused on simple scenarios. It therefore remains unclear whether such generalist agents can automate more sophisticated and specialized work such as software engineering (SWE). To investigate this, we introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), the first comprehensive computer-use environment for software engineering, where agents visually control an IDE to perform diverse software engineering tasks. To enable holistic evaluation, we also introduce \texttt{PwP-Bench}, a benchmark of 15 existing and new software-engineering tasks spanning multiple modalities, programming languages, and skillsets. We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-weight and closed-weight CUAs and find that when interacting purely visually, they perform significantly worse than specialized coding agents. However, when the same CUAs are given direct access to just two APIs-file editing and bash operations-performance jumps, often reaching the levels of specialized agents despite having a task-agnostic design. Furthermore, when given access to additional IDE tools via text APIs, all models show further gains. Our analysis shows that current CUAs fall short mainly due to limited visual grounding and the inability to take full advantage of the rich environment, leaving clear room for future improvements.PwP establishes software engineering as a natural domain for benchmarking whether generalist computer-use agents can reach specialist-level performance on sophisticated tasks.

arXiv:2502.20215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel topology-aware dimensionality reduction approach aiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic patterns present in high dimensional data. To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders (TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for $d\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for the accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions. Our C++ implementation is available at https://github.com/MClemot/TopologicalAutoencodersPlusPlus.

Abstract: Aligning a lens system relative to an imager is a critical challenge in camera manufacturing. While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by ``thinking longer''-that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. Specifically, using LCPO we derive Short Reasoning Models (SRMs), that exhibit similar reasoning patterns as full-length reasoning models, but can generate CoT lengths comparable to non-reasoning models. They demonstrate significant performance gains, for instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy. We release code and models at https://www.cmu-l3.github.io/l1

Abstract: With high-stakes machine learning applications increasingly moving to untrusted end-user or cloud environments, safeguarding pre-trained model parameters becomes essential for protecting intellectual property and user privacy. Recent advancements in hardware-isolated enclaves, notably Intel SGX, hold the promise to secure the internal state of machine learning applications even against compromised operating systems. However, we show that privileged software adversaries can exploit input-dependent memory access patterns in common neural network activation functions to extract secret weights and biases from an SGX enclave.
  Our attack leverages the SGX-Step framework to obtain a noise-free, instruction-granular page-access trace. In a case study of an 11-input regression network using the Tensorflow Microlite library, we demonstrate complete recovery of all first-layer weights and biases, as well as partial recovery of parameters from deeper layers under specific conditions. Our novel attack technique requires only 20 queries per input per weight to obtain all first-layer weights and biases with an average absolute error of less than 1%, improving over prior model stealing attacks.
  Additionally, a broader ecosystem analysis reveals the widespread use of activation functions with input-dependent memory access patterns in popular machine learning frameworks (either directly or via underlying math libraries). Our findings highlight the limitations of deploying confidential models in SGX enclaves and emphasise the need for stricter side-channel validation of machine learning implementations, akin to the vetting efforts applied to secure cryptographic libraries.

arXiv:2504.06316v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 14.69%, 22.52%, and 13.03% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. In response to this, LLM Jailbreaking is a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated its effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing jailbreak proposals mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted jailbreak attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits these unique patterns to break the security constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our attack.

Abstract: The present paper solves the problem of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic and intrinsic way from time correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al, 2025, on global Fr\'echet functional regression in manifolds). The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time-varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal eigenfunction basis in the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The finite sample size performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic local functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. As motivating real data application, we consider the prediction problem of the Earth's magnetic field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft.

Abstract: The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.

Abstract: We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern random spherical field.

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes--both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We introduce Limited Memory Language Models (LMLM), a new class of language models that externalizes factual knowledge to external database during pre-training rather than memorizing them. Our pre-training approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases.

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches fall into post-training binarization, which is simple but causes severe performance loss, and training-aware methods, which depend on full-precision latent weights, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. We propose a novel framework that represents LLMs with multi-kernel Boolean parameters and, for the first time, enables direct finetuning LMMs in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for latent weights. This enhances representational capacity and dramatically reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs show our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization techniques.

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on five public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, WMDP, and PubMedQA), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action segmentation methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HopaDIFF.

Abstract: Semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than raw input symbol sequences. Task-oriented semantic communication is a variant that tries to retains only task-specific information, thus achieving greater bandwidth savings. However, these neural-based communication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks, where adversaries try to infer sensitive input information from eavesdropped transmitted data. The key challenge, therefore, lies in preserving privacy while ensuring transmission correctness and robustness. While prior studies typically assume that adversaries aim to fully reconstruct the raw input in task-oriented settings, there exist scenarios where pixel-level metrics such as PSNR or SSIM are low, yet the adversary's outputs still suffice to accomplish the downstream task, indicating leakage of sensitive information. We therefore adopt the attacker's task accuracy as a more appropriate metric for evaluating attack effectiveness. To optimize the gap between the legitimate receiver's accuracy and the adversary's accuracy, we propose DiffSem, a diffusion-aided framework for task-oriented semantic communication. DiffSem integrates a transmitter-side self-noising mechanism that adaptively regulates semantic content while compensating for channel noise, and a receiver-side diffusion U-Net that enhances task performance and can be optionally strengthened by self-referential label embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffSem enables the legitimate receiver to achieve higher accuracy, thereby validating the superior performance of the proposed framework.

<title>Preconditioned subgradient method for composite optimization: overparameterization and fast convergence</title>

arXiv:2509.11486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite optimization problems involve minimizing the composition of a smooth map with a convex function. Such objectives arise in numerous data science and signal processing applications, including phase retrieval, blind deconvolution, and collaborative filtering. The subgradient method achieves local linear convergence when the composite loss is well-conditioned. However, if the smooth map is, in a certain sense, ill-conditioned or overparameterized, the subgradient method exhibits much slower sublinear convergence even when the convex function is well-conditioned. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Levenberg-Morrison-Marquardt subgradient method that converges linearly under mild regularity conditions at a rate determined solely by the convex function. Further, we demonstrate that these regularity conditions hold for several problems of practical interest, including square-variable formulations, matrix sensing, and tensor factorization. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of our method.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/DR-MoE.

<title>Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.

<title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>

Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of McTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may incorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not respected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.

arXiv:2509.21634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.

Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. Fed-Span aims to address critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span leverages minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies to introduce spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for Fed-Span, accommodating its key system characteristics and degrees of freedom (i.e., tunable parameters). Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.

This article presents $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) in reinforcement learning, without the requirement of linearly independent features. The convergence rates are established for both discounted and average-reward settings. The study does not involve any algorithmic modifications or additional assumptions. To handle the potential non-uniqueness of solutions due to arbitrary features, a stochastic approximation result is developed, focusing on convergence rates to the solution set rather than a single point. <div>

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.

<div> Variational Sparse Autoencoder, SAE architectures, interpretability, feature organization, Gaussian posteriors <br />
Summary: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a method for learning human-interpretable features from neural network representations. The Variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE) incorporates variational methods by using stochastic sampling from Gaussian posteriors and KL divergence regularization. This allows for more coherent feature organization in the latent space and aids in avoiding feature overlap. Evaluation of the vSAE against a standard SAE on transformer residual stream activations shows that while the vSAE performs well in feature independence and ablation metrics, it underperforms in core evaluation metrics. The excessive regularization pressure created by the KL divergence term leads to a decrease in the fraction of living features, resulting in observed performance degradation. While vSAE features show improved robustness, they also exhibit a higher number of dead features compared to the baseline. This study indicates that simply adding variational methods to SAEs may not enhance feature organization or interpretability.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse, human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature organization and interpretability. We introduce the Variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We evaluate a TopK vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual stream activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench, individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness, they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.

Summary: 
This study investigates the impact of optimizer choice on model performance in the context of quantization. The researchers trained models with various optimizers and quantized them using post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). They found that traditional outlier-related metrics were not effective in predicting PTQ performance due to their focus on isolated errors rather than error accumulation. Optimal optimizers for pretraining may not remain optimal under QAT, with Shampoo showing the lowest accuracy degradation. Scaling laws for QAT indicated that Shampoo was the most parameter-efficient optimizer. These findings highlight the importance of considering optimizer choice when deploying quantized models for efficient performance. 
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio (MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

SKETCHLORD is a new method introduced to estimate both low-rank and diagonal components simultaneously for a broader class of linear operators known as Low-Rank plus Diagonal (LoRD). This approach, targeting tasks in machine learning and scientific computing, outperforms any sequential variant method in terms of accuracy. By casting the problem as a convex optimization one, SKETCHLORD becomes a scalable algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic LoRD matrices show that it successfully recovers these structures. This makes SKETCHLORD a valuable tool in structured approximation for large-scale operators like the deep learning Hessian. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank *and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus* Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant (diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the deep learning Hessian.

IndexNet is a novel framework for multivariate time series forecasting that incorporates index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, to enhance forecasting accuracy. The framework utilizes an Index Embedding module, which includes Timestamp Embedding to capture long-term complex patterns and Channel Embedding to differentiate between variables. By doing so, IndexNet improves the model's ability to handle heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that IndexNet performs comparably to existing methods while also demonstrating strong generality and interpretability. The framework's design allows for interpretable results and robust performance, making it a promising approach for MTSF applications. Overall, IndexNet's innovative use of index-related information enhances forecasting accuracy and contributes to the advancement of multivariate time series forecasting techniques.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.

Summary: 
Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for understanding atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, limiting the feasibility of long-term simulations. This study introduces a novel approach that treats MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, using advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories through displacements rather than absolute positions. By incorporating a physics-informed loss and inference mechanism based on DFT-parameterized pair-wise Morse potential functions, the method penalizes unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical plausibility.

Summary:
The article introduces selective sampling, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric to improve the quality-diversity trade-off in language models. The research highlights that high-temperature sampling can lead to inaccuracies in sensitive decoding positions for tasks requiring precision, such as mathematical reasoning. By estimating the likelihood of errors through a sampling risk metric, a lightweight classifier is trained on verifiable problems to predict the sampling risk. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that selective sampling enhances the trade-off between quality and diversity, even in high-temperature settings. This approach provides a solution to mitigating the loss of accuracy caused by sampling incorrect continuations, leading to better performance in tasks that require both precision and creativity.

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g., mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$ or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in high-temperature settings.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Vector Quantization, Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance, Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance, Neural networks<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces RSAVQ, a novel Vector Quantization framework for low-bit quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs). RSAVQ addresses challenges such as unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation by incorporating Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG) and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG). EDSG uses the Fisher Information Matrix to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions, effectively reducing error expansion. WCSG dynamically allocates bits based on channel-wise sensitivity metrics for optimal quantization within bit constraints. Experimental results show that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods in LLM quantization, with improvements in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. This work not only provides a practical solution for resource-constrained environments but also establishes a theoretical link between information geometry and neural network quantization, advancing efficient deep learning.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by 0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing efficient deep learning.

<div> Keywords: Federated learning, poisoning attacks, backdoor attacks, Deep Q-Network, CIFAR-10 dataset 

Summary:
A new approach to defend against poisoning and backdoor attacks in federated learning is introduced in this research. The method involves utilizing a trust-aware Deep Q-Network to integrate multiple signals for client trust updates while optimizing for robustness and accuracy over a long time horizon. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate: (i) a baseline accuracy improvement, (ii) increased client overlap leads to better accuracy and reduced attack success rate with stable detection, and (iii) accuracy remains steady while attack success rate increases and ROC-AUC declines as observability decreases, emphasizing the importance of sequential belief updates in mitigating weaker signals. A comparison with other controllers confirms that the proposed Deep Q-Network achieves the best trade-off between robustness and accuracy. This research highlights the significance of incorporating trust-aware frameworks in defending against security threats in federated learning systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.

Summary: <br />
Budgeted Broadcast (BB) is a novel pruning method that introduces a local traffic budget concept to achieve a balance between selectivity and audience in neural networks. By maximizing coding entropy under a global traffic budget, BB improves coding entropy, decorrelation, and accuracy in various tasks such as Transformers for ASR, ResNets for face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction. The method involves simple local actuators that prune either fan-in or fan-out to maintain the balance. Results demonstrate that BB can outperform dense baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance in electron microscopy image analysis. It is easy to integrate into existing models and shows promise in learning more diverse and efficient representations. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g., magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance, $\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1 and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces RLP, a novel approach to training large reasoning models that integrates reinforcement learning earlier in the pretraining phase. By treating chain-of-thought as an exploratory action and rewarding models based on the information gain provided for predicting future tokens, RLP encourages independent thinking behavior early in training. This method reframes reinforcement learning as a pretraining objective on standard text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and effective chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP results in significant performance improvements on various math and science benchmarks, with gains compounding during post-training. The approach is demonstrated to be scalable across different architectures and model sizes, showcasing the potential for enhanced reasoning capabilities in large language models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.

<div> Reinforcement learning, structural vibrations, model-free control, Linear Quadratic Regulator, hybrid control <br />
Summary:<br />
Structural vibrations from external forces pose risks, requiring effective control strategies like Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Model-based approaches rely on accurate system models, necessitating complex system identification. A model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) method eliminates the need for explicit structural models. To enhance safety during RL training on physical systems, a hybrid control framework integrates LQR and RL controllers. Despite LQR typically needing accurate models for optimal performance, even incorrect models outperform uncontrolled scenarios. The hybrid approach generates an LQR policy from randomly selected models, ensuring model-free operation and reducing exploration risks associated with standard RL implementations. This study offers a validated solution to the safety challenges in RL-based vibration control, addressing the critical need for safe training methods. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

<div> Keywords: PU learning, non-contrastive framework, discriminative representations, noisy-pair robust supervised loss, phantom label disambiguation

Summary:
NcPU introduces a novel non-contrastive framework for Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning, addressing the challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable supervision. By combining a noisy-pair robust supervised loss (NoiSNCL) and a phantom label disambiguation (PLD) scheme, NcPU improves performance on complex datasets without the need for auxiliary information. The NoiSNCL aligns intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, while PLD provides conservative negative supervision through regret-based label updates. The framework iteratively benefits from the Expectation-Maximization framework, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving competitive performance. NcPU outperforms state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging scenarios like post-disaster building damage mapping. The approach shows promise for real-world applications and will be open-sourced for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets, especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a 14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Summary: <br />
This article proposes a novel method for detecting misbehaviour in large language models (LLMs) inspired by microsaccades, tiny eye movements that reveal hidden dynamics of human perception. By introducing lightweight position encoding perturbations, the method elicits latent signals indicating model failures without the need for fine-tuning or task-specific supervision. Experiments on various LLMs show that these perturbations can effectively surface misbehaviours related to factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoor attacks. The findings suggest that pretrained LLMs contain internal evidence to flag their own failures and that microsaccade-inspired interventions offer a promising approach for identifying and addressing undesirable model behaviors. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and mitigating undesirable behaviours.

<div> Keywords: ThinKV, KV cache compression, attention sparsity, thought types, efficient memory reuse <br />

Summary: 
ThinKV is a novel framework that addresses the challenge of overwhelming GPU memory in large reasoning models by compressing the key-value (KV) cache based on attention sparsity and thought importance. It uses a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy to assign token precision according to thought importance and progressively evict less critical tokens as reasoning trajectories evolve. A special kernel design enables efficient memory reuse of evicted tokens, reducing compaction overheads. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves nearly lossless accuracy with a significantly reduced KV cache size, resulting in improved performance with higher inference throughput compared to existing baselines. This innovation has the potential to enhance the efficiency and scalability of large reasoning models in tasks such as mathematics and coding. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV) cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve. Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots, eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

<div> ML, Vehicle delays, Domain adaptation, Gradient Boosting, Traffic intersections <br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate estimation of vehicle delays at signalized intersections is crucial for evaluating performance and informing traffic management strategies. Traditional ML models struggle with generalization due to variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver behavior across intersections. This study proposes a domain adaptation framework, Gradient Boosting with Balanced Weighting (GBBW), which separates data into source and target domains and fine-tunes the model using target domain data. By reweighting source data based on similarity to the target domain, the GBBW framework provides more accurate and robust delay estimates compared to existing models. Testing on 57 intersections in Pima County, Arizona, the framework outperformed state-of-the-art regression models and other DA methods. The framework enhances model transferability, supporting reliable traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based planning in real-world transportation systems. This approach paves the way for broader deployment of ML techniques in transportation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative; However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains, extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from 57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Summary: 
This paper explores the presence of low-rank structure in the gradients of two-layer neural networks' training loss, even when the training data and parameters are not isotropic. By studying a spiked data model with anisotropic and ill-conditioned bulk data, the researchers found that the gradient with respect to input weights exhibits low-rank properties dominated by two rank-one components: one aligned with the bulk data-residue and another with the spike in input data. The balance between these components is influenced by various factors such as training data properties, scaling regime, and activation function. Moreover, the study shows that standard regularizers like weight decay, input noise, and Jacobian penalties can selectively modulate these components. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data support the theoretical findings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

Summary: <br />
The study examines intrinsic dimension estimation (IDE) methods and proposes a benchmark called Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) that challenges existing IDE benchmarks. The QuIIEst benchmark features complex manifolds with known intrinsic dimensions and non-uniform curvature, testing the accuracy of IDE methods. Results show that IDE methods perform less accurately on QuIIEst manifolds compared to traditional benchmarks, highlighting the difficulty of the new benchmark. Additionally, IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly reveals which methods can extract the effective dimension of non-manifold spaces. This research contributes to the understanding of IDE methods and their performance on diverse datasets, providing insights into the capabilities and limitations of current techniques. <div>
arXiv:2510.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised representation learning, variational mutual information, training paradigms, predictor networks, stop-gradient operations

Summary:
This paper explores the principles behind self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) algorithms by analyzing their learning objectives and optimization strategies. The authors derive two training paradigms, Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound. SDMI requires alternating optimization with stop-gradient operations, while JMI allows for joint optimization without such components. Predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI are seen as surrogates for the MI objective. Many existing SSRL methods are shown to be specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This theoretical approach provides insights into the architectural components of SSRL methods and explains their design choices beyond empirical heuristics. <div>
arXiv:2510.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network, stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound, we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization, making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Summary:
The article introduces a metric to measure anisotropy and symmetry-breaking in datasets for machine learning applications. Symmetry-aware methods like data augmentation and equivariant architectures aim to improve model behavior on various transformations of the data. The proposed metric distinguishes between the original dataset and its randomly augmented version using a two-sample neural classifier test. It uncovers high degrees of alignment in benchmark point cloud datasets and demonstrates how distributional symmetry-breaking can impact the performance of invariant methods. The study shows that while equivariant methods still offer benefits on some datasets, their effectiveness is dataset-dependent. The findings suggest that a deeper understanding of equivariance and symmetry biases in data is crucial for optimizing the performance of symmetry-aware machine learning algorithms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets, and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent: equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Summary:
The article introduces Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a novel generative operator learning method that uses self-attention to efficiently model the mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often face computational challenges, but RheOFormer showcases strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency. It accurately learns both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of complex fluids, even with limited training data, and can predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows. By benchmarking RheOFormer across various viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of mechanics in complex domains, the study demonstrates its ability to serve as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations. This advancement in data-driven experimentation can enhance process optimization in real-time applications across a wide range of industries. <div>

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, generative modeling, training, underfitting, score function
Summary:
Diffusion models are commonly used for generative modeling, but the question of which score they actually learn during training remains unanswered. Recent research suggests that diffusion models underfit the empirical score due to inductive biases. This work introduces the concept of selective underfitting, where better diffusion models more accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space while underfitting in others. By characterizing these regions and conducting empirical interventions, the authors confirm the importance of selective underfitting for understanding diffusion models. Their findings offer new insights into the generalization and generative performance of diffusion models. Ultimately, this work sheds light on how diffusion models operate and generate novel samples by selectively underfitting the score function in specific regions of input space. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle, a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples. Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting: instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new, testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

<div> Keywords: generative models, self-correction, Masked Diffusion Models, PRISM, inference

Summary: 
PRISM introduces a method called Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions (MDMs). It aims to improve the self-correction capability of generative models by detecting and revising low-quality tokens during inference without requiring major modifications to the pretrained MDM architectures. The approach is model-agnostic and lightweight, applicable to any existing MDM. The PRISM method establishes a self-correction loss that learns per-token quality scores, enabling the detection of low-quality tokens without the need for reinforcement learning or a verifier. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRISM across various domains and scales, including Sudoku, unconditional text generation with 170M parameters, and code generation with LLaDA models containing 8B parameters. By enhancing MDM inference, PRISM shows promise in improving the quality of generated outputs in different applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for optimizing inference time in large language model (LLM) generation tasks. It presents a novel approach inspired by the Pandora's Box problem, where each generation is viewed as opening a costly box with random rewards. A UCB-style algorithm is proposed, achieving performance close to the optimal strategy even without knowledge of the reward distribution. The method is further adapted for practical LLM usage by addressing reward scaling across prompts through a Bradley-Terry transformation. Experiments on datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy can match the performance of non-adaptive sampling with 15-35% fewer generations on average. This work establishes a connection between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, offering both theoretical bounds and practical efficiency gains for deploying LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly "box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs, show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average. Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel neural network surrogate framework that can learn collective variables (CVs) directly from Cartesian coordinates and provide Jacobians using automatic differentiation. This framework addresses the bottleneck of requiring Jacobians for free energy reconstruction methods like Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), enabling the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. In a study on an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, the method demonstrated high accuracy for both simple and complex CVs. Additionally, the errors in Jacobians were found to follow a near-Gaussian distribution, making them suitable for GPR pipelines. Overall, this framework allows gradient-based free energy methods to incorporate intricate CVs, expanding the applications of biochemistry and materials simulations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover, Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of biochemistry and materials simulations.

Summary: 
Image compression and reconstruction are essential for digital applications, but traditional methods face challenges due to complex and computationally expensive decoders. A new framework is proposed that combines low-rank representation with vector quantization in an autoencoder. By implementing efficient low-rank operations on learned latent image representations, high-quality reconstructions are achieved. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead in neural compression decoding, eliminating the bottleneck while maintaining image fidelity. The framework addresses the complexity and computational costs associated with convolution-based decoders in current neural compression methods. <div>

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

Summary: 
SoftAdaClip is a novel differentially private training method that aims to improve model performance and fairness by replacing hard clipping with a smooth tanh-based transformation. This approach helps preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity, leading to reduced subgroup disparities in training. The study evaluates SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including clinical text, structured healthcare, and tabular data, demonstrating significant improvements in fairness compared to traditional DP-SGD and Adaptive-DPSGD methods. Specifically, SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD. These results highlight the need for integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and private model training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations. Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and private model training.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and $\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient, blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression, in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity, outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning, and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in large-scale models. Code is available at https://github.com/Yifei-Zuo/Flash-LLA.

<div> Diffusion models, OOD detection, SCOPED, vision, robotics <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SCOPED, a novel OOD detection method for diffusion models that is fast and efficient. SCOPED combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic, allowing for accurate OOD detection with minimal computation. By estimating the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, SCOPED can be used in an unsupervised manner with only a single forward pass and one JVP. The method outperforms existing diffusion-based OOD detection techniques and achieves competitive precision-recall scores on vision benchmarks. Furthermore, SCOPED can also be applied to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, detecting distribution shifts across different training regimes. These results demonstrate SCOPED's potential for practical and reliable OOD detection in various domains, including vision, autoregressive models, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised training. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that, in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator. On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes. These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision, outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

<div> Model-Based Policy Optimization, Synthetic Data, Reinforcement Learning, Generalization, Failure Modes
<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the effectiveness of synthetic data in Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO) for reinforcement learning. While MBPO has shown sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, it often underperforms compared to its model-free counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). The shift to DMC reveals specific failure modes of MBPO, including scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models and a poor choice of target representation. By addressing these issues, MBPO can outperform SAC in five out of seven tasks in DMC, highlighting the importance of understanding environment-specific assumptions in algorithm design. The findings suggest the need for taxonomies linking task and environment structure to algorithmic failures and emphasize the impact of benchmark choices on algorithm generalization. 

<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms generalize.

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly important, but aligning them with human preferences is key. This paper explores the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization for LLMs, offering generalization guarantees. Unlike previous studies, which assume noise-free feedback, this work considers real-world noise sources such as mislabeling and uncertainty. The analysis focuses on finite-step preference optimization, showing how generalization decays with different types of noise and noise rates. The findings apply to various preference optimization losses and are validated empirically on contemporary LLMs, providing insights for developing AI systems that better align with human preferences. <div>
arXiv:2510.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

arXiv:2510.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study, finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases. This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset and the pretrained policy.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for solving black-box optimization problems with high evaluation costs using Bayesian optimization (BO) and neural network-based surrogates. Traditional Gaussian process surrogates are limited in handling high-dimensional and irregular variables, so the proposed approach adopts a Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) Variational Bayesian Last Layer (VBLL) framework to fine-tune a neural network surrogate model. To automate hyperparameter selection, a Weighted Ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates is introduced, allowing continual updates through recursive Bayes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on high-dimensional benchmarks and real-world molecular optimization tasks. The LoRA-VBLL approach offers computational efficiency and recursive updates, showcasing its potential for various applications requiring efficient black-box optimization. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g., categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Summary: 
This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning, a robust offline reinforcement learning method that prioritizes clean expert behavior by using trajectory-level density ratios estimated from a small, verified reference set. These ratios are used as weights in the behavioral cloning objective to mitigate the impact of contaminated data without knowing the contamination mechanism. The approach is theoretically underpinned with guarantees of convergence to the clean expert policy and finite-sample bounds independent of contamination rates. Evaluation on various continuous control benchmarks demonstrates that Weighted BC outperforms traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning, and behavior regularized actor-critic methods even at high contamination ratios. <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

<div> transferability, adversarial examples, machine learning models, representation space, image classifiers

Summary:
This study discusses the transferability of attacks in machine learning models, distinguishing between attacks in input data-space and model representation space. It is shown that attacks in input data-space can transfer successfully, while attacks in model representation space require geometric alignment to transfer. Theoretical and empirical evidence is provided in four different settings to support this distinction. Mathematical proof in a simple network setting demonstrates the difference, followed by successful representation-space attacks on image classifiers and language models but with limited transferability. The study further explores data-space attacks on vision-language models, showcasing successful transfer when latent geometries are aligned post-projector space. Overall, the research highlights the critical insight that adversarial transfer is dependent on the operational domain of attacks, either in shared data-space or unique model representation space. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent large language model, aggregation algorithms, Optimal Weight, Inverse Surprising Popularity, reliability

Summary:
In this new article on arXiv, the challenge of effectively aggregating answers from multiple multi-agent large language models (LLMs) is addressed. The standard majority voting approach fails to consider heterogeneity and correlation among models. Two new aggregation algorithms, Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), are introduced to take into account first-order and second-order information. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that these methods can overcome limitations of majority voting and lead to more reliable collective decisions. Empirical validation on various datasets and benchmarks shows that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform majority voting. This research not only offers practical performance gains but also provides insights for designing robust multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning, how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally, failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions, leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established clinical protocols.

Summary:<br />
- The study focuses on zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs, aiming to generalize over new entities and relations. <br />
- Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) face limitations in distinguishing semantically distinct relations due to deterministic equivariance. <br />
- The proposed Flock model introduces probabilistic node-relation equivariance, incorporating randomization to break symmetries during inference. <br />
- Flock utilizes random walks, a recording protocol, sequence models, and learned pooling to aggregate node and relation representations. <br />
- Empirical results show Flock successfully solves diagnostic dataset Petals where traditional KGFMs fail and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity and relation prediction tasks across 54 diverse knowledge graphs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Summary:<br />
This study presents a predictive framework utilizing advanced machine learning to classify veterinary safety outcomes based on adverse event reports from the US FDA. By preprocessing and integrating data, including drug properties, the framework accurately predicts outcomes of Death vs. Recovery. Models such as Random Forest and CatBoost performed well, with ensemble methods enhancing performance. Addressing class imbalance and incorporating pseudo-labeling improved minority-class detection. Interpretability via SHAP analysis identified biologically plausible predictors, enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles. This approach strengthens residue risk assessment, informs regulatory decisions, and supports the mission of the FARAD organization focused on ensuring safe pharmaceutical use in food-producing animals.

arXiv:2510.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed, and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best, achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost. Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors, including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate, interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles, strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical decision-making.

Summary: Computational decarbonization requires accurate carbon intensity forecasts with global coverage and uncertainty estimates. CarbonX, an open-source tool, leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to achieve strong performance in carbon intensity forecasting and imputation tasks across diverse grids. Using only historical data, CarbonX achieves a zero-shot forecasting MAPE of 15.82% globally and a comparable performance with state-of-the-art on benchmark grids, providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. It can forecast up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation and outperforms statistical baselines by 1.2-3.9X on the imputation task. CarbonX is a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization, making it easy to use on any grid with limited data while delivering strong performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Summary:
- Binarized neural networks (BNNs) use binary weights and activation functions for classification, with the verification problem aiming to determine if small input changes can lead to misclassification.
- The verification problem for BNNs can be formulated as an integer programming (IP) problem, but current formulations have challenges due to large integrality gaps.
- New techniques are introduced to improve the IP formulation, including a method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class setting and generating valid inequalities based on the recursive structure of BNNs.
- These techniques enhance the ability to verify BNNs against a wider range of input perturbations compared to existing IP approaches in a shorter time. <div>
arXiv:2510.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$ constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Computational Chemistry, Round-Trip Consistency, Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning, Data-Efficient

Summary:
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL) is introduced to train Large Language Models (LLMs) in computational chemistry for improved round-trip consistency. The lack of round-trip consistency in LLMs indicates a reliance on unidirectional memorization. RTRL utilizes the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal to train models for improved consistency. An iterative variant of RTRL alternately trains forward and reverse mappings in a self-improvement loop, demonstrating high data efficiency and effectiveness with unlabelled chemistry data. Experimental results show that RTRL significantly boosts performance and consistency over strong baselines across various data regimes. This work highlights the trainable nature of round-trip consistency as an objective, offering a pathway to more robust and reliable foundation models for computational chemistry.

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models in computational chemistry often lack round-trip consistency, indicating memorization rather than mastery. Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL) introduces a framework to train models for improved consistency using round-trip success as a reward signal. An iterative variant of RTRL shows high data efficiency and effectiveness with unlabelled data, significantly boosting performance and consistency. This work underscores the trainable nature of round-trip consistency as an objective, offering a path to more reliable foundation models for computational chemistry. <div>
arXiv:2510.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.

Summary: 
This article discusses the importance of ensuring AI safety and alignment as large language models (LLMs) advance, focusing on the use of prompt guards as a defense mechanism. The authors introduce a new attack that bypasses prompt guards, demonstrating its effectiveness on various production models, including those with highly protected chat interfaces. The attack exploits a resource imbalance between the prompt guard and the main LLM by encoding a jailbreak prompt that the lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This highlights the limitations of lightweight prompt guards and emphasizes the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to preventing malicious outputs. The study also identifies additional alignment issues such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and malicious response leakage during thinking. Overall, the findings underscore the challenges in safeguarding LLMs and the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities for AI safety and alignment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update. In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards, highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok (3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and malicious response leakage during thinking.

Summary: TimeSeriesScientist (TSci) is a novel framework for time series forecasting that minimizes the need for human intervention. It consists of four specialized agents - Curator, Planner, Forecaster, and Reporter - that work together to automate the preprocessing, model selection, validation, and ensembling processes. TSci utilizes transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports to provide interpretable results. Empirical results on eight benchmarks show that TSci outperforms both statistical and deep learning models, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. The framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances transparency and interpretability in the forecasting workflow. <div>
arXiv:2510.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.

Summary:  
- Counterfactual reasoning is crucial for LLMs' causal understanding in high-stakes domains like scientific research.  
- Current assessments of LLMs' counterfactual reasoning often overlook the abduction step, leading to overestimation of their performance.  
- Executable counterfactuals framework emphasizes all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation for evaluating and improving LLMs' reasoning.  
- Results show a significant decrease in accuracy from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for state-of-the-art models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet.  
- Training on counterfactual code problems with if-else conditions and testing on out-of-domain code structures, along with reinforcement learning, improves LLMs' counterfactual reasoning and generalization to new domains, as shown through gains in performance on both code and math problems.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

<title>MIRA: Towards Mitigating Reward Hacking in Inference-Time Alignment of T2I Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative, modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g., Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO, mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone, extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

<title>Rethinking KL Regularization in RLHF: From Value Estimation to Gradient Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact, gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss. Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss' methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

<title>Large-Scale Bayesian Causal Discovery with Interventional Data</title>

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost, particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

<title>From Supervision to Exploration: What Does Protein Language Model Learn During Reinforcement Learning?</title>

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel, reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines, improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty, and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

<title>Gradient Shaping Beyond Clipping: A Functional Perspective on Update Magnitude Control</title>

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics, dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics. Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

<title>Think Right: Learning to Mitigate Under-Over Thinking via Adaptive, Attentive Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression yields gains across diverse tasks.

<title>Enhancing Noise Robustness of Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring via Contrastive Feature Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First, the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs. Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models under different noisy environments.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel, FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106 parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

<title>Posterior Collapse as a Phase Transition in Variational Autoencoders</title>

arXiv:2510.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational capacity of deep generative models.

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

<title>Demystifying Synthetic Data in LLM Pre-training: A Systematic Study of Scaling Laws, Benefits, and Pitfalls</title>

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling, yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types (rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data \textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets. Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good" ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data. Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than ~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse" during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori, reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models, enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However, in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task: detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework, which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios, demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries, enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention [Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with sketching.

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties, thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples with significant margins.

<title>The Unseen Frontier: Pushing the Limits of LLM Sparsity with Surrogate-Free ADMM</title>

arXiv:2510.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%) without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$, which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice, all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods; e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present $\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited exploration.

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

<title>Learning Time-Series Representations by Hierarchical Uniformity-Tolerance Latent Balancing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01658</link>

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations. Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

<title>Shift-Invariant Attribute Scoring for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Shapley Value</title>

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance. However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning. Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction. However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion \textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

<title>PASTA: A Unified Framework for Offline Assortment Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline approaches.

<title>Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths. These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth, fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers, deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in architecture or depth.

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151 CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised, 18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data in future epidemiological studies.

arXiv:2510.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems, enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance under different data settings.

arXiv:2510.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity (PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at https://github.com/abcbdf/basis-decomposition-official.

<title>Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>

arXiv:2510.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

<title>Private and Fair Machine Learning: Revisiting the Disparate Impact of Differentially Private SGD</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01744</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models (rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1) comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and 2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy, utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to hyperparameter choice.

This unified view allows us to systematically compare the approaches and highlight their strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into their future potential. We also provide concise descriptions of each method, complemented by practical guidelines.

arXiv:2510.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal increase in the computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL experimentation.

arXiv:2510.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data, where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics, like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search. Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase, optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers and other residual networks.

arXiv:2510.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling, particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions, such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation, which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing. This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path. Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads. This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

<title>Pre-Hoc Predictions in AutoML: Leveraging LLMs to Enhance Model Selection and Benchmarking for Tabular datasets</title>

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection, with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given dataset.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.

<title>Explicit Discovery of Nonlinear Symmetries from Dynamic Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01855</link>

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD, which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning. Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks. This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid compositional meta-learning.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework with online adversarial constraints. We present two algorithms having simple modular structures that yield universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the state-of-the-art results. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and LLaMA-7B pretraining.

arXiv:2510.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency, reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

<title>A Methodology for Transparent Logic-Based Classification Using a Multi-Task Convolutional Tsetlin Machine</title>

arXiv:2510.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to 88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

<title>Are LLMs Better GNN Helpers? Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$ and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training. To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one. It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA.

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss, loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically, we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization. Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics, biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components, anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases) within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows (MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes. Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons, rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD), indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate. However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning, creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters. Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast, robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference performance of FM.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large, carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large, unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by the weight space learning community.

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost. Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

<title>Hybrid Deep Learning Modeling Approach to Predict Natural Gas Consumption of Home Subscribers on Limited Data</title>

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil, covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption, especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across different regions.

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly. Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys, Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting, then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$, \textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However, the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts. We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst. In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient catalysts.

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation constraints.

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks, in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to significantly flatter minima.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing, provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630 participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge, representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence, particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks, which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths, Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba. Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process dense representations of images and videos.

<title>StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world Markets?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

arXiv:2510.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as training and inference contexts grow.

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G) networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator; PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over time.

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum, lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves. To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA) datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and, consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

<title>Tree-based Dialogue Reinforced Policy Optimization for Red-Teaming Attacks</title>

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings, where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success across multiple turns.

<title>Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and processing time for continual personalization.

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time, feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process, allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data, and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs, paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training dynamics.

arXiv:2510.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher, under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our approach is applicable to both classification and generative models. Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

<title>Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization</title>

arXiv:2510.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis (LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum. Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection, and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency and deployability of latent inference.

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical method to correlation clustering, a graph-based unsupervised learning task that seeks to partition the nodes in a graph based on pairwise agreement and disagreement. In particular, we adapt GCS-Q, a quantum-assisted solver originally designed for coalition structure generation, to maximize intra-cluster agreement in signed graphs through recursive divisive partitioning. The proposed method encodes each bipartitioning step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, solved via quantum annealing. This integration of quantum optimization within a hierarchical clustering framework enables handling of graphs with arbitrary correlation structures, including negative edges, without relying on metric assumptions or a predefined number of clusters. Empirical evaluations on synthetic signed graphs and real-world hyperspectral imaging data demonstrate that, when adapted for correlation clustering, GCS-Q outperforms classical algorithms in robustness and clustering quality on real-world data and in scenarios with cluster size imbalance. Our results highlight the promise of hybrid quantum-classical optimization for advancing scalable and structurally-aware clustering techniques in graph-based unsupervised learning.

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform, revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture. We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations, while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in recommendation quality.

Abstract: The stock market is extremely difficult to predict in the short term due to high market volatility, changes caused by news, and the non-linear nature of the financial time series. This research proposes a novel framework for improving minute-level prediction accuracy using semantic sentiment scores from top ten different large language models (LLMs) combined with minute interval intraday stock price data. We systematically constructed a time-aligned dataset of AAPL news articles and 1-minute Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices for the dates of April 4 to May 2, 2025. The sentiment analysis was achieved using the DeepSeek-V3, GPT variants, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and Mistral models through their APIs. Each article obtained sentiment scores from all ten LLMs, which were scaled to a [0, 1] range and combined with prices and technical indicators like RSI, ROC, and Bollinger Band Width. Two state-of-the-art such as Reformer and Mamba were trained separately on the dataset using the sentiment scores produced by each LLM as input. Hyper parameters were optimized by means of Optuna and were evaluated through a 3-day evaluation period. Reformer had mean squared error (MSE) or the evaluation metrics, and it should be noted that Mamba performed not only faster but also better than Reformer for every LLM across the 10 LLMs tested. Mamba performed best with LLaMA 3.3--70B, with the lowest error of 0.137. While Reformer could capture broader trends within the data, the model appeared to over smooth sudden changes by the LLMs. This study highlights the potential of integrating LLM-based semantic analysis paired with efficient temporal modeling to enhance real-time financial forecasting.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment, specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights: (1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2) larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that, despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++, which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Silent Tokens, Loud Effects: Padding in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.

<title>Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models, semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions, while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0), yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset, the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded, task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy, and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse, interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a 21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly, traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate (SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution (JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available, AI-native scheduling infrastructure.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as 50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the real-world.

<title>TraceDet: Hallucination Detection from the Decoding Trace of Diffusion Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents -- either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm, achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et al., 2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the realizable setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the concept class) to a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no assumptions are imposed on the data). Specifically, for any concept class $\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$, a private realizable learner for $\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only increasing the sample complexity by $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. However, when $\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011), resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$ that involves a $1/\varepsilon$ factor.
  In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon\le 1$. Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private prediction problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman (2018) and Dagan and Feldman (2020).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency, prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs - a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource optimization in endemic areas.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.

Abstract: Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void' where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage (generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative metrics against strong discrete baselines.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network topologies.

<title>Learning to Play Multi-Follower Bayesian Stackelberg Games</title>

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$ possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round, we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers' actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T \log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper bounds.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the generalization error of minimum-norm interpolating solutions in linear regression using spiked covariance data models. The paper characterizes how varying spike strengths and target-spike alignments can affect risk, especially in overparameterized settings. The study presents an exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \to \infty$), and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment. Alignment with the spike being detrimental is empirically demonstrated to persist in nonlinear models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the adoption of generative AI on financial stability. We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large language models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in trading decisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than humans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends. Increased reliance on AI-powered trading advice could therefore potentially lead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by following the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings reveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided to make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market discipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial stability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not purely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and bias.

<title>Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at https://bigml-cs-ucla.github.io/XMAS-project-page/.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e. LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching, logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$ parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of ~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM architectures.

Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana. This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable HVAC control solution.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation.

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning process in LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access. Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94% for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving model reliability and generalizability.

Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval, providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores, and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix. Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and query recommendations.

Our dataset is built on 250,000 images from ImageNet21k dataset, providing structured thinking tokens and corresponding answers. Our synthetic dataset is generated by two state-of-the-art VLMs: GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506. Each image is accompanied by two pairs of thinking-answer sequences, creating a resource for training and evaluating multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation benchmarks will be publicly available to aid research in reasoning/thinking multimodal VLMs.

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these emerging threats.

<title>Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness</title>

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

<title>Evaluating the Robustness of a Production Malware Detection System to Transferable Adversarial Attacks</title>

Abstract: As deep learning models become widely deployed as components within larger production systems, their individual shortcomings can create system-level vulnerabilities with real-world impact. This paper studies how adversarial attacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire production-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of Gmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model.
  The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection. Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve just a 20% attack success rate. We implement this defense, and, thanks to a collaboration with Google engineers, it has already been deployed in production for the Gmail classifier.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be found on the project page https://vap-r.github.io

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels, binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image, InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.

<title>Scalable Asynchronous Federated Modeling for Spatial Data</title>

Abstract: Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Secure and interoperable integration of heterogeneous medical data remains a grand challenge in digital health. Current federated learning (FL) frameworks offer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to orchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained environments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent communication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed architecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for clinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii) secure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive updates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile clients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables adaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets and pilot clinical cohorts demonstrates up to 9.8\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared with baseline FL, a 54\% reduction in client dropout rates, and clinically acceptable privacy--utility trade-offs. These results highlight MCP-enabled multi-modal fusion as a scalable and trustworthy pathway toward equitable, next-generation federated health infrastructures.

Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.

Abstract: Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low computational cost.

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms of the quality of the generated noise.

Abstract: The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

<title>Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds</title>

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$ users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if the thresholds are a priori unknown.

Abstract: This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets - a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging, balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the $Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations - converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g., program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample -- while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that approximate the LM's distribution.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.

Abstract: Quasar-convex functions form a broad nonconvex class with applications to linear dynamical systems, generalized linear models, and Riemannian optimization, among others. Current nearly optimal algorithms work only in affine spaces due to the loss of one degree of freedom when working with general convex constraints. Obtaining an accelerated algorithm that makes nearly optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$ first-order queries to a $\gamma$-quasar convex smooth function \emph{with constraints} was independently asked as an open problem in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022); Lezane, Langer, and Koolen (2024). In this work, we solve this question by designing an inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm that we implement using a first-order method achieving the aforementioned rate and, as a consequence, we improve the complexity of the accelerated geodesically Riemannian optimization solution in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022). We also analyze projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe algorithms in this constrained quasar-convex setting. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analyses of first-order methods for quasar-convex smooth functions with general convex constraints.

Abstract: We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously.
  From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.

Abstract: While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models, research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models, along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream styles.

Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal, WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression, resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.

Abstract: This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP, overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing parameters.

<title>Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers</title>

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both  measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation method.

Abstract: Improving statistical forecasts of Atlantic hurricane intensity is limited by complex nonlinear interactions and difficulty in identifying relevant predictors. Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often overlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen tropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery framework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct multiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to hurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to compare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random forest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24 to 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test cases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features primarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and surface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often underutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended predictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS predictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times of 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron further extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely regional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests confirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve forecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate that causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way toward more empirical forecasts.

<title>ReTabAD: A Benchmark for Restoring Semantic Context in Tabular Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

<title>Adaptive Kernel Selection for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality. The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels. Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD) suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in a variety of tasks.

Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at https://koichi-saito-sony.github.io/soundreactor/.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types. However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets, while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Bioinformatics tools are essential for complex computational biology tasks, yet their integration with emerging AI-agent frameworks is hindered by incompatible interfaces, heterogeneous input-output formats, and inconsistent parameter conventions. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized framework for tool-AI communication, but manually converting hundreds of existing and rapidly growing specialized bioinformatics tools into MCP-compliant servers is labor-intensive and unsustainable. Here, we present BioinfoMCP, a unified platform comprising two components: BioinfoMCP Converter, which automatically generates robust MCP servers from tool documentation using large language models, and BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which systematically validates the reliability and versatility of converted tools across diverse computational tasks. We present a platform of 38 MCP-converted bioinformatics tools, extensively validated to show that 94.7% successfully executed complex workflows across three widely used AI-agent platforms. By removing technical barriers to AI automation, BioinfoMCP enables natural-language interaction with sophisticated bioinformatics analyses without requiring extensive programming expertise, offering a scalable path to intelligent, interoperable computational biology.

Abstract: Peer review in academic research aims not only to ensure factual correctness but also to identify work of high scientific potential that can shape future research directions. This task is especially critical in fast-moving fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), yet it has become increasingly difficult given the rapid growth of submissions. In this paper, we investigate an underexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own rankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in game-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative because authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth and long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale experiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked their 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than a year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as many citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were especially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150 citations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review scores in predicting future citation counts. Our results remained robust after accounting for confounders such as preprint posting time and self-citations. Together, these findings demonstrate that authors' self-rankings provide a reliable and valuable complement to peer review for identifying and elevating high-impact research in AI.

Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses, focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g., greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196 datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding refinement.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens classical public-key cryptography, motivating NIST's adoption of post-quantum schemes such as those based on the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem. We present NoMod ML-Attack, a hybrid white-box cryptanalytic method that circumvents the challenge of modeling modular reduction by treating wrap-arounds as statistical corruption and casting secret recovery as robust linear estimation. Our approach combines optimized lattice preprocessing--including reduced-vector saving and algebraic amplification--with robust estimators trained via Tukey's Biweight loss. Experiments show NoMod achieves full recovery of binary secrets for dimension $n = 350$, recovery of sparse binomial secrets for $n = 256$, and successful recovery of sparse secrets in CRYSTALS-Kyber settings with parameters $(n, k) = (128, 3)$ and $(256, 2)$. We release our implementation in an anonymous repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NoMod-3BD4.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

Abstract: Recent autoregressive transformer-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have shown promising results by leveraging advanced semantic understanding and contextual modeling of speech. However, these approaches often rely on complex multi-stage pipelines and low sampling rate codecs, limiting them to narrow and task-specific speech enhancement. In this work, we introduce DAC-SE1, a simplified language model-based SE framework leveraging discrete high-resolution audio representations; DAC-SE1 preserves fine-grained acoustic details while maintaining semantic coherence. Our experiments show that DAC-SE1 surpasses state-of-the-art autoregressive SE methods on both objective perceptual metrics and in a MUSHRA human evaluation. We release our codebase and model checkpoints to support further research in scalable, unified, and high-quality speech enhancement.

Abstract: Arctic warming threatens over 100 billion in permafrost-dependent infrastructure across Northern territories, yet existing risk assessment frameworks lack spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and operational decision-support capabilities. We present a hybrid physics-machine learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations (2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over 10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median: -20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25% medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

<title>Quantum Fisher information matrices from R\'enyi relative entropies</title>

Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this.

<title>DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

<title>RLAD: Training LLMs to Discover Abstractions for Solving Reasoning Problems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02263</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories. Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg \pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at https://VidGuard-R1.github.io.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Abstract: We study non-stationary linear contextual bandits through the lens of sequential Bayesian inference. Whereas existing algorithms typically rely on the Weighted Regularized Least-Squares (WRLS) objective, we study Weighted Sequential Bayesian (WSB), which maintains a posterior distribution over the time-varying reward parameters. Our main contribution is a novel concentration inequality for WSB posteriors, which introduces a prior-dependent term that quantifies the influence of initial beliefs. We show that this influence decays over time and derive tractable upper bounds that make the result useful for both analysis and algorithm design. Building on WSB, we introduce three algorithms: WSB-LinUCB, WSB-RandLinUCB, and WSB-LinTS. We establish frequentist regret guarantees: WSB-LinUCB matches the best-known WRLS-based guarantees, while WSB-RandLinUCB and WSB-LinTS improve upon them, all while preserving the computational efficiency of WRLS-based algorithms.

Abstract: Fairness in predictions is of direct importance in practice due to legal, ethical, and societal reasons. This is often accomplished through counterfactual fairness, which ensures that the prediction for an individual is the same as that in a counterfactual world under a different sensitive attribute. However, achieving counterfactual fairness is challenging as counterfactuals are unobservable, and, because of that, existing baselines for counterfactual fairness do not have theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual fairness predictor for making predictions under counterfactual fairness. Here, we follow the standard counterfactual fairness setting and directly learn the counterfactual distribution of the descendants of the sensitive attribute via tailored neural networks, which we then use to enforce fair predictions through a novel counterfactual mediator regularization. Unique to our work is that we provide theoretical guarantees that our method is effective in ensuring the notion of counterfactual fairness. We further compare the performance across various datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM regarding training optimization and generalization.

Abstract: Improving the efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimized to maximally rank units by their redundancy. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet-trained VGG-16, ResNet-50 and DeiT models while simultaneously having up to 24x lower computational cost than alternative methods. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied in a one-shot manner to OPT LLM models, again outperforming competing methods.

Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Quantization is widely adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption in large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization enables efficient low-precision decoding, it suffers from substantial performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks. We propose QSpec, a novel quantization paradigm that decouples efficiency from quality by integrating two complementary schemes via speculative decoding: low-precision joint quantization for fast drafting and high-precision weight-only quantization for accurate verification. QSpec reuses both weights and KV cache across stages, enabling near-zero-cost switching without retraining or auxiliary models. Compared to high-precision baselines, QSpec achieves up to 1.64x speedup without quality degradation, and outperforms state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods by up to 1.55x in batched settings. Furthermore, QSpec supports plug-and-play deployment and generalizes well across model scales, quantization methods, and workloads. These properties make QSpec a practical and scalable solution for high-fidelity quantized LLM serving under memory-constrained scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/hku-netexplo-lab/QSpec.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for generalized In-Context Learning (ICL), termed Indirect In-Context Learning. In Indirect ICL, we explore demonstration selection strategies tailored for two distinct real-world scenarios: Mixture of Tasks and Noisy ICL. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Influence Functions (IFs) as a selection tool for these settings, highlighting the potential of IFs to better capture the informativeness of examples within the demonstration pool. For the Mixture of Tasks setting, demonstrations are drawn from 28 diverse tasks, including MMLU, BigBench, StrategyQA, and CommonsenseQA. We demonstrate that combining BertScore-Recall (BSR) with an IF surrogate model can further improve performance, leading to average absolute accuracy gains of 0.37\% and 1.45\% for 3-shot and 5-shot setups when compared to traditional ICL metrics. In the Noisy ICL setting, we examine scenarios where demonstrations might be mislabeled or have adversarial noise. Our experiments show that reweighting traditional ICL selectors (BSR and Cosine Similarity) with IF-based selectors boosts accuracy by an average of 2.90\% for Cosine Similarity and 2.94\% for BSR on noisy GLUE benchmarks. For the adversarial sub-setting, we show the utility of using IFs for task-agnostic demonstration selection for backdoor attack mitigation. Showing a 32.89\% reduction in Attack Success Rate compared to task-aware methods. In sum, we propose a robust framework for demonstration selection that generalizes beyond traditional ICL, offering valuable insights into the role of IFs for Indirect ICL.

Abstract: Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality, has become a significant global public health problem. Most existing models are static and fail to capture temporal trends in disease progression, limiting their ability to inform timely interventions. We address this gap by developing a dynamic model that leverages common longitudinal clinical indicators from real-world Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for real-time kidney failure prediction.
  Findings: A retrospective cohort of 4,587 patients from Yinzhou, China, was used for model development (2,752 patients for training, 917 patients for validation) and internal validation (918 patients), while external validation was conducted on a prospective PKUFH cohort (934 patients). The model demonstrated competitive performance across datasets, with an AUROC of 0.9311 (95%CI, 0.8873-0.9749) in the internal validation cohort and 0.8141 (95%CI, 0.7728-0.8554) in the external validation cohort, alongside progressively improving dynamic predictions, good calibration, and clinically consistent interpretability. KFDeep has been deployed on an open-access website and in primary care settings.
  Interpretation: The KFDeep model enables dynamic prediction of kidney failure without increasing clinical examination costs. It has been integrated into existing hospital systems, providing physicians with a continuously updated decision-support tool in routine care.

Abstract: Analytical solutions of differential equations offer exact insights into fundamental behaviors of physical processes. Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.

<title>Forget Forgetting: Continual Learning in a World of Abundant Memory</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.

Abstract: The full-size MLPs and the projection layers in attention introduce tremendous model sizes of large language models (LLMs), consuming extensive computational resources in pre-training. We empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: We present Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), a geometric extension of Variational Flow Matching (VFM) for generative modeling on manifolds. In Euclidean space, predicting endpoints (VFM), velocities (FM), or noise (diffusion) are largely equivalent due to affine interpolations. On curved manifolds this equivalence breaks down, and we hypothesize that endpoint prediction provides a stronger learning signal by directly minimizing geodesic distances. Building on this insight, we derive a variational flow matching objective based on Riemannian Gaussian distributions, applicable to manifolds with closed-form geodesics. We formally analyze its relationship to Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), exposing that the RFM objective lacks a curvature-dependent penalty - encoded via Jacobi fields - that is naturally present in RG-VFM. Experiments on synthetic spherical and hyperbolic benchmarks, as well as real-world tasks in material and protein generation, demonstrate that RG-VFM more effectively captures manifold structure and improves downstream performance over Euclidean and velocity-based baselines.

Abstract: Stochastic policies (also known as relaxed controls) are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we prove a $1/2$-order weak convergence rate that holds uniformly over the sampling noise with high probability, and establish a $1/2$-order pathwise convergence for each realization of the system noise in the absence of volatility control. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].

<title>Gaussian DP for Reporting Differential Privacy Guarantees in Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Current practices for reporting the level of differential privacy (DP) protection for machine learning (ML) algorithms such as DP-SGD provide an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the privacy guarantees. For instance, if only a single $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ is known about a mechanism, standard analyses show that there exist highly accurate inference attacks against training data records, when, in fact, such accurate attacks might not exist. In this position paper, we argue that using non-asymptotic Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML avoids these potential downsides. Using two recent developments in the DP literature: (i) open-source numerical accountants capable of computing the privacy profile and $f$-DP curves of DP-SGD to arbitrary accuracy, and (ii) a decision-theoretic metric over DP representations, we show how to provide non-asymptotic bounds on GDP using numerical accountants, and show that GDP can capture the entire privacy profile of DP-SGD and related algorithms with virtually no error, as quantified by the metric. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits their profiles remarkably well in all cases. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and discuss which other privacy mechanisms could benefit from GDP.

Abstract: Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.

Abstract: Score-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sampling performance by denoising a distribution perturbed by Gaussian noise. In this paper, we focus on a single deterministic denoising step, and compare the optimal denoiser for the quadratic loss, we name ''full-denoising'', to the alternative ''half-denoising'' introduced by Hyv{\"a}rinen (2024). We show that looking at the performances in term of distance between distribution tells a more nuanced story, with different assumptions on the data leading to very different conclusions. We prove that half-denoising is better than full-denoising for regular enough densities, while full-denoising is better for singular densities such as mixtures of Dirac measures or densities supported on a low-dimensional subspace. In the latter case, we prove that full-denoising can alleviate the curse of dimensionality under a linear manifold hypothesis.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as "black boxes" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance. Source code and experimental data are available at https://github.com/Star9daisy/learnable-cut-flow.

Abstract: Compression methods, including quantization, distillation, and pruning, improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, existing studies either fail to sufficiently compare all three compression methods on LRMs or lack in-depth interpretation analysis. In this paper, we investigate how the reasoning capabilities of LRMs are compromised during compression, through performance benchmarking and mechanistic interpretation. To uncover the effects of compression on reasoning performance, we benchmark quantized, distilled, and pruned DeepSeek-R1 models on four reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences, and MuSiQue). To precisely locate compression effects on model weights, we adapt difference of means and attribution patching techniques, focusing on the activation of every linear component in compressed LRMs, to interpret fine-grained causal relationships between weights and various reasoning capabilities. This fine-grained interpretation addresses a fundamental question of compression: which weights are the most important for reasoning? Overall, we find dynamically quantized 2.51-bit R1 reaches close-to-R1 performance. With empirical verification, we present three main findings that generalize across both Llama and Qwen: (1) Weight count has a greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than reasoning, highlighting the risks of pruning and distillation; (2) The MLP up projection in the final layer of distilled LRMs is one of the most important components, offering a new perspective on locating critical weights - a fundamental problem in model compression; and (3) Current quantization methods overly compress the final-layer modules and MLP gate projections, so protecting just 2% of all weights that are excessively compressed can raise average accuracy by 6.57%, greatly surpassing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Designing high-performance substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) filters with both closely spaced and widely separated resonances is challenging. Consequently, there is a growing need for robust methods that reduce reliance on time-consuming electromagnetic (EM) simulations.
  In this study, a deep learning-based framework was developed and validated for the inverse design of multi-mode SIW filters with both closely spaced and widely separated resonances. A series of SIW filters were designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. A three-stage deep learning framework was implemented, consisting of a Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), a Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network (HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), and an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net).
  The design methodology and performance of each model were systematically analyzed. Notably, IRC-Net outperformed both FIM and HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net, achieving systematic error reduction over five correction iterations. Experimental results showed a reduction in mean squared error (MSE) from 0.00191 to 0.00146 and mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.0262 to 0.0209, indicating improved accuracy and convergence.
  The proposed framework demonstrates the capability to enable robust, accurate, and generalizable inverse design of complex microwave filters with minimal simulation cost. This approach is expected to facilitate rapid prototyping of advanced filter designs and could extend to other high-frequency components in microwave and millimeter-wave technologies.

Abstract: Extreme weather is straining electricity systems, exposing the limitations of reactive responses, and prompting the need for proactive resilience planning. Most existing approaches to enhance electricity system resilience employ simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions. This paper proposes a novel tri-level optimization model that integrates proactive actions, adversarial disruptions, and reactive responses. Conformal prediction is used to construct distribution-free system-disruption uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees. The tri-level problem is solved by using duality theory to derive a bi-level reformulation and employing Bender's decomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods.

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism, and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of $\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$ denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$ simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex architectures, or adversarial data, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial perturbations induce large, localized violations of layer-wise Lipschitz continuity in a small subset of layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to empirically measure these violations and expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, our system-level analysis provides a practical method for selecting a detection threshold with a formal lower-bound guarantee on accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/Time-o1.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models is essential for building expert models tailored to specialized tasks and domains, but fully updating billions of parameters is computationally prohibitive. Reducing the number of trainable parameters using parameter-efficient fine-tuning is therefore crucial not only to reduce training costs but also to mitigate storage, caching, and serving overheads during deployment. Prior works, such as Singular Vectors-guided Fine-Tuning, have shown that exploiting the geometry of pre-trained weights can significantly improve parameter-efficiency, but they lack a solid theoretical foundation. In this paper, we introduce Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning with Column Space Projection (PiCa), a novel theoretically grounded PEFT method. We prove that projecting gradients onto the principal column space of pre-trained weights provides an effective inductive bias for adaptation and further enhance parameter efficiency through a novel weight-sharing strategy. Across diverse NLP and vision tasks, PiCa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under comparable or smaller parameter budgets, demonstrating both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The internet serves as a common source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models but is increasingly populated with AI-generated content. This duality raises the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models' generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing dependence on genAI tools, understanding such data-mediated model interactions is critical. This work provides empirical evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develops a theoretical model for this interactive training process, and experimentally validates the theory. We find that data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize their performance on shared tasks.

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it still suffers from a core trade-off: more diffusion steps ensure high performance but reduce efficiency, while fewer steps degrade performance. This remains a major bottleneck for deploying diffusion policies in real-time online RL. To mitigate this, we propose DACERv2, which leverages a Q-gradient field objective with respect to action as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step, thereby introducing intermediate supervisory signals that enhance the efficiency of single-step diffusion. Additionally, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step is inconsistent with the characteristics of the diffusion process. To address this issue, a temporal weighting mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to effectively eliminate large-scale noise during the early stages and refine its outputs in the later stages. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmarks and multimodal tasks demonstrate that, compared with classical and diffusion-based online RL algorithms, DACERv2 achieves higher performance in most complex control environments with only five diffusion steps and shows greater multimodality.

<title>Differential Information Distribution: A Bayesian Perspective on Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely used for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. However, several key questions remain unresolved: the rationale behind its log-ratio reward, how the statistical structure of preference datasets shapes its training dynamics, and how those dynamics impact downstream capabilities. We approach these questions from a Bayesian perspective, interpreting the goal of preference optimization as learning the differential information required to update a reference policy into a target policy. To formalize this view, we introduce the Differential Information Distribution (DID), defined as the distribution over samples that carry the Bayesian evidence required to update policies. We introduce three complementary insights by viewing preference optimization through the DID. First, we find that DPO's log-ratio reward is uniquely justified when preferences encode the Differential Information needed to update a reference policy into the target policy. Second, we discuss how commonly observed training dynamics in DPO, including changes in log-likelihood and policy exploration, stem from a power-law DID relationship. Finally, we analyze how training dynamics influence downstream performance using the entropy of DID, a principled measure of uncertainty in the learned information. We observe that learning high-entropy DID improves open-ended instruction-following, while low-entropy DID benefits knowledge-intensive QA. Taken together, our results show that DPO's reward design, training dynamics, and downstream capabilities all emerge as natural consequences of learning Differential Information, offering both a principled theoretical foundation and practical guidance for preference-based alignment.

<title>Learning Equivariant Models by Discovering Symmetries with Learnable Augmentations</title>

Abstract: Recently, a trend has emerged that favors shifting away from designing constrained equivariant architectures for data in geometric domains and instead (1) modifying the training protocol, e.g., with a specific loss and data augmentations (soft equivariance), or (2) ignoring equivariance and inferring it only implicitly. However, both options have limitations, e.g., soft equivariance still requires a priori knowledge about the underlying symmetries, while implicitly learning equivariance from data lacks interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose SEMoLA, an end-to-end approach that jointly (1) discovers a priori unknown symmetries in the data via learnable data augmentations, and uses them to (2) encode the respective approximate equivariance into arbitrary unconstrained models. Hence, it enables learning equivariant models that do not need prior knowledge about symmetries, offer interpretability, and maintain robustness to distribution shifts. Empirically, we demonstrate the ability of SEMoLA to robustly discover relevant symmetries while achieving high prediction performance across various datasets, encompassing multiple data modalities and underlying symmetry groups.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem, especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general, as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Abstract: We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor motifs to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To better capture the continuous structure of behavior generation, we introduce motif-based continuous dynamics (MCD) discovery, a framework that (1) uncovers interpretable motif sets as latent basis functions of behavior by leveraging representations of behavioral transition structure, and (2) models behavioral dynamics as continuously evolving mixtures of these motifs. We validate MCD on a multi-task gridworld, a labyrinth navigation task, and freely moving animal behavior. Across settings, it identifies reusable motif components, captures continuous compositional dynamics, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete segmentation models. By providing a generative account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor motifs, our approach advances the quantitative study of natural behavior.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the optimization process. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving batch-wise states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through batch-wise sample selection, with potential generalization to RLHF and broader supervised learning paradigms.

Abstract: With the rapid growth and continual updates of geospatial data from diverse sources, geospatial foundation model pre-training for urban representation learning has emerged as a key research direction for advancing data-driven urban planning. Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.

Abstract: Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains, with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to costly trial-and-error methods.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Reliable risk identification based on driver behavior data underpins real-time safety feedback, fleet risk management, and evaluation of driver-assist systems. While naturalistic driving studies have become foundational for providing real-world driver behavior data, the existing frameworks for identifying risk based on such data have two fundamental limitations: (i) they rely on predefined time windows and fixed thresholds to disentangle risky and normal driving behavior, and (ii) they assume behavior is stationary across drivers and time, ignoring heterogeneity and temporal drift. In practice, these limitations can lead to timing errors and miscalibration in alerts, weak generalization to new drivers/routes/conditions, and higher false-alarm and miss rates, undermining driver trust and reducing safety intervention effectiveness. To address this gap, we propose a unified, context-aware framework that adapts labels and models over time and across drivers via rolling windows, joint optimization, dynamic calibration, and model fusion, tailored for time-stamped kinematic data. The framework is tested using two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and harsh driving events, and three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Speed-weighted headway yielded more stable and context-sensitive classifications than harsh-event counts. XGBoost maintained consistent performance under changing thresholds, whereas DNN achieved higher recall at lower thresholds but with greater variability across trials. The ensemble aggregated signals from multiple models into a single risk decision, balancing responsiveness to risky behavior with control of false alerts. Overall, the framework shows promise for adaptive, context-aware risk detection that can enhance real-time safety feedback and support driver-focused interventions in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

We propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We place SGNNs in a unified statistical framework. Under standard loss functions, they can be interpreted as amortized Bayesian predictors trained under a simulator-induced prior. Empirical risk minimization then yields convergence to the Bayes-optimal predictor under the synthetic distribution. We employ classical results on distribution shift to characterize how performance degrades when the simulator diverges from reality. Beyond these consequences, we develop SGNN-specific results: (i) conditions under which unobserved scientific parameters are learnable via simulation, and (ii) a back-to-simulation attribution method that provides mechanistic explanations of predictions by linking them to the simulations the model deems similar, with guarantees of posterior consistency.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs) under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition, and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained} optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.

Abstract: Efficiently solving problems with large action spaces using A* search remains a significant challenge. This is because, for each iteration of A* search, the number of nodes generated and the number of heuristic function applications grow linearly with the size of the action space. This burden becomes even more apparent when A* search uses a heuristic function learned by computationally expensive function approximators, such as deep neural networks. To address this issue, we introduce Q*, a search algorithm that leverages heuristics capable of receiving a state and, in a single function call, returning cost-to-go estimates for all possible transitions from that state, along with estimates of the corresponding transition costs -- without the need to apply the transitions or generate the successor states; such action-state estimation are typically known as Q-values. This significantly reduces computation time and memory usage. In addition, we prove that Q* search is guaranteed to find a shortest path given a heuristic function that does not overestimate the sum of the transition cost and cost-to-go of the state. To obtain heuristics for Q* search, we employ a deep Q-network architecture to learn a state-action heuristic function from domain interaction, without any prior knowledge. We use Q* with our learned heuristic on different domains and action spaces, showing that Q* suffers from only a small runtime overhead as the size of the action space increases. In addition, our empirical results show Q* search is up to 129 times faster and generates up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A* search.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the industry owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the synthetic control and interventions methods to the setting with dynamic treatment effects. We consider the estimation of unit-specific treatment effects from panel data collected under a general treatment sequence. Here, each unit receives multiple treatments sequentially, according to an adaptive policy that depends on a latent, endogenously time-varying confounding state. Under a low-rank latent factor model assumption, we develop an identification strategy for any unit-specific mean outcome under any sequence of interventions. The latent factor model we propose admits linear time-varying and time-invariant dynamical systems as special cases. Our approach can be viewed as an identification strategy for structural nested mean models -- a widely used framework for dynamic treatment effects -- under a low-rank latent factor assumption on the blip effects. Unlike these models, however, it is more permissive in observational settings, thereby broadening its applicability. Our method, which we term synthetic blip effects, is a backwards induction process in which the blip effect of a treatment at each period and for a target unit is recursively expressed as a linear combination of the blip effects of a group of other units that received the designated treatment. This strategy avoids the combinatorial explosion in the number of units that would otherwise be required by a naive application of prior synthetic control and intervention methods in dynamic treatment settings. We provide estimation algorithms that are easy to implement in practice and yield estimators with desirable properties. Using unique Korean firm-level panel data, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can be used to estimate individualized dynamic treatment effects and to derive optimal treatment allocation rules in the context of financial support for exporting firms.

Abstract: Clustering problems (such as $k$-means and $k$-median) are fundamental unsupervised machine learning primitives, and streaming clustering algorithms have been extensively studied in the past. However, since data privacy becomes a central concern in many real-world applications, non-private clustering algorithms may not be as applicable in many scenarios.
  In this work, we provide the first differentially private algorithms for $k$-means and $k$-median clustering of $d$-dimensional Euclidean data points over a stream with length at most $T$ using space that is sublinear (in $T$) in the continual release setting where the algorithm is required to output a clustering at every timestep.
  We achieve (1) an $O(1)$-multiplicative approximation with $\tilde{O}(k^{1.5} \cdot poly(d,\log(T)))$ space and $poly(k,d,\log(T))$ additive error, or (2) a $(1+\gamma)$-multiplicative approximation with $\tilde{O}_\gamma(poly(k,2^{O_\gamma(d)},\log(T)))$ space for any $\gamma>0$, and the additive error is $poly(k,2^{O_\gamma(d)},\log(T))$. Our main technical contribution is a differentially private clustering framework for data streams which only requires an offline DP coreset or clustering algorithm as a blackbox.

Abstract: Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.

In addition, machine learning approaches hold the potential to boost the predictive power of computationally efficient electronic structure methods, such as density functional theory, to chemical accuracy and to correct for fundamental errors in density functional approaches. Here, recent progress in applying machine learning to improve the accuracy of density functional and related approximations is reviewed. Promises and challenges in devising machine learning models transferable between different chemistries and materials classes are discussed with the help of examples applying promising models to systems far outside their training sets.

Abstract: Coverage control is the problem of navigating a robot swarm to collaboratively monitor features or a phenomenon of interest not known a priori. The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.

Abstract: Goal recognition design (GRD) aims to make limited modifications to decision-making environments to make it easier to infer the goals of agents acting within those environments. Although various research efforts have been made in goal recognition design, existing approaches are computationally demanding and often assume that agents are (near-)optimal in their decision-making. To address these limitations, we leverage machine learning methods for goal recognition design that can both improve run-time efficiency and account for agents with general behavioral models. Following existing literature, we use worst-case distinctiveness (wcd) as a measure of the difficulty in inferring the goal of an agent in a decision-making environment. Our approach begins by training a machine learning model to predict the wcd for a given environment and the agent behavior model. We then propose a gradient-based optimization framework that accommodates various constraints to optimize decision-making environments for enhanced goal recognition. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in reducing wcd and enhances runtime efficiency. Moreover, our approach also adapts to settings in which existing approaches do not apply, such as those involving flexible budget constraints, more complex environments, and suboptimal agent behavior. Finally, we conducted human-subject experiments that demonstrate that our method creates environments that facilitate efficient goal recognition from human decision-makers.

Abstract: Building accurate models for rare skin diseases remains challenging due to the lack of sufficient labeled data and the inherently long-tailed distribution of available samples. These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.

Abstract: In recent years, privacy and security concerns in machine learning have promoted trusted federated learning to the forefront of research. Differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for privacy protection in federated learning due to its rigorous mathematical foundation and provable guarantee. Despite extensive research on algorithms that incorporate differential privacy within federated learning, there remains an evident deficiency in systematic reviews that categorize and synthesize these studies. Our work presents a systematic overview of the differentially private federated learning. Existing taxonomies have not adequately considered objects and level of privacy protection provided by various differential privacy models in federated learning. To rectify this gap, we propose a new taxonomy of differentially private federated learning based on definition and guarantee of various differential privacy models and federated scenarios. Our classification allows for a clear delineation of the protected objects across various differential privacy models and their respective neighborhood levels within federated learning environments. Furthermore, we explore the applications of differential privacy in federated learning scenarios. Our work provide valuable insights into privacy-preserving federated learning and suggest practical directions for future research.

Abstract: Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results in robust legged locomotion. While there exists a wide variety of legged platforms such as quadruped, humanoids, and hexapods, the field is still missing a single learning framework that can control all these different embodiments easily and effectively and possibly transfer, zero or few-shot, to unseen robot embodiments. We introduce URMA, the Unified Robot Morphology Architecture, to close this gap. Our framework brings the end-to-end Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning approach to the realm of legged robots, enabling the learned policy to control any type of robot morphology. The key idea of our method is to allow the network to learn an abstract locomotion controller that can be seamlessly shared between embodiments thanks to our morphology-agnostic encoders and decoders. This flexible architecture can be seen as a potential first step in building a foundation model for legged robot locomotion. Our experiments show that URMA can learn a locomotion policy on multiple embodiments that can be easily transferred to unseen robot platforms in simulation and the real world.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly more and more integrated into various applications, ensuring they generate safe responses is a pressing need. Previous studies on alignment have largely focused on general instruction-following but have often overlooked the distinct properties of safety alignment, such as the brittleness of safety mechanisms. To bridge the gap, we propose the Superficial Safety Alignment Hypothesis (SSAH), which posits that safety alignment teaches an otherwise unsafe model to choose the correct reasoning direction - fulfill or refuse users' requests - interpreted as an implicit binary classification task. Through SSAH, we hypothesize that only a few essential components can establish safety guardrails in LLMs. We successfully identify four types of attribute-critical components: Safety Critical Unit (SCU), Utility Critical Unit (UCU), Complex Unit (CU), and Redundant Unit (RU). Our findings show that freezing certain safety-critical components during fine-tuning allows the model to retain its safety attributes while adapting to new tasks. Similarly, we show that leveraging redundant units in the pre-trained model as an "alignment budget" can effectively minimize the alignment tax while achieving the alignment goal. All considered, this paper concludes that the atomic functional unit for safety in LLMs is at the neuron level and underscores that safety alignment should not be complicated.

Abstract: The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures.

Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models, but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable r x r matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for scaling factor tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of LoRA (and baselines) while using 27-90 times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant parameter efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/lora-sb.

<title>Synergizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs: A Novel Approach to Software Repository-Related Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Software repositories contain valuable information for understanding the development process. However, extracting insights from repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots support natural language interactions with repositories, chatbots struggle to understand questions beyond their trained intents and to accurately retrieve the relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We use a two-step approach: constructing a knowledge graph from repository data, and synergizing the knowledge graph with an LLM to handle natural language questions and answers. We curated 150 questions of varying complexity and evaluated the approach on five popular open-source projects. Our initial results revealed the limitations of the approach, with most errors due to the reasoning ability of the LLM. We therefore applied few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which improved accuracy to 84%. We also compared against baselines (MSRBot and GPT-4o-search-preview), and our approach performed significantly better. In a task-based user study with 20 participants, users completed more tasks correctly and in less time with our approach, and they reported that it was useful. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs and knowledge graphs are a viable solution for making repository data accessible.

<title>Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation</title>

Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, node embedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto output vectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling various vector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, link prediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitations affect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation defining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the original nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network can be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the constituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node embeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here, building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these two limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that, upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the embedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its constituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic networks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels: namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the input-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm the statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node vectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result that cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties, including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from embeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful replicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.

<title>VerifiableFL: Verifiable Claims for Federated Learning using Exclaves</title>

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their training data. This makes it challenging to provide verifiable claims about properties of the final trained FL model, e.g., related to the employed training data, the used data sanitization, or the correct training algorithm -- a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without being detected. While prior FL training systems have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to combat such attacks, existing approaches struggle to link attestation proofs from TEEs robustly and effectively with claims about the trained FL model. TEEs have also been shown to suffer from a wide range of attacks, including side-channel attacks.
  We describe VerifiableFL, a system for training FL models that provides verifiable claims about trained models with the help of runtime attestation proofs. VerifiableFL generates such proofs using the new abstraction of exclaves, which are integrity-only execution environments without any secrets, thus making them immune to data leakage attacks. Whereas previous approaches only attested whole TEEs statically, i.e., at deployment time, VerifiableFL uses exclaves to attest individual data transformations during FL training. These runtime attestation proofs then form an attested dataflow graph of the entire FL model training computation. The graph can be checked by an auditor to ensure that the trained FL model satisfies its verifiable claims, such as the use of particular data sanitization by data providers or aggregation strategy by the model provider. We implement VerifiableFL by extending NVIDIA's NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves, and show that VerifiableFL introduces less than 10% overhead compared to unprotected FL model training.

Abstract: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.

Abstract: Distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for reliable deployment of classification systems. However, OOD data is typically unavailable or difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge for accurate OOD detection. In this work, we present a method that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create high-quality synthetic OOD proxies, eliminating the dependency on any external OOD data source. We study the efficacy of our method on classical text classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification as well as classification tasks arising in LLM development and deployment, such as training a reward model for RLHF and detecting misaligned generations. Extensive experiments on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and various model sizes show that our approach dramatically lowers false positive rates (achieving a perfect zero in some cases) while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution tasks, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: Policymakers often use recursive binary split rules to partition populations based on binary outcomes and target subpopulations whose probability of the binary event exceeds a threshold. We call such problems Latent Probability Classification (LPC). Practitioners typically employ Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for LPC. We prove that in the context of LPC, classic CART and the knowledge distillation method, whose student model is a CART (referred to as KD-CART), are suboptimal. We propose Maximizing Distance Final Split (MDFS), which generates split rules that strictly dominate CART/KD-CART under the unique intersect assumption. MDFS identifies the unique best split rule, is consistent, and targets more vulnerable subpopulations than CART/KD-CART. To relax the unique intersect assumption, we additionally propose Penalized Final Split (PFS) and weighted Empirical risk Final Split (wEFS). Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methods predominantly outperform CART/KD-CART. When applied to real-world datasets, MDFS generates policies that target more vulnerable subpopulations than the CART/KD-CART.

<title>Optimal and Provable Calibration in High-Dimensional Binary Classification: Angular Calibration and Platt Scaling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.15131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of calibrating a linear binary classifier of the form $\sigma(\hat{w}^\top x)$, where the feature vector $x$ is Gaussian, $\sigma$ is a link function, and $\hat{w}$ is an estimator of the true linear weight $w^\star$. By interpolating with a noninformative $\textit{chance classifier}$, we construct a well-calibrated predictor whose interpolation weight depends on the angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ between the estimator $\hat{w}$ and the true linear weight $w_\star$. We establish that this angular calibration approach is provably well-calibrated in a high-dimensional regime where the number of samples and features both diverge, at a comparable rate. The angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ can be consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting predictor is uniquely $\textit{Bregman-optimal}$, minimizing the Bregman divergence to the true label distribution within a suitable class of calibrated predictors. Our work is the first to provide a calibration strategy that satisfies both calibration and optimality properties provably in high dimensions. Additionally, we identify conditions under which a classical Platt-scaling predictor converges to our Bregman-optimal calibrated solution. Thus, Platt-scaling also inherits these desirable properties provably in high dimensions.

<title>SCoT: Unifying Consistency Models and Rectified Flows via Straight-Consistent Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

arXiv:2502.18049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies identified an intriguing phenomenon in recursive generative model training known as model collapse, where models trained on data generated by previous models exhibit severe performance degradation. Addressing this issue and developing more effective training strategies have become central challenges in generative model research. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively trained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from the previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for integrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted training scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution estimation, generalized linear models, and nonparametric estimation. We theoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting scheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is that, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different proportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression, revealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and model performance. In some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data corresponds to the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on extensive simulated datasets and a real tabular dataset.

Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

arXiv:2503.09867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object-centric understanding is fundamental to human vision and required for complex reasoning. Traditional methods define slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised representations from models such as CLIP, DINOv2 and DINOv3, as well as slot-based approaches, for multi-object instance retrieval, where specific objects must be faithfully identified in a scene. This scenario is increasingly relevant as pre-trained representations are deployed in downstream tasks, e.g., retrieval, manipulation, and goal-conditioned policies that demand fine-grained object understanding. Our findings reveal that self-supervised vision models and slot-based representations excel at identifying edge-derived geometry (shape, size) but fail to preserve non-geometric surface-level cues (colour, material, texture), which are critical for disambiguating objects when reasoning about or selecting them in such tasks. We show that learning an auxiliary latent space over segmented patches, where VAE regularisation enforces compact, disentangled object-centric representations, recovers these missing attributes. Augmenting the self-supervised methods with such latents improves retrieval across all attributes, suggesting a promising direction for making self-supervised representations more reliable in downstream tasks that require precise object-level reasoning.

arXiv:2504.15254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.

Abstract: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

<title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>

arXiv:2505.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets. In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85% relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational efficiency with stability guarantees.

<title>LEXam: Benchmarking Legal Reasoning on 340 Law Exams</title>

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code on \href{https://github.com/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam}{GitHub} and released our data on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam}{Hugging Face}.

<title>ABBA-Adapters: Efficient and Expressive Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget, a property we validate through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/abba.

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (GPT-5) achieves $86.2\%$ and $85.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $43.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.

<title>Accelerating Targeted Hard-Label Adversarial Attacks in Low-Query Black-Box Settings</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16313</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

<title>Diagnosing and Addressing Pitfalls in KG-RAG Datasets: Toward More Reliable Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

<title>MetaFaith: Faithful Natural Language Uncertainty Expression in LLMs</title>

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

<title>DrKGC: Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion across General and Biomedical Domains</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

<title>GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This paper introduces a novel graph-based method, GARG-AML, for efficient and effective anti-money laundering (AML). It quantifies smurfing risk, a popular money laundering method, by providing each node in the network with a single interpretable score. The proposed method strikes a balance among computational efficiency, detection power and transparency. Different versions of GARG-AML are introduced for undirected and directed networks.
  Methodology: GARG-AML constructs the adjacency matrix of a node's second-order neighbourhood in a specific way. This allows us to use the density of different blocks in the adjacency matrix to express the neighbourhood's resemblance to a pure smurfing pattern. GARG-AML is extended using a decision tree and gradient-boosting classifier to increase its performance even more. The methods are tested on synthetic and on open-source data against the current state-of-the-art in AML.
  Findings: We find that GARG-AML obtains state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. We illustrate that GARG-AML scales well to massive transactions graphs encountered at financial institutions. By leveraging only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing fraud detection.
  Originality: This paper uses only basic network features and expert knowledge on smurfing to construct a performant AML system. The originality lies in the translation of smurfing detection to these features and network representation. Our proposed method is built around the real business needs of scalability and interpretability. It therefore provides a solution that can be easily implemented at financial institutions or incorporated in existing AML solutions.

<title>Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness</title>

arXiv:2506.05735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand (template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the protein binding pocket. We introduce a new benchmark of ligand pairs co-crystallized with the same target to evaluate our approach and show that it outperforms standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models. Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work, we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms: models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels. Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms, shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

<title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Urban Heat Mitigation: Attribution and Weighting of Multi-Scale Drivers</title>

arXiv:2507.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forest regression (RFR) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RFR-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce uncertainties and test the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.

<title>VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2507.12885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 simulated tasks and 3 real-robot tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both simulated and real-world settings. Results show that VFP achieves a 49% relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines in simulation, and further outperforms them on real-robot tasks, while still maintaining fast inference and a compact model size. More details are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/varfp/

Abstract: We develop Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric to interconnect accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art torus-based ML data-centers with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant compute allocations by up to 66%, reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%, and minimize the blast radius of chip failures. We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate these performance benefits which translate to 1.72X improvement in training throughput of ML models.

<title>Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.

<title>Automated Model Evaluation for Object Detection via Prediction Consistency and Reliability</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.

<title>Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization</title>

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision, especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.

arXiv:2509.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions, making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.

arXiv:2509.18216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

<title>GSM-Agent: Understanding Agentic Reasoning Using Controllable Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

arXiv:2509.24901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm, self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning. A key reason is that global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes: a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging the reliance on costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training, stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second, we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels. Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of expert actions or onboard measurements.

arXiv:2509.25035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and high-quality language generation is the holy grail that people pursue in the age of AI. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that initializes from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and distills a few-step student for fast generation. The resulting DiDi-Instruct model achieves comparable or superior performance to its dLLM teacher and the GPT-2 baseline while enabling up to 64$\times$ acceleration. The theoretical foundation of DiDi-Instruct is a novel framework based on integral KL-divergence minimization, which yields a practical training algorithm. We further introduce grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler that significantly improve training stability, model coverage, and inference quality. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct achieves perplexity from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs), which outperforms prior accelerated dLLMs and GPT-2 baseline. These gains come with a negligible entropy loss (around $1\%$) and reduce additional training wall-clock time by more than $20\times$ compared to competing dLLM distillation methods. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new methodology for quantifying the semantic coverage of test questions in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing evaluation frameworks for language model-powered applications often lack systematic methods to ensure test sets cover the underlying knowledge base comprehensively. The proposed methodology utilizes vector embeddings and clustering algorithms to assess the coverage of test questions against their corresponding documents. Metrics such as basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question coverage are calculated to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the test set. Additionally, outlier detection is employed to filter irrelevant questions and refine the test sets. Experimental results from two use cases demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in identifying content areas with inadequate representation and providing recommendations for generating new, high-value test questions. This methodology equips RAG developers with essential tools to enhance the reliability of their systems and extend their applications to tasks like identifying misaligned documents.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new, high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Summary: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are crucial for various molecular simulations. Current models enforce symmetries through equivariant neural networks, limiting flexibility and scalability. The TransIP model introduces a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials, achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Trained on the Open Molecules (OMol25) dataset, TransIP performs comparably to state-of-the-art models. It outperforms a data augmentation baseline, showing 40% to 60% performance improvement across different dataset sizes. This work demonstrates the efficacy of learned equivariance as an efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

<div> Keywords: RoPE, post-training quantization, long-context dependencies, interpolation, outlier shifting

Summary: 
RoPE-based interpolation methods have been used to extend the context window support of large language models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. However, combining RoPE position interpolation with post-training quantization can lead to accuracy degradation due to various coupled effects. The authors conducted a systematic analysis of this approach and introduced two diagnostics: interpolation pressure and tail-inflation ratios to address the issues. They proposed Q-ROAR, a weight-only interpolation-aware stabilization method for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights. Empirical results show that Q-ROAR reduces model perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14% while maintaining short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks. This approach does not require fine-tuning, architecture or kernel changes, or additional deployment overhead.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes, enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization, RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g., eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized, contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care.

Summary: 
The article presents a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which better capture the hierarchical structure of data compared to traditional Euclidean metrics. It proves that in p-adic spaces, a plane minimizing the sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 points, showcasing the alignment with hierarchical relationships. It also shows that a polynomial constructed to minimize the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points. Additionally, interpolating between points in hierarchical data is less meaningful than selecting actual observed points as representatives. Practical applications in natural language processing, such as analyzing taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology, demonstrate the significance of these results. The study suggests that p-adic metrics play a crucial role in effectively handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that utilizes pre-trained large language models to address the heterogeneity of tabular data in federated learning settings. Tabular records are converted into text and embeddings from models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa are used as universal feature extractors. This approach eliminates the need for manual schema harmonization and preserves privacy by keeping raw data local. FedLLM-Align outperforms existing methods in coronary heart disease prediction tasks, achieving improved F1-scores and reducing communication costs. It shows resilience to extreme schema divergence, unlike traditional methods that fail under such conditions. FedLLM-Align is a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge, we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments.

<div> Keywords: Foundation models, AI agents, adaptive systems, resource-efficient, agentic AI.

Summary: 
This survey discusses the intersection of foundation models (FMs) and AI agents in the context of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. It highlights the shift towards autonomous, generalizing agents powered by FMs and the challenges posed by resource limitations in deployment environments. The survey identifies techniques such as elastic inference, test-time adaptation, and dynamic multimodal integration as key to balancing accuracy, latency, and communication trade-offs. It also outlines open challenges in sustaining robustness under distribution shifts and emphasizes the importance of algorithm-system co-design and cognitive adaptation in addressing these challenges. The survey offers a unified perspective on scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI, aiming to advance discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents. <div>
arXiv:2510.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.

<div> ordinal regression, unimodal likelihood models, approximate unimodal likelihood models, ordinal data, statistical modeling
Summary: 
Ordinal regression, also known as ordinal classification, involves the classification of ordinal data where the target variable has a natural ordinal relation to the explanatory variable. Many real-world ordinal data exhibit a tendency for the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given the explanatory variable to be unimodal. While previous studies have focused on unimodal likelihood models, which guarantee a unimodal predicted CPD, these models may exhibit bias for non-unimodal CPDs. To address this issue, this study proposes approximately unimodal likelihood models that can represent both unimodal and close-to-unimodal CPDs. Experimental results show that the proposed models are effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and ordinal regression tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and OR tasks.

The authors propose scaling up the pretraining to a universal scale as a crucial step towards developing a foundational model of the material world. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure, cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization; Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures. Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates 100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction, and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational model.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based spiking neural network (SNN) models to address the computational challenges of existing transformer architectures. NeurTransformer replaces the self-attention mechanism with spike-based self-attention and fine-tunes the SNN model using surrogate learning algorithms. The methodology is benchmarked using GPT-2 models, showing a loss in cosine similarity and reduction in perplexity. Additionally, energy efficiency is highlighted, with significant reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the spike-based self-attention mechanism on digital hardware. NeurTransformer presents a scalable approach to leveraging SNNs for transformer models, offering accuracy and efficiency benefits for tasks such as general language modeling and scientific applications like material science and climate research. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of the cognitive mechanism of comparison in human learning and its relevance to machines in recovering true concepts from data. It argues that comparison is essential for ensuring correctness in concept learning for machines. The theoretical framework developed in the study focuses on the identifiability of concepts using multiple classes of observations. The research shows that with diverse observations, hidden concepts can be identified without the need for specific assumptions or generative models. Even in cases where global conditions are not met, the theory can still provide guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons. The nonparametric identification of hidden structures between classes and concepts is also explored. The theoretical findings are validated through experiments in both synthetic and real-world settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison, fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden structure between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and real-world settings.

<div> reinforcement learning, limited feedback, reward selection, policy performance, scaling<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from limited feedback (RLLF), where only a fraction of samples receive labeled rewards. The study explores two types of reward selection strategies: heuristic-based methods using reward-free information and strategies pre-trained with auxiliary evaluative feedback. It is found that selecting critical subsets of rewards that guide the agent along optimal trajectories and support recovery toward near-optimal behavior is crucial for achieving near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels. Effective reward selection methods are shown to be powerful in scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback -- only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii) strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings.

Summary:
The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating counterfactual fairness measures in AI decision-making systems by using partial identification to derive informative bounds from observational data. A Bayesian approach is introduced to bound unknown fairness measures with high confidence. The study focuses on the COMPAS dataset, analyzing fairness in recidivism risk scores concerning race, age, and sex. Results indicate a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS score when changing race to African-American and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age. The research sheds light on the complexities of evaluating algorithmic fairness and provides a method to derive meaningful bounds from available data. <div>
arXiv:2510.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race, age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

<title>Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls</title>

<div> Keywords: Language models, multi-digit multiplication, attention mechanism, long-range dependencies, inductive bias

Summary: 
Language models struggle with multi-digit multiplication due to a lack of long-range dependencies. By studying a successful model, three key findings emerged: 1) Evidence of long-range structure enables the model to encode necessary dependencies. 2) The model utilizes an attention mechanism to create a directed acyclic graph for storing and recalling partial products. 3) The model represents digits using a Fourier basis and Minkowski sums in attention heads, providing efficient representations lacking in standard fine-tuning models. Additionally, understanding the learning dynamics of fine-tuning reveals a lack of necessary dependencies. Introducing an auxiliary loss for predicting the "running sum" through linear regression aids the model in learning multi-digit multiplication successfully. This study highlights the challenge of learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and the importance of incorporating the correct inductive bias to address this issue. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via \emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve'' pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe, which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the correct inductive bias can address this issue.

<div> PrunedLoRA; structured pruning; low-rank adaptation; parameter-efficient fine-tuning; large language models

Summary:
PrunedLoRA is introduced as a framework for obtaining expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized initializations by leveraging structured pruning. Unlike traditional approaches, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, allowing for flexible and adaptive rank allocation. Through gradient-based pruning focused on minimizing pruning error for overall loss, PrunedLoRA offers fine-grained pruning and recovery updates with a solid theoretical basis. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the robustness of structured pruning, showing gradient-based pruning to be more resilient to weight perturbation compared to activation-based techniques.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding, and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods across diverse sparsity levels.

Summary:
The research introduces GRPO-$\lambda$, an extension to GRPO that improves credit assignment for large language models (LLMs) in reinforcement learning finetuning for complex reasoning tasks. The approach approximates learning from $\lambda$-return using token-level log-probabilities and a critic-free approximation of temporal-difference error. Various weighting variations for $\lambda$-return are explored, all of which show significant performance gains over GRPO. Testing on math reasoning datasets with LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters demonstrates 30-40% improved performance during RL training on different model architectures. Results show that GRPO-$\lambda$ outperforms GRPO, with an average improvement of over 3 points on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC datasets, with a notable 4.5-point improvement on the 7B model. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on $4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40% improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios; hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1. We will make our platform open to the public soon.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models, LoRAFusion, Efficient Fine-Tuning System

Summary:
LoRAFusion introduces an efficient fine-tuning system for Large Language Models (LLMs) called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that addresses inefficiencies in existing systems. It tackles runtime overhead and missed opportunities by proposing a graph-splitting method at the kernel level to fuse memory-bound operations, eliminating unnecessary memory accesses. Additionally, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning, splitting LoRA adapters into groups and solving bin-packing problems to generate balanced microbatches. The system achieves significant speedup compared to Megatron-LM and mLoRA, with improved end-to-end performance and kernel performance. The fused kernel can be seamlessly integrated into existing LoRA systems. LoRAFusion is open-source and available on GitHub for wider adoption and further development. <br /><br />Summary: LoRAFusion enhances LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs by addressing runtime overhead and missed opportunities through efficient kernel-level operations and an innovative adaptive batching algorithm, resulting in significant performance improvements compared to existing systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second, they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Summary:
Directed-MAML is introduced as a task-directed meta-RL algorithm to address challenges faced by traditional MAML in meta-RL settings. It utilizes a first-order task-directed approximation before second-order gradient computations to enhance convergence and reduce computational burden. Experimental results demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and convergence speed of Directed-MAML compared to MAML-based approaches in various scenarios. The integration of task-directed approximation in other meta-learning algorithms like FOMAML and Meta-SGD also leads to improved computational efficiency and convergence speed. <div>
arXiv:2510.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations, leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm. Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence speed.

<div> Keywords: transformers, parallel adaptive computation, latent space, pretraining, language modeling

Summary:
Thoughtbubbles introduces a new transformer variant that enables parallel adaptive computation in latent space. This approach allows tokens requiring significant computation to create "bubbles" of cloned residuals within the network for additional processing. Importantly, this behavior is learned during pretraining using only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles demonstrates superior performance compared to standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation methods on various evaluation tasks, including OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity. It also excels in zero-shot evaluations like HellaSwag and LAMBADA across different parameter scales ranging from 150M to 772M. The implicit nature of Thoughtbubbles' method enables adaptive computation to be integrated into the learning process from pretraining onwards, potentially unifying training and testing behaviors for reasoning models. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated, natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

<div> KV cache compression, throughput, efficiency, performance, multi-instruction prompting  
Summary:  
KV cache compression offers increased throughput and efficiency with minimal performance loss. However, the impact of compression on realistic scenarios like multi-instruction prompting needs more study. Certain instructions may degrade rapidly with compression, leading to their exclusion from the LLM. System prompt leakage is affected by compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias. Changes to KV cache eviction policies can mitigate these effects and enhance performance in multi-instruction tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

<div> machine learning, interpretability, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, differential equations

Summary: 
The paper introduces DIANO, a framework that uses neural networks to create physically interpretable latent spaces for dimensionality and geometric reduction of high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data. DIANO compresses input functions into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstructs them using encoding and decoding neural operators. It incorporates a fully differentiable partial differential equation solver within the latent space to enforce physical priors and enable temporal advancement of high- and low-fidelity PDEs. The framework is evaluated against baseline models such as Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders on benchmark problems like flow past a 2D cylinder and a patient-specific 3D coronary artery. The results demonstrate DIANO's effectiveness in solving PDEs in a latent space while achieving dimensional and geometrical reduction and maintaining interpretability. <div>
arXiv:2510.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent interpretability.

Summary:
This article explores the use of per-example gradient statistics in deep learning training algorithms. It demonstrates that computing additional statistics beyond the average gradient in mini-batch processing can be implemented efficiently through automatic differentiation graph surgery. The study highlights the significance of per-example gradient transformations in optimizing nonlinear operations, such as signSGD and Adam preconditioner. It reveals that the optimal placement of the sign operation and the dominance of the mean over the variance in the gradient distribution play crucial roles in successful optimization. Moreover, the article showcases that JAX's vectorization transformation is suitable for prototyping and experimenting with certain classes of models, including transformers. Overall, the research sheds light on new possibilities for algorithm design by leveraging per-example gradient information in deep learning training processes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation (AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

<div> Keywords: supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, prompt diversity, chain-of-thought supervision, generalization

Summary:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been thought to memorize training data and lack generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). However, a study on decision-making benchmarks Sokoban and General Points challenges this belief. The perceived failure of SFT is attributed to frozen-prompt artifacts, where models stick to fixed instruction templates. By introducing prompt diversity during training, SFT models show strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without sacrificing performance on known tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision aids in transferring to more challenging tasks, such as larger Sokoban grids and complex arithmetic problems, enhancing SFT's ability to generalize. Combining prompt diversity with CoT leads to robust generalization across instruction-variant and difficulty-variant scenarios, matching or surpassing RL baselines while retaining the simplicity and stability of SFT.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

Summary: <br />Microscopy techniques generate large amounts of complex image data that can be simplified using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to reveal underlying physical structures. The performance of VAEs relies on specific design choices, which are typically optimized through trial and error. This study focuses on reward-based strategies for evaluating latent space representations in VAE workflows using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data as a model system. By approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM), efficient reward functions can be constructed to guide the search for optimal representations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of GMM and BGMM in estimating model efficiency and facilitating automated optimization of VAE workflows. <div>

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

- Recurrent networks excel at state tracking but struggle with recall, while Transformers are strong at recall but weaker in state tracking on longer sequences.
- Hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components were constructed to leverage the strengths of both architectures.

- A training strategy of delaying the training of attention layers was proposed, which significantly improved length generalization performance, allowing the hybrid models to achieve high accuracy (>90%) on sequences three times longer than those used in training.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy ($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during training.

Summary: 
This paper introduces an Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to address the "prior hole" problem in Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By modeling the prior as an energy-based model (EBM) and utilizing a variational approach to tackle the normalization constant, the method can generate high-quality images with reduced prior holes and improved sampling efficiency. The proposed EVaLP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in image generation tasks. This approach offers flexibility to match posteriors while maintaining fast sample generation. By formulating training priors as an alternating optimization problem and utilizing a sampler network, the EVaLP method provides an efficient and effective solution to the blurry and inconsistent sample generation issues commonly associated with VAEs. <div>

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation, high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches. The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency.

Summary:
SLogic is a novel framework for knowledge graph completion that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules, addressing the limitation of fixed confidence scores in existing approaches. It utilizes a scoring function that considers the subgraph centered on a query's head entity to assess the significance of each rule dynamically. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including embedding-based and rule-based methods, by leveraging local subgraph context. This approach offers an interpretable way to capture compositional relationships in knowledge graphs while adapting rule importance based on query-specific context. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, SLogic demonstrates consistent performance improvement, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing knowledge graph completion tasks. <div>

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity, allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Large Language Models, bidirectional attention mechanism, KV Cache, parallel decoding algorithms, Free Draft-and-Verification

Summary: 
Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) utilize bidirectional attention to capture context connections, overcoming challenges like the "reversal curse." However, DLLMs face inference efficiency issues due to their bidirectional nature's incompatibility with KV Cache. Existing parallel decoding algorithms sacrifice performance for speed. To address this, the novel Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave) algorithm ensures lossless parallel decoding for DLLMs. By combining parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, Freedave achieves a 2.8x throughput increase without performance degradation in math reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However, this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: hallucinations, Large Language Model, activation tensors, ACT-ViT, multi-LLM training

Summary: 
ACT-ViT is introduced as a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages the sequential structure of activation data in LLMs and treats activation tensors like images. The model, inspired by Vision Transformers, outperforms traditional probing techniques by efficiently analyzing activation tensors from multiple LLMs. By training on data from various LLMs, ACT-ViT achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets and can be effectively fine-tuned for new LLMs. The architecture is demonstrated to be highly efficient for deployment and is available for use with code provided on GitHub. This innovative approach enhances the safety of deploying LLM-generated text by improving the detection of hallucinations in a diverse range of LLM models and datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Summary: This study investigates the loss of plasticity (LoP) phenomenon in deep learning models operating in non-stationary environments. LoP refers to a decrease in the models' ability to learn over time. The research identifies two main causes of LoP: frozen units due to activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy. Interestingly, features that enhance generalization in static settings can contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios. The study validates its findings through numerical simulations and suggests potential strategies for mitigation, such as architectural adjustments or targeted perturbations. The results of this work provide a foundational understanding of LoP in gradient-based learning systems, shedding light on the challenges posed by non-stationary data environments. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios. We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation strategies.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Lipschitz bandit problem with stochastic delayed feedback, where rewards are observed after a random delay. For bounded delays, a delay-aware zooming algorithm is proposed, maintaining optimal performance with a term scaling with the maximal delay. In the case of unbounded delays, a phased learning strategy accumulates feedback over scheduled intervals, almost optimally up to logarithmic factors based on a regret lower bound. Experimental results showcase the efficiency of the algorithms across different delay scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay $\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals, and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated inference methods such as one-shot federated learning and edge ensembles have shown promise in combining predictions from multiple models. However, the robustness of these methods has been largely overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. This study addresses the issue by formalizing the problem of robust federated inference and conducting a comprehensive analysis. The research reveals that the accuracy of averaging-based aggregators is influenced by the dissimilarity between honest responses and the margin between the most probable classes. Moreover, non-linear aggregators pose a challenge in ensuring robustness, leading to the formulation of an adversarial machine learning problem. A novel approach involving the DeepSet aggregation model is introduced to enhance the robustness of non-linear aggregators through a combination of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation. This approach outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements across various benchmark datasets. <div>
arXiv:2510.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging, we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

<div> Large Language Models, Automatic Modulation Classification, DiSC-AMC, token-efficient, parameter-efficient <br />
<br />
Summary: DiSC-AMC is a token- and parameter-efficient variant of Large Language Models for Automatic Modulation Classification. It discretizes higher-order statistics into compact tokens, prunes exemplar lists using a neural prefilter, filters low-impact features, and enforces label-only predictions through a prompt template. These changes reduce input/output tokens and model parameters by over half while maintaining competitive accuracy. In tests with ten modulation types under noise, a baseline model achieves 5.2% accuracy, while DiSC-AMC using a smaller model achieves 45.5% accuracy. This demonstrates that careful discretization and context selection can significantly reduce inference cost while enabling practical in-the-loop deployment of prompt-based AMC. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token- and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen} baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately 5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains 45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, DecepChain, backdoor attack, reasoning, human trust

Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities, relying on chain-of-thoughts (CoT) similar to humans. However, a new risk called DecepChain has emerged, where attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent reasoning that appears legitimate. This backdoor attack leverages LLMs' own hallucinations and fine-tunes them on naturally erroneous rollouts to produce misleading conclusions. By using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with flipped rewards and a plausibility regularizer, DecepChain achieves high success rates with minimal impact on benign scenarios. Human evaluation struggles to differentiate manipulated reasoning from authentic ones, highlighting the stealthiness of this attack. If left unresolved, DecepChain could undermine human trust in LLM reasoning, necessitating urgent research to address this alarming risk. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

Summary: 
This research explores the training of transformers without skip connections, a challenging task due to their destabilizing effect on optimization. By analyzing the Jacobian of skipless transformer blocks, the study reveals the importance of skip connections for stabilization and the disruption they cause to hierarchical representations. Through a novel initialization strategy, the researchers introduce a method to efficiently train skipless transformers, specifically Vision Transformers (ViTs). The results show that skipless ViTs trained with this approach can overcome optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform baseline models with skip connections on dense prediction tasks. This suggests that skip connections are not essential for training ViTs and offers new possibilities for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

arXiv:2510.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

The article introduces a new approach, in-context curiosity, to enhance the generalization ability of Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs) in decision-making tasks. The proposed Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) framework integrates an auxiliary reward predictor to leverage prediction errors as intrinsic curiosity signals during training. Experiments on Gaussian multi-armed bandits demonstrate that PPT improves robustness and mitigates performance degradation in scenarios with higher variance in rewards, particularly when the pretraining data lacks diversity.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity. While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

Summary:<br />
Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are more challenging to solve than standard MDPs as there is no universally optimal policy applicable to all initial state distributions. This study examines how the optimal value of CMDPs changes with different initial distributions, establishing bounds on these variations through duality analysis and perturbation analysis in linear programming. The bounds provide insight into how a policy may incur regret from unknown fluctuations in the initial distribution, enhancing understanding of policy performance under varying conditions. The research highlights the complexity of CMDPs and offers analytical tools for evaluating policy robustness in the face of changing initial distributions. <div>

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the initial distribution.

Summary:
Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer designed for the tokenization and generation of protein structures. It simplifies protein structure tokenizers by using a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. This approach eliminates the need for frame-based representations, complex losses, and SE(3)-invariant operations, making the training process more stable. Models trained with Kanzi outperform existing tokenizers in reconstruction metrics while using fewer parameters and training resources. An autoregressive model utilizing Kanzi performs better than similar token-based generative models but falls short of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models. The availability of code on GitHub allows for further exploration and application of Kanzi in protein structure analysis. The development of Kanzi represents a significant step towards efficient and effective tokenization in protein structure modeling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures. Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention. We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

Summary:
The article introduces AReUReDi, a discrete optimization algorithm that guarantees convergence to the Pareto front when designing sequences with multiple competing objectives in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling towards Pareto-optimal states while maintaining distributional invariance. By applying AReUReDi to peptide and SMILES sequence design with up to five therapeutic properties, including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling, the algorithm outperforms evolutionary and diffusion-based approaches. These results establish AReUReDi as an effective framework for generating multi-property biomolecules through sequence optimization. <div>

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

<div> Keywords: continual learning, query-only attention, transformer architectures, catastrophic forgetting, meta-learning

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a query-only attention mechanism for continual learning, which helps mitigate loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting in scenarios with distributional shift across tasks. The mechanism simplifies transformer architectures by discarding keys and values while preserving core inductive biases. The study establishes a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and model agnostic meta-learning, viewing them as instances of meta-learning. Intuition is provided on how query-based models and attention networks can retain plasticity in continual learning settings. Preliminary analysis of the Hessian spectrum reveals that models maintaining a higher curvature rank across tasks tend to maintain plasticity. The findings suggest that full attention may not be necessary to capture the benefits of meta-learning in continual learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in continual learning.

<div> Keywords: Large Language models, symbolic control policies, program synthesis, numerical optimization, control tasks

Summary: 
Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating symbolic control policies that resemble program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models lack the ability to differentiate the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it uses, leading to inefficiencies in the search process. To address this limitation, a hybrid approach is proposed that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by incorporating an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. This method involves extracting and optimizing the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs to enhance task performance. Through the integration of symbolic program synthesis and numerical optimization, the approach achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. By combining interpretability with high performance, it bridges the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language, called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations. Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional, staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task. Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K) rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population, we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3. Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for accurate fitting of the full model.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel approach, Composer, for designing hybrid model architectures by combining computational primitives like Attention and MLP. The study identifies that the order of primitives can impact model performance. Composer automates the exploration of hybrid model architectures, efficiently searching for optimal configurations. By extrapolating top-performing architectures to larger scales, Composer discovers new hybrid LLM architectures that outperform existing models, achieving lower validation loss and improved accuracy on downstream tasks. These new models demonstrate enhanced training and inference efficiency at parameter scales ranging from 350M to 3B. This systematic framework offers a principled method for discovering and optimizing hybrid model architectures, showcasing the potential for improved performance in natural language processing tasks.  <br /> <div>

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g., Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework -- Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving both training and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to a variety of density estimation benchmarks.

The multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) is introduced to learn continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By using a Gaussian process prior on the Hamiltonian surface and incorporating variable-step multistep integrator constraints as linear functionals, MS-PHS GP allows for closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without the need for latent states. This approach enforces energy balance and passivity and offers a finite-sample vector-field bound to separate estimation and discretization terms.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

<title>Train on Validation (ToV): Fast data selection with applications to fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process: $(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases, our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials. These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference with DALEs optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more efficient cognitive assessments.

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval, where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED) are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region (G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e., graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference. Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph similarity.

<title>Can Mamba Learn In Context with Outliers? A Theoretical Generalization Analysis</title>

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments.

<title>Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity, preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g., male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the $\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations. Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to outperform SAEs.

<title>Learning a Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable. Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations, thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/ZO_Fine_tuner.git.

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at https://github.com/vuno/contextualized-srrg.

<title>Plug-and-Play Prompt Refinement via Latent Feedback for Diffusion Model Alignment</title>

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory, thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement. Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

<title>On-the-Fly Data Augmentation via Gradient-Guided and Sample-Aware Influence Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00434</link>

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window. Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning. Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the method's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations, enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems, where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies. Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

<title>TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}. Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

arXiv:2510.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic, the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small models.

<title>Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning. Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD), and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting rather than a helpful shortcut.

<title>Vicinity-Guided Discriminative Latent Diffusion for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor, and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al. (2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations, using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1, suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step, we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore, depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

<title>Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors. This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR), Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking in global health contexts.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization strategy.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021] established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$ against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online learnable in the agnostic setting.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the forecast quality.

<title>Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set, demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport. We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated, our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly, we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

<title>FAME: Adaptive Functional Attention with Expert Routing for Function-on-Function Regression</title>

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging. Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles (LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$ communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

<title>Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Classify Documents on Digital Development</title>

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically, TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench, especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm, where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

<title>Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.

<title>In-Place Feedback: A New Paradigm for Guiding LLMs in Multi-Turn Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2510.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition, artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds. To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $ \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$. Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at https://github.com/ZRNB/MG2FlowNet.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution, we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve image-prompt alignment.

<title>Stabilizing Policy Gradients for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention (rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.

<title>Mechanistic Interpretability as Statistical Estimation: A Variance Analysis of EAP-IG</title>

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings. In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method: EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself. Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis capabilities.

<title>The data-quality illusion: Rethinking Classifier-based quality filtering for LLM Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to enhance their performance.

<title>A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction</title>

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i) *structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data, enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene expression data analysis

<title>RiskPO: Risk-based Policy Optimization via Verifiable Reward for LLM Post-Training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however, prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically, RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success, we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time by over 70%.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM), which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori, spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$, with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score $|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

We empirically show that our equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

<title>Meaningless Tokens, Meaningful Gains: How Activation Shifts Enhance LLM Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

<title>Gated X-TFC: Soft Domain Decomposition for Forward and Inverse Problems in Sharp-Gradient PDEs</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function (RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D) convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast, uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female, while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting, white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics, and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision 0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features, including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing generalization.

<title>Augmenting LLMs for General Time Series Understanding and Prediction</title>

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.

<title>Privacy Preserved Federated Learning with Attention-Based Aggregation for Biometric Recognition</title>

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training, provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the central server that weights local model updates according to their significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models (LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards. Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary. COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification accuracy.

<title>Rethinking Thinking Tokens: LLMs as Improvement Operators</title>

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length, token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier, e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency. Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts. Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL.

arXiv:2510.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution, we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs, we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN, ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising privacy guarantees.

arXiv:2510.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method, establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with provable optimality.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance.

<title>How Does the Pretraining Distribution Shape In-Context Learning? Task Selection, Generalization, and Robustness</title>

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory. Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with: verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other, resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM) training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment} by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead $\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and (iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and enabling flexible inference time user control.

<title>Fiaingen: A financial time series generative method matching real-world data quality</title>

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.

<title>On the Benefits of Weight Normalization for Overparameterized Matrix Sensing</title>

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

arXiv:2510.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration. We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

arXiv:2510.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.

<title>BroRL: Scaling Reinforcement Learning via Broadened Exploration</title>

arXiv:2510.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance. Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

<title>Temporal Score Rescaling for Temperature Sampling in Diffusion and Flow Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a `local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks -- image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter distribution.

<title>Dirichlet-Prior Shaping: Guiding Expert Specialization in Upcycled MoEs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence, weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models (with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

<title>PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models</title>

arXiv:2509.25774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Abstract: Research on audio generation has progressively shifted from waveform-based approaches to spectrogram-based methods, which more naturally capture harmonic and temporal structures. At the same time, advances in image synthesis have shown that autoregression across scales, rather than tokens, improves coherence and detail. Building on these ideas, we introduce MARS (Multi-channel AutoRegression on Spectrograms), a framework that treats spectrograms as multi-channel images and employs channel multiplexing (CMX), a reshaping technique that lowers height and width without discarding information. A shared tokenizer provides consistent discrete representations across scales, enabling a transformer-based autoregressor to refine spectrograms from coarse to fine resolutions efficiently. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that MARS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, establishing an efficient and scalable paradigm for high-fidelity audio generation.

Abstract: Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and 91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a serious sleep-related breathing disorder that is common and can impact health if left untreated. Currently the traditional method for screening and diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography is expensive and takes a lot of time, and is not practical for screening large groups of people. In this paper, we explored a more accessible option, using respiratory audio recordings to spot signs of apnea.We utilized 18 audio files.The approach involved converting breathing sounds into spectrograms, balancing the dataset by oversampling apnea segments, and applying class weights to reduce bias toward the majority class. The model reached a recall of 90.55 for apnea detection. Intentionally, prioritizing catching apnea events over general accuracy. Despite low precision,the high recall suggests potential as a low-cost screening tool that could be used at home or in basic clinical setups, potentially helping identify at-risk individuals much earlier.

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a ``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities, and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/miniHui/Geo-R1.

arXiv:2510.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to efficiently identify multiple candidates in high trial-and-error cost tasks such as drug discovery, we propose a near-optimal algorithm to identify all {\epsilon}-best arms (i.e., those at most {\epsilon} worse than the optimum). Specifically, we introduce LinFACT, an algorithm designed to optimize the identification of all {\epsilon}-best arms in linear bandits. We establish a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of this problem and demonstrate that LinFACT achieves instance optimality by matching this lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. A key ingredient of our proof is to integrate the lower bound directly into the scaling process for upper bound derivation, determining the termination round and thus the sample complexity. We also extend our analysis to settings with model misspecification and generalized linear models. Numerical experiments, including synthetic and real drug discovery data, demonstrate that LinFACT identifies more promising candidates with reduced sample complexity, offering significant computational efficiency and accelerating early-stage exploratory experiments.

<title>Private Learning of Littlestone Classes, Revisited</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00076</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider online and PAC learning of Littlestone classes subject to the constraint of approximate differential privacy. Our main result is a private learner to online-learn a Littlestone class with a mistake bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{9.5}\cdot \log(T))$ in the realizable case, where $d$ denotes the Littlestone dimension and $T$ the time horizon. This is a doubly-exponential improvement over the state-of-the-art [GL'21] and comes polynomially close to the lower bound for this task.
  The advancement is made possible by a couple of ingredients. The first is a clean and refined interpretation of the ``irreducibility'' technique from the state-of-the-art private PAC-learner for Littlestone classes [GGKM'21]. Our new perspective also allows us to improve the PAC-learner of [GGKM'21] and give a sample complexity upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{d^5 \log(1/\delta\beta)}{\varepsilon \alpha})$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote the accuracy and confidence of the PAC learner, respectively. This improves over [GGKM'21] by factors of $\frac{d}{\alpha}$ and attains an optimal dependence on $\alpha$.
  Our algorithm uses a private sparse selection algorithm to \emph{sample} from a pool of strongly input-dependent candidates. However, unlike most previous uses of sparse selection algorithms, where one only cares about the utility of output, our algorithm requires understanding and manipulating the actual distribution from which an output is drawn. In the proof, we use a sparse version of the Exponential Mechanism from [GKM'21] which behaves nicely under our framework and is amenable to a very easy utility proof.

<title>Directed Information $\gamma$-covering: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Context Engineering</title>

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Directed Information $\gamma$-covering}, a simple but general framework for redundancy-aware context engineering. Directed information (DI), a causal analogue of mutual information, measures asymmetric predictiveness between chunks. If $\operatorname{DI}_{i \to j} \ge H(C_j) - \gamma$, then $C_i$ suffices to represent $C_j$ up to $\gamma$ bits. Building on this criterion, we formulate context selection as a $\gamma$-cover problem and propose a greedy algorithm with provable guarantees: it preserves query information within bounded slack, inherits $(1+\ln n)$ and $(1-1/e)$ approximations from submodular set cover, and enforces a diversity margin. Importantly, building the $\gamma$-cover is \emph{query-agnostic}: it incurs no online cost and can be computed once offline and amortized across all queries. Experiments on HotpotQA show that $\gamma$-covering consistently improves over BM25, a competitive baseline, and provides clear advantages in hard-decision regimes such as context compression and single-slot prompt selection. These results establish DI $\gamma$-covering as a principled, self-organizing backbone for modern LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.

Abstract: We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large, execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability. We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective, and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches 93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match). In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.

<title>TGPO: Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks</title>

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization, to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion. Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline. The code will be available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TGPO

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs) use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: With the European Union introducing gender quotas on corporate boards, this study investigates the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on firms' carbon emission performance (CEP). Using panel regressions and advanced machine learning algorithms on data from European firms between 2016 and 2022, the analyses reveal a significant non-linear relationship. Specifically, CEP improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 percent, beyond which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in CEP. A minimum threshold of 22 percent BGD is necessary for meaningful improvements in CEP. To assess the legitimacy of CEP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG controversies affect the relationship between BGD and CEP. The results show no significant effect, suggesting that the effect of BGD is driven by governance mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, structural equation modelling (SEM) indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to CEP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes CEP. The results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.

Abstract: The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge aims to advance neural audio coding for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The first edition focuses on low-resource neural speech codecs that must operate reliably under everyday noise and reverberation, while satisfying strict constraints on computational complexity, latency, and bitrate. Track 1 targets transparency codecs, which aim to preserve the perceptual transparency of input speech under mild noise and reverberation. Track 2 addresses enhancement codecs, which combine coding and compression with denoising and dereverberation. This paper presents the official baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC Challenge. The baselines are convolutional neural codec models with Residual Vector Quantization, trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and reconstruction objectives. We detail the data filtering and augmentation strategies, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint selection criteria.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers, reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations. High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs. Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as 1-2 hours.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a non-local five-moment electron pressure tensor closure parametrized by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions, susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.

Abstract: We study counterfactual stochastic optimization of conditional loss functionals under misspecified and noisy gradient information. The difficulty is that when the conditioning event has vanishing or zero probability, naive Monte Carlo estimators are prohibitively inefficient; kernel smoothing, though common, suffers from slow convergence. We propose a two-stage kernel-free methodology. First, we show using Malliavin calculus that the conditional loss functional of a diffusion process admits an exact representation as a Skorohod integral, yielding variance comparable to classical Monte-Carlo variance. Second, we establish that a weak derivative estimate of the conditional loss functional with respect to model parameters can be evaluated with constant variance, in contrast to the widely used score function method whose variance grows linearly in the sample path length. Together, these results yield an efficient framework for counterfactual conditional stochastic gradient algorithms in rare-event regimes.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Abstract: Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds showing the near-optimality of our scheme.

<title>Which Programming Language and Model Work Best With LLM-as-a-Judge For Code Retrieval?</title>

Abstract: Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github repo}.

<title>Structural Refinement of Bayesian Networks for Efficient Model Parameterisation</title>

Abstract: Many Bayesian network modelling applications suffer from the issue of data scarcity. Hence the use of expert judgement often becomes necessary to determine the parameters of the conditional probability tables (CPTs) throughout the network. There are usually a prohibitively large number of these parameters to determine, even when complementing any available data with expert judgements. To address this challenge, a number of CPT approximation methods have been developed that reduce the quantity and complexity of parameters needing to be determined to fully parameterise a Bayesian network. This paper provides a review of a variety of structural refinement methods that can be used in practice to efficiently approximate a CPT within a Bayesian network. We not only introduce and discuss the intrinsic properties and requirements of each method, but we evaluate each method through a worked example on a Bayesian network model of cardiovascular risk assessment. We conclude with practical guidance to help Bayesian network practitioners choose an alternative approach when direct parameterisation of a CPT is infeasible.

<title>Navigating the Synchrony-Stability Frontier in Adaptive Chatbots</title>

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora (DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility," showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system maintainability.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential, autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Abstract: Neural network approaches that parameterize value functions have succeeded in approximating high-dimensional optimal feedback controllers when the Hamiltonian admits explicit formulas. However, many practical problems, such as the space shuttle reentry problem and bicycle dynamics, among others, may involve implicit Hamiltonians that do not admit explicit formulas, limiting the applicability of existing methods. Rather than directly parameterizing controls, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we propose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly parameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws. Our method enforces physical principles by ensuring trained networks adhere to the control laws by exploiting the fundamental relationship between the optimal control and the value function's gradient; this is a direct consequence of the connection between Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and dynamic programming. Using Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), we achieve efficient training despite temporal coupling in trajectory optimization. We show that JFB produces descent directions for the optimal control objective and experimentally demonstrate that our approach effectively learns high-dimensional feedback controllers across multiple scenarios involving implicit Hamiltonians, which existing methods cannot address.

Abstract: Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i) straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive simulations and a real-data application.

Abstract: Earthquake ground motions and the related damage can be significantly impacted by near-surface soils. Accurate predictions of seismic hazard require depth-continuous models of soil stiffness, commonly described in terms of shear-wave velocity (VS). For regional-scale studies, efforts to predict VS remotely, such as the U.S. Geological Survey's National Crustal Model, tend to emphasize deeper lithologic velocity structures, thus simplifying important near-surface soil velocity variations, and tend to be produced at relatively coarse geospatial resolution for one geographic area. In this study, we define a functional form to describe VS-with-depth across the conterminous U.S. We calibrate the parameters of the function using a national compilation of more than 9,000 in-situ geotechnical measurements. By coupling the parametric framework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to provide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface geotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model and supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and coseismic hazard assessments.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide. While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases.

Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be useful in various applications such as travel time prediction, prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting. Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE (Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from 10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon. Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute horizons compared to analytical models.

Abstract: An algorithm is proposed, analyzed, and tested for solving continuous nonlinear-equality-constrained optimization problems where the constraints are defined by an expectation or an average over a large (finite) number of terms. The main idea of the algorithm is to solve a sequence of equality-constrained problems, each involving a finite sample of constraint-function terms, over which the sample set grows progressively. Under assumptions about the constraint functions and their first- and second-order derivatives that are reasonable in some real-world settings of interest, it is shown that -- with a sufficiently large initial sample -- solving a sequence of problems defined through progressive sampling yields a better worst-case sample complexity bound compared to solving a single problem with a full set of samples. The results of numerical experiments with a set of test problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can be effective in practice.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions. The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread prominence, yet their vulnerability to prompt injection and other adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that proactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To achieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that ensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events related to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection attacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%. Notably, the ontology-based framework not only mitigates adversarial threats but also enhances the overall performance and reliability of the system. Furthermore, PromptShield's modular and adaptable design ensures its applicability beyond cloud security, making it a robust solution for safeguarding generative AI applications across various domains. By laying the groundwork for AI safety standards and informing future policy development, this work stimulates a crucial dialogue on the pivotal role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF), an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic logs while improving efficiency and accuracy. CIAF standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistency in log interpretation. This not only enhances data quality but also provides investigators with reliable, standardized information for decision-making. To evaluate security and performance, we analyzed Microsoft Azure logs containing ransomware-related events. By simulating attacks and assessing CIAF's impact, results showed significant improvement in ransomware detection, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of 93 percent. CIAF's modular, adaptable design extends beyond ransomware, making it a robust solution for diverse cyberattacks. By laying the foundation for standardized forensic methodologies and informing future AI-driven automation, this work underscores the role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in enhancing cloud forensic investigations. These advancements improve cloud security while paving the way for efficient, automated forensic workflows.

Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection. In particular, we focus on AdaDetect, a powerful learning-based framework for novelty detection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. While AdaDetect provides rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, its behavior under adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. We first formulate an oracle attack setting that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR, deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks. This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack scheme that only requires query access to AdaDetect's output labels. Coupling these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust alternatives.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust, transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study, concept-augmented explanations disambiguate token roles. In a user study on the programming-language classification task, concept-augmented explanations disambiguated token roles and improved human-centric explainability by 37 percentage points compared with token-level attributions using Integrated Gradients.

Abstract: When training large-scale models, the performance typically scales with the number of parameters and the dataset size according to a slow power law. A fundamental theoretical and practical question is whether comparable performance can be achieved with significantly smaller models and substantially less data. In this work, we provide a positive and constructive answer. We prove that a generic permutation-invariant function of $d$ objects can be asymptotically compressed into a function of $\operatorname{polylog} d$ objects with vanishing error. This theorem yields two key implications: (Ia) a large neural network can be compressed to polylogarithmic width while preserving its learning dynamics; (Ib) a large dataset can be compressed to polylogarithmic size while leaving the loss landscape of the corresponding model unchanged. (Ia) directly establishes a proof of the \textit{dynamical} lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that any ordinary network can be strongly compressed such that the learning dynamics and result remain unchanged. (Ib) shows that a neural scaling law of the form $L\sim d^{-\alpha}$ can be boosted to an arbitrarily fast power law decay, and ultimately to $\exp(-\alpha' \sqrt[m]{d})$.

Abstract: The transcriptional response to genetic perturbation reveals fundamental insights into complex cellular systems. While current approaches have made progress in predicting genetic perturbation responses, they provide limited biological understanding and cannot systematically refine existing knowledge. Overcoming these limitations requires an end-to-end integration of data-driven learning and existing knowledge. However, this integration is challenging due to inconsistencies between data and knowledge bases, such as noise, misannotation, and incompleteness. To address this challenge, we propose ALIGNED (Adaptive aLignment for Inconsistent Genetic kNowledgE and Data), a neuro-symbolic framework based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) paradigm. This end-to-end framework aligns neural and symbolic components and performs systematic knowledge refinement. We introduce a balanced consistency metric to evaluate the predictions' consistency against both data and knowledge. Our results show that ALIGNED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest balanced consistency, while also re-discovering biologically meaningful knowledge. Our work advances beyond existing methods to enable both the transparency and the evolution of mechanistic biological understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality performance across languages requires substantial training data for each individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages, they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the usefulness of our approach.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood (NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch, post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants) consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for interpretability in machine learning, functional ANOVA decomposition has gained renewed attention as a principled tool for breaking down high-dimensional function into low-dimensional components that reveal the contributions of different variable groups. Recently, Tensor Product Neural Network (TPNN) has been developed and applied as basis functions in the functional ANOVA model, referred to as ANOVA-TPNN. A disadvantage of ANOVA-TPNN, however, is that the components to be estimated must be specified in advance, which makes it difficult to incorporate higher-order TPNNs into the functional ANOVA model due to computational and memory constraints. In this work, we propose Bayesian-TPNN, a Bayesian inference procedure for the functional ANOVA model with TPNN basis functions, enabling the detection of higher-order components with reduced computational cost compared to ANOVA-TPNN. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and demonstrate that Bayesian-TPNN performs well by analyzing multiple benchmark datasets. Theoretically, we prove that the posterior of Bayesian-TPNN is consistent.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

Abstract: Recovering a low-CP-rank tensor from noisy linear measurements is a central challenge in high-dimensional data analysis, with applications spanning tensor PCA, tensor regression, and beyond. We exploit the intrinsic geometry of rank-one tensors by casting the recovery task as an optimization problem over the Segre manifold, the smooth Riemannian manifold of rank-one tensors. This geometric viewpoint yields two powerful algorithms: Riemannian Gradient Descent (RGD) and Riemannian Gauss-Newton (RGN), each of which preserves feasibility at every iteration. Under mild noise assumptions, we prove that RGD converges at a local linear rate, while RGN exhibits an initial local quadratic convergence phase that transitions to a linear rate as the iterates approach the statistical noise floor. Extensive synthetic experiments validate these convergence guarantees and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning (STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts. This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization, and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings, demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face persistent challenges due to evolving cyberattacks, high-dimensional traffic data, and severe class imbalance in benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD. To address these issues, we propose IntrusionX, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling. The architecture is further optimized using the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), enabling effective hyperparameter tuning while maintaining computational efficiency. Our pipeline incorporates rigorous preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting to enhance the detection of rare classes. Experimental evaluation on NSL-KDD demonstrates that IntrusionX achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and 87% in 5-class classification, with significant improvements in minority class recall (U2R: 71%, R2L: 93%). The novelty of IntrusionX lies in its reproducible, imbalance-aware design with metaheuristic optimization.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a. Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast, editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media. Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

<title>Align Your Tangent: Training Better Consistency Models via Manifold-Aligned Tangents</title>

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent (AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at https://github.com/i-vesseg/MultiVesSeg.

<title>A Geometric Unification of Generative AI with Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Models</title>

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However, this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges, or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work, we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round. Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses naturally dominate the information flow.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope. Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design provides a principled framework for selecting experimental settings that maximize obtained information. In this work, we focus on estimating the expected information gain in the setting where the differential entropy of the likelihood is either independent of the design or can be evaluated explicitly. This reduces the problem to maximum entropy estimation, alleviating several challenges inherent in expected information gain computation.
  Our study is motivated by large-scale inference problems, such as inverse problems, where the computational cost is dominated by expensive likelihood evaluations. We propose a computational approach in which the evidence density is approximated by a Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo surrogate, while the differential entropy is evaluated using standard methods without additional likelihood evaluations. We prove that this strategy achieves convergence rates that are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art methods for full expected information gain estimation, particularly when the cost of entropy evaluation is negligible. Moreover, our approach relies only on mild smoothness of the forward map and avoids stronger technical assumptions required in earlier work. We also present numerical experiments, which confirm our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with many applications in various fields. Extending community detection to the temporal setting with exact temporal accuracy, as required by real-world dynamic data, necessitates methods specifically adapted to the temporal nature of interactions. We introduce LAGO, a novel method for uncovering dynamic communities by greedy optimization of Longitudinal Modularity, a specific adaptation of Modularity for continuous-time networks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on time discretization or assume rigid community evolution, LAGO captures the precise moments when nodes enter and exit communities. We evaluate LAGO on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently uncover temporally and topologically coherent communities.

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized the prediction of rigid protein structures, modelling the conformational ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) remains a key frontier. Current AI paradigms present a trade-off: Protein Language Models (PLMs) capture evolutionary statistics but lack explicit physical grounding, while generative models trained to model full ensembles are computationally expensive. In this work we critically assess these limits and propose a path forward. We introduce GeoGraph, a simulation-informed surrogate trained to predict ensemble-averaged statistics of residue-residue contact-map topology directly from sequence. By featurizing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations into residue- and sequence-level graph descriptors, we create a robust and information-rich learning target. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields representations that are more predictive of key biophysical properties than existing methods.

Abstract: The recently proposed Broximal Point Method (BPM) [Gruntkowska et al., 2025] offers an idealized optimization framework based on iteratively minimizing the objective function over norm balls centered at the current iterate. It enjoys striking global convergence guarantees, converging linearly and in a finite number of steps for proper, closed and convex functions. However, its theoretical analysis has so far been confined to the Euclidean geometry. At the same time, emerging trends in deep learning optimization, exemplified by algorithms such as Muon [Jordan et al., 2024] and Scion [Pethick et al., 2025], demonstrate the practical advantages of minimizing over balls defined via non-Euclidean norms which better align with the underlying geometry of the associated loss landscapes. In this note, we ask whether the convergence theory of BPM can be extended to this more general, non-Euclidean setting. We give a positive answer, showing that most of the elegant guarantees of the original method carry over to arbitrary norm geometries. Along the way, we clarify which properties are preserved and which necessarily break down when leaving the Euclidean realm. Our analysis positions Non-Euclidean BPM as a conceptual blueprint for understanding a broad class of geometry-aware optimization algorithms, shedding light on the principles behind their practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2 of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

<title>AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification</title>

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage, causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance, interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D (AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Abstract: Constitutive evaluations often dominate the computational cost of finite element (FE) simulations whenever material models are complex. Neural constitutive models (NCMs) offer a highly expressive and flexible framework for modeling complex material behavior in solid mechanics. However, their practical adoption in large-scale FE simulations remains limited due to significant computational costs, especially in repeatedly evaluating stress and stiffness. NCMs thus represent an extreme case: their large computational graphs make stress and stiffness evaluations prohibitively expensive, restricting their use to small-scale problems. In this work, we introduce COMMET, an open-source FE framework whose architecture has been redesigned from the ground up to accelerate high-cost constitutive updates. Our framework features a novel assembly algorithm that supports batched and vectorized constitutive evaluations, compute-graph-optimized derivatives that replace automatic differentiation, and distributed-memory parallelism via MPI. These advances dramatically reduce runtime, with speed-ups exceeding three orders of magnitude relative to traditional non-vectorized automatic differentiation-based implementations. While we demonstrate these gains primarily for NCMs, the same principles apply broadly wherever for-loop based assembly or constitutive updates limit performance, establishing a new standard for large-scale, high-fidelity simulations in computational mechanics.

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning deals with training a novice policy from expert demonstrations in an online fashion. The established DAgger algorithm trains a robust novice policy by alternating between interacting with the environment and retraining of the network. Many variants thereof exist, that differ in the method of discerning whether to allow the novice to act or return control to the expert. We propose the use of stochastic reachtubes - common in verification of dynamical systems - as a novel method for estimating the necessity of expert intervention. Our approach does not require fine-tuning of decision thresholds per environment and effectively reduces the number of expert interventions, especially when compared with related approaches that make use of a doubt classification model.

Abstract: This work introduces a new framework for modeling financial markets through an interpretable probabilistic state machine. By clustering historical returns based on momentum and risk features across multiple time horizons, we identify distinct market states that capture underlying regimes, such as expansion phase, contraction, crisis, or recovery. From a transition matrix representing the dynamics between these states, we construct a probabilistic state machine that models the temporal evolution of the market. This state machine enables the generation of a custom distribution of returns based on a mixture of Gaussian components weighted by state frequencies. We show that the proposed benchmark significantly outperforms the traditional approach in capturing key statistical properties of asset returns, including skewness and kurtosis, and our experiments across random assets and time periods confirm its robustness.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based network models provide fast and accurate predictions for complex network behaviors but require substantial training data. Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited, especially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers commonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are deployed in real environments. We propose a hybrid approach leveraging transfer learning to combine simulated and real-world data. Using RouteNet-Fermi, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset significantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom testbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay prediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and with 50 scenarios, by 48%.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups, enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle, seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g., WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months, flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries and about 6,000 parts.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other previous work.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size, and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without the need for domain knowledge.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary, natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap for future research toward making models more transparent.

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance, resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD (ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.

Abstract: Wind farm placement arranges the size and the location of multiple wind farms within a given region. The power output is highly related to the wind speed on spatial and temporal levels, which can be modeled by advanced data-driven approaches. To this end, we use a probabilistic neural network as a surrogate that accounts for the spatiotemporal correlations of wind speed. This neural network uses ReLU activation functions so that it can be reformulated as mixed-integer linear set of constraints (constraint learning). We embed these constraints into the placement decision problem, formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. Specifically, conditional quantiles of the total electricity production are regarded as recursive decisions in the second stage. We use real high-resolution regional data from a northern region in Spain. We validate that the constraint learning approach outperforms the classical bilinear interpolation method. Numerical experiments are implemented on risk-averse investors. The results indicate that risk-averse investors concentrate on dominant sites with strong wind, while exhibiting spatial diversification and sensitive capacity spread in non-dominant sites. Furthermore, we show that if we introduce transmission line costs in the problem, risk-averse investors favor locations closer to the substations. On the contrary, risk-neutral investors are willing to move to further locations to achieve higher expected profits. Our results conclude that the proposed novel approach is able to tackle a portfolio of regional wind farm placements and further provide guidance for risk-averse investors.

Abstract: We study in-context learning (ICL) of linear regression in a deep linear self-attention model, characterizing how performance depends on various computational and statistical resources (width, depth, number of training steps, batch size and data per context). In a joint limit where data dimension, context length, and residual stream width scale proportionally, we analyze the limiting asymptotics for three ICL settings: (1) isotropic covariates and tasks (ISO), (2) fixed and structured covariance (FS), and (3) where covariances are randomly rotated and structured (RRS). For ISO and FS settings, we find that depth only aids ICL performance if context length is limited. Alternatively, in the RRS setting where covariances change across contexts, increasing the depth leads to significant improvements in ICL, even at infinite context length. This provides a new solvable toy model of neural scaling laws which depends on both width and depth of a transformer and predicts an optimal transformer shape as a function of compute. This toy model enables computation of exact asymptotics for the risk as well as derivation of powerlaws under source/capacity conditions for the ICL tasks.

Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others. This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50% and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations, unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the project.

Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so, by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Abstract: This paper focuses on representation learning for dynamic graphs with temporal interactions. A fundamental issue is that both the graph structure and the nodes own their own dynamics, and their blending induces intractable complexity in the temporal evolution over graphs. Drawing inspiration from the recent progress of physical dynamic models in deep neural networks, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (GN-CDEs), a continuous-time framework that jointly models node embeddings and structural dynamics by incorporating a graph enhanced neural network vector field with a time-varying graph path as the control signal. Our framework exhibits several desirable characteristics, including the ability to express dynamics on evolving graphs without piecewise integration, the capability to calibrate trajectories with subsequent data, and robustness to missing observations. Empirical evaluation on a range of dynamic graph representation learning tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Recently, the Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT) problem has attracted the special attention of the ML community. In this problem, given two distributions supported on two (possibly different) spaces, one has to find the most isometric map between them. In the discrete variant of GWOT, the task is to learn an assignment between given discrete sets of points. In the more advanced continuous formulation, one aims at recovering a parametric mapping between unknown continuous distributions based on i.i.d. samples derived from them. The clear geometrical intuition behind the GWOT makes it a natural choice for several practical use cases, giving rise to a number of proposed solvers. Some of them claim to solve the continuous version of the problem. At the same time, GWOT is notoriously hard, both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, all existing continuous GWOT solvers still heavily rely on discrete techniques. Natural questions arise: to what extent do existing methods unravel the GWOT problem, what difficulties do they encounter, and under which conditions they are successful? Our benchmark paper is an attempt to answer these questions. We specifically focus on the continuous GWOT as the most interesting and debatable setup. We crash-test existing continuous GWOT approaches on different scenarios, carefully record and analyze the obtained results, and identify issues. Our findings experimentally testify that the scientific community is still missing a reliable continuous GWOT solver, which necessitates further research efforts. As the first step in this direction, we propose a new continuous GWOT method which does not rely on discrete techniques and partially solves some of the problems of the competitors.

Abstract: This article studies the Fisher-Rao gradient, also referred to as the natural gradient, of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) which plays a central role in generative machine learning. It reveals that the gap between the evidence and its lower bound, the ELBO, has essentially a vanishing natural gradient within unconstrained optimization. As a result, maximization of the ELBO is equivalent to minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence from a target distribution, the primary objective function of learning. Building on this insight, we derive a condition under which this equivalence persists even when optimization is constrained to a model. This condition yields a geometric characterization, which we formalize through the notion of a cylindrical model.

Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to reduce the computational burden of mobile devices and decrease the end-to-end inference latency in edge computing scenarios. While distributed DNNs have been studied, to the best of our knowledge, the resilience of distributed DNNs to adversarial action remains an open problem. In this paper, we fill the existing research gap by rigorously analyzing the robustness of distributed DNNs against adversarial action. We cast this problem in the context of information theory and rigorously proved that (i) the compressed latent dimension improves the robustness but also affect task-oriented performance; and (ii) the deeper splitting point enhances the robustness but also increases the computational burden. These two trade-offs provide a novel perspective to design robust distributed DNN. To test our theoretical findings, we perform extensive experimental analysis by considering 6 different DNN architectures, 6 different approaches for distributed DNN and 10 different adversarial attacks using the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: To enhance the computational efficiency of quantized Transformers, we replace the dot-product and Softmax-based attention with an alternative mechanism involving addition and ReLU activation only. This side-steps the expansion to double precision often required by matrix multiplication and avoids costly Softmax evaluations but maintains much of the core functionality of conventional dot-product attention. It can enable more efficient execution and support larger quantized Transformer models on resource-constrained hardware or alternative arithmetic systems like homomorphic encryption. Training experiments on four common benchmark tasks show test set prediction scores comparable to those of conventional Transformers with dot-product attention. Our scaling experiments also suggest significant computational savings, both in plaintext and under encryption. In particular, we believe that the ReLU and addition-based attention mechanism examined in this paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic encryption by avoiding the costly multiplication of encrypted variables.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of \textit{subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold}. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a promising solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet $64\times64$ dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model.

Abstract: This paper examines in detail the geometric structure of principal component analysis (PCA) by considering in detail the distributions of both unrotated and rotated MNIST digits in the space defined by the lowest order PCA components. Since digits possessing salient geometric features are mapped to restricted regions far from the origin, they are predicted by neural networks with a greater accuracy than digits that are mapped to broad, diffuse and overlapping volumes of the low order PCA space. Motivated by these results, a new quantity, the local PCA entropy, obtained by dividing the spatial region spanned by the low order principal components into histogram bins and evaluating the entropy associated with the number of occurrences of each input class within a bin, is introduced. The metric locates the input data records that yield the largest confusion in prediction accuracy within reduced coordinate volumes that optimally discriminate among geometric features. As an example of the potential utility of the local PCA entropy, a simple data balancing procedure is realized by oversampling the data records in regions of large local entropy.

Abstract: The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework enables privacy-preserving machine learning by aggregating responses from disjoint subsets of sensitive data. Adaptations of PATE to tasks with inherent output diversity such as text generation, where the desired output is a sample from a distribution, face a core tension: as diversity increases, samples from different teachers are less likely to agree, but lower agreement results in reduced utility for the same privacy requirements. Yet suppressing diversity to artificially increase agreement is undesirable, as it distorts the output of the underlying model, and thus reduces output quality.
  We propose Hot PATE, a variant of PATE designed for diverse generative settings. We formalize the notion of a diversity-preserving ensemble sampler and introduce an efficient sampler that provably transfers diversity without incurring additional privacy cost. Hot PATE requires only API access to proprietary models and can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing Cold PATE samplers. Our empirical evaluations corroborate and quantify the benefits, showing significant improvements in the privacy utility trade-off on evaluated in-context learning tasks, both in preserving diversity and in returning relevant responses.

Abstract: Back in the early 20th century, a horse named Hans appeared to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks during exhibitions in Germany, while it actually relied solely on involuntary cues in the body language from the human trainer. Modern machine learning models are no different. These models are known to be sensitive to spurious correlations between non-essential features of the inputs (e.g., background, texture, and secondary objects) and the corresponding labels. Such features and their correlations with the labels are known as "spurious" because they tend to change with shifts in real-world data distributions, which can negatively impact the model's generalization and robustness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this emerging issue, along with a fine-grained taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art methods for addressing spurious correlations in machine learning models. Additionally, we summarize existing datasets, benchmarks, and metrics to facilitate future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of the broader impacts, the recent advancements, and future challenges in the era of generative AI, aiming to provide valuable insights for researchers in the related domains of the machine learning community.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representation are essential for real-world AI systems. Deep ensembles of Gaussian networks have proven highly effective for continuous regression due to their ability to flexibly represent aleatoric uncertainty via unrestricted heteroscedastic variance, which in turn enables accurate epistemic uncertainty estimation. However, no analogous approach exists for count regression, despite many important applications. To address this gap, we propose the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN), a novel neural discrete count regression model that outputs the parameters of the Double Poisson distribution, enabling arbitrarily high or low predictive aleatoric uncertainty for count data and improving epistemic uncertainty estimation when ensembled. We formalize and prove that DDPN exhibits robust regression properties similar to heteroscedastic Gaussian models via learnable loss attenuation, and introduce a simple loss modification to control this behavior. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DDPN outperforms current baselines in accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art in deep count regression.

Abstract: Deep learning systems deployed in real-world applications often encounter data that is different from their in-distribution (ID). A reliable model should ideally abstain from making decisions in this out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on feature distances, such as k-th nearest neighbors and distances to decision boundaries, either overlooking or ineffectively using in-distribution statistics. In this work, we propose a novel angle-based metric for OOD detection that is computed relative to the in-distribution structure. We demonstrate that the angles between feature representations and decision boundaries, viewed from the mean of in-distribution features, serve as an effective discriminative factor between ID and OOD data. We evaluate our method on nine ImageNet-pretrained models. Our approach achieves the lowest FPR in 5 out of 9 ImageNet models, obtains the best average FPR overall, and consistently ranking among the top 3 across all evaluated models. Furthermore, we highlight the benefits of contrastive representations by showing strong performance with ResNet SCL and CLIP architectures. Finally, we demonstrate that the scale-invariant nature of our score enables an ensemble strategy via simple score summation. Code is available at https://github.com/berkerdemirel/ORA-OOD-Detection-with-Relative-Angles.

Abstract: Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TFPS, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS.

Abstract: Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on understanding the interaction dynamics between molecules, which is crucial for applications ranging from catalyst engineering to drug discovery. Despite recent progress, earlier MRL approaches are limited to using only the 2D topological structure of molecules, as obtaining the 3D interaction geometry remains prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a novel 3D geometric pre-training strategy for MRL (3DMRL) that incorporates a 3D virtual interaction environment, overcoming the limitations of costly traditional quantum mechanical calculation methods. With the constructed 3D virtual interaction environment, 3DMRL trains 2D MRL model to learn the global and local 3D geometric information of molecular interaction. Extensive experiments on various tasks using real-world datasets, including out-of-distribution and extrapolation scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DMRL, showing up to a 24.93% improvement in performance across 40 tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/3DMRL.

Our method compresses the original 124M-parameter GPT-2 to various smaller models, ranging from 80M to 96M. Our 81M model variant outperforms DistilGPT2 on next-token prediction across all standard language modeling datasets, and shows competitive or comparable performance with significantly larger Kronecker-based compressions of GPT-2.

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning technique, allowing clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing private data. However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of heterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution, which is popular in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages the mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent solution for federated learning under domain shift. However, existing federated prototype learning methods focus soley on inter-domain prototypes and neglect intra-domain perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel federated prototype learning method, namely I$^2$PFL, which incorporates $\textbf{I}$ntra-domain and $\textbf{I}$nter-domain $\textbf{P}$rototypes, to mitigate domain shift from both perspectives and learn a generalized global model across multiple domains in federated learning. To construct intra-domain prototypes, we propose feature alignment with MixUp-based augmented prototypes to capture the diversity within local domains and enhance the generalization of local features. Additionally, we introduce a reweighting mechanism for inter-domain prototypes to generate generalized prototypes that reduce domain shift while providing inter-domain knowledge across multiple clients. Extensive experiments on the Digits, Office-10, and PACS datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Collaborative learning (CL) enables multiple participants to jointly train machine learning (ML) models on decentralized data sources without raw data sharing. While the primary goal of CL is to maximize the expected accuracy gain for each participant, it is also important to ensure that the gains are fairly distributed: no client should be negatively impacted, and gains should reflect contributions. Most existing CL methods require central coordination and focus only on gain maximization, overlooking fairness. In this work, we first show that the existing measure of collaborative fairness based on the correlation between accuracy values without and with collaboration has drawbacks because it does not account for negative collaboration gain. We argue that maximizing mean collaboration gain (MCG) while simultaneously minimizing the collaboration gain spread (CGS) is a fairer alternative. Next, we propose the CYCle protocol that enables individual participants in a private decentralized learning (PDL) framework to achieve this objective through a novel reputation scoring method based on gradient alignment between the local cross-entropy and distillation losses. We further extend the CYCle protocol to operate on top of gossip-based decentralized algorithms such as Gossip-SGD. We also theoretically show that CYCle performs better than standard FedAvg in a two-client mean estimation setting under high heterogeneity. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CYCle protocol to ensure positive and fair collaboration gain for all participants, even in cases where the data distributions of participants are highly skewed.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) excel in zero-shot tasks but benefit from task-specific adaptation. However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a key technique for adapting large pre-trained Decision Transformers (DTs) in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly in multi-task and few-shot settings. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables task generalization via trajectory prompts sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations -- without accounting for prompt informativeness. In this work, we propose a bandit-based prompt-tuning method that learns to construct optimal trajectory prompts from demonstration data at inference time. We devise a structured bandit architecture operating in the trajectory prompt space, achieving linear rather than combinatorial scaling with prompt size. Additionally, we show that the pre-trained PDT itself can serve as a powerful feature extractor for the bandit, enabling efficient reward modeling across various environments. We theoretically establish regret bounds and demonstrate empirically that our method consistently enhances performance across a wide range of tasks, high-dimensional environments, and out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines in prompt tuning.

Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for forecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art models. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models, ensuring only the most effective updates are retained and improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our algorithms as open-source on GitHub

Abstract: Top-down images play an important role in safety-critical settings such as autonomous navigation and aerial surveillance, where they provide holistic spatial information that front-view images cannot capture. Despite this, Vision Language Models (VLMs) are mostly trained and evaluated on front-view benchmarks, leaving their performance in the top-down setting poorly understood. Existing evaluations also overlook a unique property of top-down images: their physical meaning is preserved under rotation. In addition, conventional accuracy metrics can be misleading, since they are often inflated by hallucinations or "lucky guesses", which obscures a model's true reliability and its grounding in visual evidence. To address these issues, we introduce TDBench, a benchmark for top-down image understanding that includes 2000 curated questions for each rotation. We further propose RotationalEval (RE), which measures whether models provide consistent answers across four rotated views of the same scene, and we develop a reliability framework that separates genuine knowledge from chance. Finally, we conduct four case studies targeting underexplored real-world challenges. By combining rigorous evaluation with reliability metrics, TDBench not only benchmarks VLMs in top-down perception but also provides a new perspective on trustworthiness, guiding the development of more robust and grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as the leading approach for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, it faces a fundamental compute and memory asymmetry: rollout generation is embarrassingly parallel and memory-light, whereas policy updates are communication-heavy and memory-intensive. To address this, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), which decouples rollout generation from policy updates by training only on a strategically selected subset of rollouts, maintaining learning quality while dramatically reducing update costs. We propose a principled subset selection criterion, max-variance down-sampling, that maximizes reward diversity, and provide an efficient $O(n\log n)$ implementation. Empirically, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with PODS achieves the peak test accuracy of vanilla GRPO at least $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ faster across the different reasoning benchmarks and hardware configurations we tested.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms. Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to 50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation ("forgetting") mechanisms that are inherently coupled to the time scale of state evolution. As forgetting is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on arbitrary time scales. We analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under a simple, flexible parameterization. Without introducing additional complexity, D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on long-range learning tasks, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.

Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so-called adaptive edge of stability regime during training, leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, and damping oscillations. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam, we create a powerful hybrid optimizer. For this optimizer, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis of operation at the edge of stability from a physical and control perspective for the momentum. Furthermore, we derive convergence bounds with the rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ for a stochastic non convex objective under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that VRAdam exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliable mathematical reasoning, and current verification methods are often computationally expensive. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), a highly efficient, lightweight post-hoc verifier designed to address this challenge. EORM uses an energy-based framework to rank Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions, learning to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning using only simple outcome labels, thus eliminating the need for expensive annotations. With only 55M parameters, over 127 times smaller than typical reward models, EORM boosts the accuracy of Llama 3 8B to 90.7\% on GSM8k and 63.7\% on MATH. This performance is achieved by efficiently selecting the optimal reasoning path from a pool of candidates, allowing it to match or exceed the accuracy of far more resource-intensive Best-of-N sampling techniques. Crucially, our experiments show that EORM generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution problems and unseen models, indicating it learns fundamental principles of valid reasoning. This robustness, combined with its efficiency, establishes EORM as a practical tool for deploying more dependable LLMs in complex, real-world applications.

Abstract: Concept-based explanation methods aim at making machine learning models more transparent by finding the most important semantic features of an input (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) for a given prediction task. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanations, such as the preferences of a listener. For example, medical doctors understand explanations in terms of clinical markers, but patients may not, needing a different vocabulary to rationalize the same diagnosis. We address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act. We introduce an iterative training procedure based on direct preference optimization where a speaker learns to compose explanations that maximize communicative utility for a listener. Our approach only needs access to pairwise preferences, which can be collected from human feedback, making it particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where a model of the listener may not be available. We demonstrate that our method is able to align speakers with the preferences of simulated listeners on image classification across three datasets, and further validate that pragmatic explanations generated with our method improve the classification accuracy of participants in a user study.

Abstract: We show that training a single $d$-dimensional steering vector per layer with reinforcement learning, while freezing all base weights, matches the accuracy of fully RL-tuned reasoning models on mathematical-reasoning tasks. On an 8 billion-parameter model this adds only $\approx 0.0016\%$ additional parameters and reproduces performance across a range of base models and mathematical-reasoning benchmarks. These results tighten the upper bound on the parameter budget required for high-level chain-of-thought reasoning, indicating that millions of adapter weights are unnecessary. The minimal trainable footprint reduces optimizer memory and inter-GPU communication, lowering the overall cost of fine-tuning. Moreover, a logit-lens analysis shows that the learned vectors amplify coherent token directions, providing clearer insight into the model's internal computations.

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers broader insights, such approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all these perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to realistic settings like AdamW. We empirically validate that a CNN and a Transformer are accurately replicated by this reformulation. Second, we derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature maps. Their effectiveness for parameter pruning is comparable to existing methods, demonstrating their value for model component attribution. Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking. Our findings support previously proposed stages of Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded, unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These ``hidden gifts'' represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus this act for others is a ``hidden gift''. We show that several different state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including MARL specific architectures, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that decentralized actor-critic policy gradient agents can succeed when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for policy gradient agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of ``hidden gifts'', and demonstrate that self learning-awareness in decentralized agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models, boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings. The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a finite discounted Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which leads to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and $\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$. We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on $|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds reveal that the PAC-bounds are tight in the parameters $S,A,\delta,\varepsilon$ and that unlike in the classical setting it is not possible to have polynomial dependence in all model parameters.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by transferring the knowledge from teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we first introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs-i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects probabilistically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Extensive evaluations on 11 datasets show that ActiveKD consistently improves performance across selection methods (e.g., +29.07% on ImageNet, averaged over methods). Under ActiveKD, PCoreSet ranks first in 64/73 settings (approximately 87.7%) across 5 student and 3 teacher networks, always achieving the best performance except for first 2 AL rounds. Our code is available at https://github.com/erjui/PCoreSet.

Abstract: We propose Guided Speculative Inference (GSI), a novel algorithm for efficient reward-guided decoding in large language models. GSI combines soft best-of-$n$ test-time scaling with a reward model $r(x,y)$ and speculative samples from a small auxiliary model $\pi_S(y\mid x)$. We provably approximate both the optimal tilted policy $\pi_{\beta,B}(y\mid x) \propto \pi_B(y\mid x)\exp(\beta\,r(x,y))$ of soft best-of-$n$ under the base model $\pi_B$, as well as the expected reward under the optimal policy. In experiments on reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math, MMLU-STEM, GSM8K), our method achieves higher accuracy than standard soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_S$ and reward-guided speculative decoding (Liao et al., 2025), and in certain settings even outperforms soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_B$. The code is available at https://github.com/j-geuter/GSI .

Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly finetuned for a variety of use cases and domains. A common approach is to leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) -- known to provide strong performance at low resource costs. In this study, we demonstrate that LoRA actually opens the door to short-cut vulnerabilities -- and the more resource efficient is the LoRA setup, the more vulnerable will be the finetuned model to aggressive attacks. To measure that vulnerability, we introduce Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI), where we find that LoRA exclusively focuses on even just a single token that is spuriously correlated with downstream labels. In short, injection of that spurious token during finetuning ensure that the model's prediction at test-time can be manipulated on-demand. We conducted experiments across model families and datasets to evaluate the impact of SSTI during LoRA finetuning while providing possible mitigations. Our experiments conclude that none of the existing checkers and preprocessors can sanitize a dataset raising new concerns for data quality and AI safety.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (ReFeri). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, ReFeri evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Abstract: Research on long-term time series prediction has primarily relied on Transformer and MLP models, while the potential of convolutional networks in this domain remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a lightweight variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improves efficiency but suffers from limited exploration and training instability, limiting its effectiveness on complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that augments GRPO across three dimensions: additional rollouts enable deeper and more targeted exploration, online filtering removes low-quality samples to stabilize gradients and accelerate training, and experience replay amplifies rare yet informative trajectories for stable convergence. This unified framework establishes a principled training cycle that balances exploration, efficiency, and stability. Experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame achieves consistent gains, including a 37.9\% relative improvement on Geometry3K over GRPO. EFRame further supports fine-grained sample categorization and precise entropy control, highlighting it as a robust solution for advancing deeper reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought, have emerged as powerful tools for reasoning-intensive and agentic tasks. However, as the time horizons at which these models can operate grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly difficult to know how much progress the model is making on a task, making it challenging for users to set appropriate expectations about completion time. By probing the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find evidence that their reasoning progress can be quantified, with simple linear probes achieving 30\% accuracy over 10 progress classes and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.75. Rooted in this insight, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning method that trains existing reasoning models to explicitly generate progress estimates (0-100\%) during their reasoning process. We find that the predictions of our best fine-tuned language model for sequences below 16K tokens are on average 10\% from the true label.

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in performance.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations. As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential. Code is available in https://github.com/ZhanliangAaronWang/FR-CCA-ADNI.

Abstract: This work presents a novel, fully Riemannian framework for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that geometrically treats low-rank adapters by optimizing them directly on the fixed-rank manifold. This formulation eliminates the parametrization ambiguity present in standard Euclidean optimizers. Our framework integrates three key components to achieve this: (1) we derive Riemannion, a new Riemannian optimizer on the fixed-rank matrix manifold that generalizes the recently proposed Muon optimizer; (2) we develop a Riemannian gradient-informed LoRA initialization, and (3) we provide an efficient implementation without prominent overhead that uses automatic differentiation to compute arising geometric operations while adhering to best practices in numerical linear algebra. Comprehensive experimental results on both LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that our approach yields consistent and noticeable improvements in convergence speed and final task performance over both standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) provides a parameter-efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods rely on task-aware inference and maintain a growing set of task-specific prompts, which introduces two major challenges: (1) severe performance degradation on earlier tasks under task-agnostic inference, and (2) limited scalability due to prompt memory accumulation as task sequences grow. In this paper, we present GRID, a unified framework designed to address these challenges. GRID incorporates a decoding mechanism that enhances backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Furthermore, it employs a gradient-guided prompt selection strategy to compress less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, ensuring scalable and memory-efficient continual learning. Extensive experiments on long-sequence and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID improves average accuracy and backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and substantially reduces prompt memory usage.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth. While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations. First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm. Supported by efficient parallelized implementations, our design achieves effective classification and highly discriminative state representations. We extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small reasoning models, scoring 64.5 on AIME24 and 50.2 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. While GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: first, the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; second, GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the assumption that no weights are clipped. Leveraging this bound, we design post-training quantization methods that avoid clipping, and outperform the original GPTQ. In addition, we provide efficient GPU inference kernels for the resulting representation. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on a firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform previously unseen tasks using task specific prompts without updating parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification. To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate $L$-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify that the Lipschitz constant $L$ of nonlinear function classes as a key factor governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether $L$ is below or above a threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of transformers for unseen functions.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth\_Xtended.

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy has made machine unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees or rely on heuristic metrics such as accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new definition for MU based on conformal prediction (CP), providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize the proposed conformal criteria that quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose empirical metrics to measure the effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in removing targeted data.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning jointly learns representations and values within monolithic networks, promising beneficial co-adaptation between features and value estimates. Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) has established diffusion policies as a high-performing paradigm for offline reinforcement learning, but its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation renders both training and inference slow and fragile. Existing efforts to accelerate DQL toward one-step denoising typically rely on auxiliary modules or policy distillation, sacrificing either simplicity or performance. It remains unclear whether a one-step policy can be trained directly without such trade-offs. To this end, we introduce One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables effective one-step action generation during both training and inference, without auxiliary modules or distillation. OFQL reformulates the DQL policy within the Flow Matching (FM) paradigm but departs from conventional FM by learning an average velocity field that directly supports accurate one-step action generation. This design removes the need for multi-step denoising and backpropagation-through-time updates, resulting in substantially faster and more robust learning. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that OFQL, despite generating actions in a single step, not only significantly reduces computation during both training and inference but also outperforms multi-step DQL by a large margin. Furthermore, OFQL surpasses all other baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in D4RL.

Abstract: LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such specialized models increases, merging them into a unified model without retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques operate at the level of individual layers, thereby overlooking the inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. We show that this simplification leads to distributional mismatches, particularly in methods that rely on intermediate activations, as changes in early layers are not properly propagated to downstream layers during merging. We identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training. To address this, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure that sequentially merges weights across layers while sequentially updating activation statistics. By explicitly accounting for inter-layer interactions, CoM mitigates covariate shift and produces a coherent merged model through a series of conditionally optimal updates. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Communication-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Federated LLM Fine-Tuning over Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However, transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods. Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the communication overhead further while providing richer representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead by approximately 50%.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes LLMs' internal computations remain unclear. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective. These vectors match full fine-tuning performance while preserving the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts and path-patching analyses on two models, we find that (i) the last-layer steering vector acts like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; (ii) the penultimate-layer vector leaves attention patterns largely intact and instead operates through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols; and (iii) middle layers de-emphasize non-English tokens. Next, we show that a SAE isolates features associated with correct generations. We also show that steering vectors (i) transfer to other models, (ii) combine across layers when trained in isolation, and (iii) concentrate magnitude on meaningful prompt segments under adaptive token-wise scaling. Taken together, these results deepen understanding of how trained steering vectors shape computation and should inform future work in activation engineering and the study of reasoning models.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest. We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

<title>Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection, Novelty Promotes Variation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing self-improvement approaches primarily rely on self-confirmation signals (e.g., confidence, entropy, or consistency) to generate rewards. This reliance drives models toward over-confident, majority-favored solutions, causing an entropy collapse that degrades pass@n and reasoning complexity. To address this, we propose EVOL-RL, a label-free framework that mirrors the evolutionary principle of balancing selection with variation. Concretely, EVOL-RL retains the majority-voted answer as an anchor for stability, but adds a novelty-aware reward that scores each sampled solution by how different its reasoning is from other concurrently generated responses. This majority-for-stability + novelty-for-exploration rule mirrors the variation-selection principle: selection prevents drift, while novelty prevents collapse. Evaluation results show that EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from baseline's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents in-domain diversity collapse but also improves out-of-domain generalization (from math reasoning to broader tasks, e.g., GPQA, MMLU-Pro, and BBEH). The code is available at: https://github.com/YujunZhou/EVOL-RL.

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss. Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to achieve an error bound $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation. Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing collapse.

Abstract: Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.

Abstract: We consider feasibility and constrained optimization problems defined over smooth and/or strongly convex sets. These notions mirror their popular function counterparts but are much less explored in the first-order optimization literature. We propose new scalable, projection-free, accelerated first-order methods in these settings. Our methods avoid linear optimization or projection oracles, only using cheap one-dimensional linesearches and normal vector computations. Despite this, we derive optimal accelerated convergence guarantees of $O(1/T)$ for strongly convex problems, $O(1/T^2)$ for smooth problems, and accelerated linear convergence given both. Our algorithms and analysis are based on novel characterizations of the Minkowski gauge of smooth and/or strongly convex sets, which may be of independent interest: although the gauge is neither smooth nor strongly convex, we show the gauge squared inherits any structure present in the set.

Abstract: One of the most promising applications in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which offer significant quantum advantages over classical machine learning in various domains. However, QGANs suffer from mode collapse and lack explicit control over the features of generated outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfoQGAN, a novel quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial network that integrates the principles of InfoGAN with a QGAN architecture. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit for data generation, a classical discriminator, and a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to explicitly optimize the mutual information between latent codes and generated samples. Numerical simulations on synthetic 2D distributions and Iris dataset augmentation demonstrate that InfoQGAN effectively mitigates mode collapse while achieving robust feature disentanglement in the quantum generator. By leveraging these advantages, InfoQGAN not only enhances training stability but also improves data augmentation performance through controlled feature generation. These results highlight the potential of InfoQGAN as a foundational approach for advancing quantum generative modeling in the NISQ era.

Abstract: A novel Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader type algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving general long-term constrained optimization problems in an online manner, where the target and constraint functions are oblivious adversarially generated and not necessarily convex. The algorithm is based on Lagrangian reformulation and innovatively integrates random perturbations and regularizations in primal and dual directions: 1). exponentially distributed random perturbations in the primal direction to handle non-convexity, and 2). strongly concave logarithmic regularizations in the dual space to handle constraint violations. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, and under mild Lipschitz continuity assumption, the algorithm demonstrates the online learnability, achieving the first sublinear cumulative regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic the human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnets better align artificial neural networks with human brain representations, making it more similar to human brain processing than traditional computer vision models, which takes an important step toward bridging the gap between artificial and human vision and achieving more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: PaECTER is an open-source document-level encoder specific for patents. We fine-tune BERT for Patents with examiner-added citation information to generate numerical representations for patent documents. PaECTER performs better in similarity tasks than current state-of-the-art models used in the patent domain. More specifically, our model outperforms the patent specific pre-trained language model (BERT for Patents) and general-purpose text embedding models (e.g., E5, GTE, and BGE) on our patent citation prediction test dataset on different rank evaluation metrics. PaECTER predicts at least one most similar patent at a rank of 1.32 on average when compared against 25 irrelevant patents. Numerical representations generated by PaECTER from patent text can be used for downstream tasks such as classification, tracing knowledge flows, or semantic similarity search. Semantic similarity search is especially relevant in the context of prior art search for both inventors and patent examiners.

Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.

Abstract: Attribution methods compute importance scores for input features to explain model predictions. However, assessing the faithfulness of these methods remains challenging due to the absence of attribution ground truth to model predictions. In this work, we first identify a set of fidelity criteria that reliable benchmarks for attribution methods are expected to fulfill, thereby facilitating a systematic assessment of attribution benchmarks. Next, we introduce a Backdoor-based eXplainable AI benchmark (BackX) that adheres to the desired fidelity criteria. We theoretically establish the superiority of our approach over the existing benchmarks for well-founded attribution evaluation. With extensive analysis, we further establish a standardized evaluation setup that mitigates confounding factors such as post-processing techniques and explained predictions, thereby ensuring a fair and consistent benchmarking. This setup is ultimately employed for a comprehensive comparison of existing methods using BackX. Finally, our analysis also offers insights into defending against neural Trojans by utilizing the attributions.

Abstract: Auctions are key for maximizing sellers' revenue and ensuring truthful bidding among buyers. Recently, an approach known as differentiable economics based on machine learning (ML) has shown promise in learning powerful auction mechanisms for multiple items and participants. However, this approach has no guarantee of strategy-proofness at test time. Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures that buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal and fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. In this work, we propose a formulation of statistical strategy-proofness for auction mechanisms. Specifically, we offer a method that bounds the regret -- quantifying deviation from truthful bidding -- below a pre-specified level with high probability. Building upon conformal prediction techniques, we develop an auction acceptance rule that leverages regret predictions to guarantee that the data-driven auction mechanism meets the statistical strategy-proofness requirement with high probability. Our method -- Statistically Truthful Auctions via Acceptance Rule (STAR) -- represents a practical middle-ground between two extremes: enforcing truthfulness -- zero-regret -- at the cost of significant revenue loss, and naively using ML to construct auctions with the hope of attaining low regret, with no test-time guarantees.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that allows an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific naturally occurring trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors.We demonstrate our attacks on multiple open-source LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our attack on an end-to-end black-box production RAG system: NVIDIA's "Chat with RTX''.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) stands as one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide, necessitating advancements in diagnostic methodologies for better clinical outcomes. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to permeate the healthcare sector, particularly in oncology, the need for transparent and interpretable models becomes imperative to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care. This review discusses the integration of various XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and others, with machine learning and deep learning models utilized in breast cancer detection and classification. By investigating the modalities of breast cancer datasets, including mammograms, ultrasounds and their processing with AI, the paper highlights how XAI can lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. It also examines the challenges in implementing these techniques and the importance of developing standardized metrics for evaluating XAI's effectiveness in clinical settings. Through detailed analysis and discussion, this article aims to highlight the potential of XAI in bridging the gap between complex AI models and practical healthcare applications, thereby fostering trust and understanding among medical professionals and improving patient outcomes.

<title>UTrace: Poisoning Forensics for Private Collaborative Learning</title>

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) systems enable multiple data owners to collaboratively train models without revealing their raw, sensitive data by leveraging cryptographic protocols such as secure multi-party computation (MPC). While PPML offers strong privacy guarantees, it also introduces new attack surfaces: malicious data owners can inject poisoned data into the training process without being detected, thus undermining the integrity of the learned model. Although recent defenses, such as private input validation within MPC, can mitigate some specific poisoning strategies, they remain insufficient, particularly in preventing stealthy or distributed attacks. As the robustness of PPML remains an open challenge, strengthening trust in these systems increasingly necessitates post-hoc auditing mechanisms that instill accountability. In this paper we present UTrace, a framework for user-level traceback in PPML that attributes integrity failures to responsible data owners without compromising the privacy guarantees of MPC. UTrace encapsulates two mechanisms: a gradient similarity method that identifies suspicious update patterns linked to poisoning, and a user-level unlearning technique that quantifies each user's marginal influence on model behavior. Together, these methods allow UTrace to attribute model misbehavior to specific users with high precision. We implement UTrace within an MPC-compatible training and auditing pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness on four datasets spanning vision, text, and malware. Across ten canonical poisoning attacks, UTrace consistently achieves high detection accuracy with low false positive rates.

<title>A Likelihood Based Approach to Distribution Regression Using Conditional Deep Generative Models</title>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the theoretical properties of conditional deep generative models under the statistical framework of distribution regression where the response variable lies in a high-dimensional ambient space but concentrates around a potentially lower-dimensional manifold. More specifically, we study the large-sample properties of a likelihood-based approach for estimating these models. Our results lead to the convergence rate of a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for estimating the conditional distribution (and its devolved counterpart) of the response given predictors in the Hellinger (Wasserstein) metric. Our rates depend solely on the intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the true conditional distribution. These findings provide an explanation of why conditional deep generative models can circumvent the curse of dimensionality from the perspective of statistical foundations and demonstrate that they can learn a broader class of nearly singular conditional distributions. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of introducing a small noise perturbation to the data when they are supported sufficiently close to a manifold. Finally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate the effective implementation of the proposed approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which also provide complementary validation to our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.

Abstract: Following their success in natural language processing (NLP), there has been a shift towards transformer models in computer vision. While transformers perform well and offer promising multi-tasking performance, due to their high compute requirements, many resource-constrained applications still rely on convolutional or hybrid models that combine the benefits of convolution and attention layers and achieve the best results in the sub 100M parameter range. Simultaneously, task adaptation techniques that allow for the use of one shared transformer backbone for multiple downstream tasks, resulting in great storage savings at negligible cost in performance, have not yet been adopted for hybrid transformers. In this work, we investigate how to achieve the best task-adaptation performance and introduce PETAH: Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation for Hybrid Transformers. We further combine PETAH adaptation with pruning to achieve highly performant and storage friendly models for multi-tasking. In our extensive evaluation on classification and other vision tasks, we demonstrate that our PETAH-adapted hybrid models outperform established task-adaptation techniques for ViTs while requiring fewer parameters and being more efficient on mobile hardware.

Abstract: Predicting electronic band structures from crystal structures is crucial for understanding structure-property correlations in materials science. First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation is a challenging task in digital communication. Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the renowned Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for directly estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Renyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most $2n+1$ with $n$ being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We prove that our loss function is operator-convex, ensuring that any local minimum is also a global minimum. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and observe the absence of the barren plateau phenomenon. As an application, we employ our algorithm to investigate the superadditivity of quantum channel capacity. Numerical simulations reveal new examples of qubit channels exhibiting strict superadditivity of coherent information, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning to address quantum-native problems.

Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.

Abstract: Calcium imaging allows for the parallel measurement of large neuronal populations in a spatially resolved and minimally invasive manner, and has become a gold-standard for neuronal functionality. While deep generative models have been successfully applied to study the activity of neuronal ensembles, their potential for learning single-neuron representations from calcium imaging fluorescence traces remains largely unexplored, and batch effects remain an important hurdle. To address this, we explore supervised variational autoencoder architectures that learn compact representations of individual neurons from fluorescent traces without relying on spike inference algorithms. We find that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, preserving biological variability while mitigating batch effects. Across simulated and experimental datasets, this framework enables robust visualization, clustering, and interpretation of single-neuron dynamics.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a practical and computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information of the model with respect to the parameters. Our approach consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance of the linear Gaussian model. This online covariance calibration stabilizes fitting and signals model inaccuracy. Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of mathematical content from natural language into machine-verifiable formal languages, has seen significant progress driven by advances in large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, a primary barrier to further improvements is the limited availability of parallel corpora that map informal mathematical text to its formal counterpart. To address this limitation, we propose ATLAS (Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data), a novel data generation framework designed to produce large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora of theorem statements. Distinct from prior approaches, ATLAS begins with a concept repository, accelerates the improvement of the student model through expert iteration combined with knowledge distillation, and introduces two novel augmentation strategies that exploit the structural characteristics of formal languages. Running the proposed ATLAS framework for 10 iterations, we construct an undergraduate-level dataset of 117k theorem statements and develop the ATLAS Translator by fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Instruct with LoRA. This model establishes a new state of the art, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over both the Herald Translator and the Kimina-Autoformalizer across all benchmarks (p<0.05, two-sided t-test). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the full-parameter fine-tuning of a stronger base model on the ATLAS dataset leads to superior performance. The datasets, model, and code are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/ATLAS.

Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.

Abstract: Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature and curated by domain experts. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for $\sim$320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits carefully designed to avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.

Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalizability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. First, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomizing Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multiscan multinoise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Second, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Third, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense skip connections, weight normalization, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.

arXiv:2503.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method. We release our code at https://github.com/bhimanbaghel/ResolveUnderOverEdit.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to electroencephalography (EEG) has great potential to advance both neuroscientific research and clinical applications. However, the generalisability and robustness of EEG-based ML models often hinge on the amount and diversity of training data. It is common practice to split EEG recordings into small segments, thereby increasing the number of samples substantially compared to the number of individual recordings or participants. We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research. The code for our experiments is publicly available online.

Abstract: Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis) of a previous study on Alzheimer's disease detection, which studied the robustness of logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) across patient sexes. We explore sex bias in skin cancer detection, using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset with LR trained on handcrafted features reflecting dermatological guidelines (ABCDE and the 7-point checklist), and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. We evaluate these models in alignment with the replicated study: across multiple training datasets with varied sex composition to determine their robustness. Our results show that both the LR and the CNN were robust to the sex distribution, but the results also revealed that the CNN had a significantly higher accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for male patients compared to female patients. The data and relevant scripts to reproduce our results are publicly available (https://github.com/ nikodice4/Skin-cancer-detection-sex-bias).

<title>Neural Theorem Proving: Generating and Structuring Proofs for Formal Verification</title>

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

<title>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.

<title>Ambiguity in LLMs is a concept missing problem</title>

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

<title>EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185</link>

arXiv:2505.12185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.

<title>AgentMisalignment: Measuring the Propensity for Misaligned Behaviour in LLM-Based Agents</title>

arXiv:2506.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.

arXiv:2506.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not faithfully reflect the original distances between clusters, practitioners frequently use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. We investigate why this misuse occurs, and discuss methods to prevent it. To that end, we first review 136 papers to verify the prevalence of the misuse. We then interview researchers who have used dimensionality reduction (DR) to understand why such misuse occurs. Finally, we interview DR experts to examine why previous efforts failed to address the misuse. We find that the misuse of t-SNE and UMAP stems primarily from limited DR literacy among practitioners, and that existing attempts to address this issue have been ineffective. Based on these insights, we discuss potential paths forward, including the controversial but pragmatic option of automating the selection of optimal DR projections to prevent misleading analyses.

Abstract: This study investigates minimax and Bayes optimal strategies in fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a sampling phase followed by a recommendation phase, and we design an adaptive experiment within this framework to efficiently identify the best arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our proposed strategy, the sampling phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, in which we allocate each arm uniformly in equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, arms are allocated in proportion to the variances estimated during the first stage. After the sampling phase, the procedure enters the recommendation phase, where we select the arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best arm. We prove that this single strategy is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that coincide exactly with our lower bounds, including the constant terms.

arXiv:2507.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

<title>MPCA-based Domain Adaptation for Transfer Learning in Ultrasonic Guided Waves</title>

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO and RUOD datasets to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.

arXiv:2509.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however, the success of these models is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language remains unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a step toward this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied to neurological imaging, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential. On two neurological MRI datasets, our framework simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis in 3D medical imaging. Project link - https://lesupermomo.github.io/imagining-alternatives/.

Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise trajectory tracking with quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that add degrees of freedom and hybrid dynamics. Classical model-based methods offer stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often fail to adapt when the configuration changes-when a payload is added or removed, or when its mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified learning-based control framework where a single reinforcement learning (RL) policy functions as an implicit hybrid controller, managing complex dynamics without explicit mode detection or controller switching. Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization across payload settings-including no payload as well as varying mass and cable length-without re-tuning, while retaining the interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller. Code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/mintaeshkim/roverfly.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at https://github.com/csml-rpi/Foam-Agent.

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AQuaMaM, a neural network designed to model complex distributions on the rotation manifold of SO(3) while efficiently calculating likelihoods in a single forward pass. AQuaMaM employs an autoregressive approach, modeling unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions to capture the intricate nature of rotation data. In experiments, AQuaMaM outperformed the implicit-PDF (IPDF) method in terms of test log-likelihood and efficiency, using fewer parameters and achieving a significantly faster prediction throughput. Training AQuaMaM on diverse datasets showed its ability to accurately capture the underlying distributions of rotation data, even in scenarios with ambiguous viewpoints. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AQuaMaM in learning complex, multimodal distributions on the SO(3) group, making it a promising model for various applications requiring precise modeling of rotation data. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex, multimodal distributions for rotations in three-dimensions, i.e., the SO(3) group, is challenging due to the curvature of the rotation manifold. The recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective approach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision. However, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's final multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood that can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those without the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In this paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning complex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact likelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM autoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted domain of values. When trained on an "infinite" toy dataset with ambiguous viewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely matching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for IPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF approaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When trained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different rotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF. Further, compared to IPDF, AQuaMaM uses 24% fewer parameters, has a prediction throughput 52$\times$ faster on a single GPU, and converges in a similar amount of time during training.

<div> Keywords: anisotropy, singular value spectra, low-bit training, language models, quantization

Summary:
This work addresses the challenge of low-bit training for large language models (LLMs) by identifying anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as a key obstacle. The domination of these spectra by a small number of large singular values leads to quantization bias and spectral distortion, resulting in degraded training performance. The authors introduce Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions the anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for more effective quantization. By leveraging sparse random sampling and random projection within the dominant spectral subspace, Metis minimizes computational overhead while improving training performance. Specifically, on the LLaMA-3 8B dataset trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust training with W4A4G4 quantization, achieving similar fidelity to BF16 but with lower computational costs. Furthermore, Metis outperforms an implementation of Nvidia's FP4 recipe in terms of loss and downstream accuracy. The code implementation for Metis is available for reference.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as the fundamental barrier to low-bit training of large language models (LLMs). These spectra are dominated by a small fraction of large singular values, inducing wide numerical ranges that cause quantization bias and severe spectral distortion, ultimately degrading training performance. This work presents Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for independent quantization, thereby reducing errors and preserving spectral structure. To minimize overhead, Metis leverages two key properties of the dominant spectral subspace: preservation via sparsely random sampling and preservation via random projection, reducing decomposition cost to a negligible level. On LLaMA-3 8B trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust W4A4G4 training with FP4 quantization of weights, activations, and gradients, yielding only a 0.4% training loss gap and a 0.1% degradation in downstream accuracy relative to BF16. Beyond matching BF16 fidelity, Metis also surpasses our implementation of Nvidia's recently announced (yet to be publicly released) FP4 recipe, consistently achieving lower loss and higher downstream accuracy while incurring significantly lower computational overhead. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Metis-quantization-644B.

<div> Keywords: grokking, 2-layer nonlinear networks, lazy learning, feature learning, gradient dynamics

Summary:<br /><br />
The study delves into the phenomenon of grokking, focusing on the emergence of features in 2-layer nonlinear networks. It introduces a framework, titled $\mathbf{Li_2}$, which delineates three crucial stages: Lazy learning, Independent feature learning, and Interactive feature learning. Initially, the model engages in lazy learning, leading to the memorization of random hidden representations. Through backpropagated gradient $G_F, each hidden node autonomously learns its representation, following the gradient ascent of an energy function. The study investigates the generalizability and representation power of these emerging features in group arithmetic tasks and explores the impact of hyperparameters like weight decay and learning rate on grokking. Furthermore, it presents scaling laws for feature emergence, memorization, and generalizability, elucidating the effectiveness of recent optimizers. The analysis also hints at the extension of these findings to multi-layer architectures. <div>

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) \underline{\textbf{L}}azy learning, (II) \underline{\textbf{i}}ndependent feature learning and (III) \underline{\textbf{i}}nteractive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize. Thanks to lazy learning and weight decay, the \emph{backpropagated gradient} $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation \emph{independently}. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the \emph{gradient ascent} of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

<div> Keywords: Feature extraction, Medical image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformer, Attention-based feature extractor

Summary: 
The proposed Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) aims to enhance feature extraction in medical image classification. MIAFEx utilizes a refinement mechanism within the Transformer encoder architecture to improve the extraction of salient features and adapt to challenges in medical imaging data. Compared to classical feature extractors, MIAFEx demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and robustness across various complex medical imaging datasets. Furthermore, MIAFEx outperforms modern CNN and Vision Transformer models, especially in scenarios with limited training data. The learnable refinement mechanism in MIAFEx allows for better generalization and adaptability, addressing the overfitting issues typically seen in traditional and modern models. This innovative approach showcases the potential for improving feature extraction techniques in medical image analysis. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

Regression models play a crucial role in recommender systems, but the retransformation bias problem is often overlooked in the field. Existing bias correction methods are often post-hoc solutions, posing challenges in real-world applications. This study proposes a preemptive approach to address bias intrinsically within models through minor refinements. The TranSUN method introduces joint bias learning, ensuring theoretically unbiased results with superior convergence.

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.

Abstract: We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships. While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles. We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets, achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic insights.

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches, such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels. However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE, a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning.

Summary:
This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds, particularly focusing on the PoincarÃ© ball. By extending the Hyperbolic Stochastic Gradient Descent to a Hyperbolic Adam optimizer, the study aims to improve learning on non-Euclidean surfaces. The optimization techniques are designed to facilitate the learning of PoincarÃ© embeddings, enhancing convergence in the initial training phases when parameters are distant from the optimal values. Using hyperbolic time-discretization of Langevin dynamics, the researchers apply these methods to train diffusion models. The results demonstrate accelerated convergence on specific datasets without compromising generative quality. <div>

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing generative quality.

<div> Keywords: heavy rainfall forecasting, deep learning, long-tailed learning, DPSformer, early warning systems

Summary: 
Accurate forecasting of heavy rainfall events is crucial for societal preparedness, but current models struggle due to the imbalanced distribution of precipitation data. To address this challenge, a new model called DPSformer is introduced as a long-tail-aware approach to enhance representation of heavy rainfall events. By focusing on events with rainfall of 50 mm/6 h or more, the model significantly improves the Critical Success Index (CSI) compared to baseline models. Additionally, for the top 1% coverage of heavy rainfall events, DPSformer achieves a high Fraction Skill Score (FSS) surpassing existing methods. This work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to improve early warning systems and reduce the impacts of extreme weather events.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge, we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem, identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h, DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

<div> Keyword: Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting, Adaptive Regional Boundary Optimization, Dynamic Monthly Forecast Allocation, Spatial-Aligned Attention, Temporal Mixture-of-Experts

Summary:
Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast) is an AI-driven framework that optimizes regional boundaries and allocates dynamic monthly forecasts. It utilizes a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism to align global and regional spatial distributions, refining boundaries based on attention-derived patterns. The Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module routes atmospheric variables to specialized experts using a Gaussian distribution, enhancing temporal pattern capture. STCast excels in global and regional forecasting, extreme event prediction, and ensemble forecasting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in all tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.25210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a deep learning framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution constraints. LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios with bounded execution durations. The architecture decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions, using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs) and Variable Selection Networks (VSNs) to process market data. Independent allocation networks handle specific execution logic for different scenarios. LEMs achieve superior execution performance on intraday cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture allows deployment across different execution scenarios through a single framework, providing operational advantages over asset-specific approaches. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies, LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons, similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders). This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework, providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering, to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Summary: 
- Deploying large pre-trained models on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression techniques.
- Recent works combine quantization with high-precision LoRA adapters to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.
- Edge devices have varying capabilities, making configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting computationally intensive.
- CoA-LoRA dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to different quantization configurations without repeated fine-tuning, improving efficiency.
- CoA-LoRA utilizes a Pareto-based configuration search to optimize the training configuration set, leading to precise low-rank adjustments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression. Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Summary: 
In the study, the researchers explore the phenomenon of double descent in machine learning, where there is a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold. They focus on predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. By varying model complexity along the axes of learner capacity and ensemble size, they find that double descent only consistently emerges when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, the generalization behavior reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. The results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, attributing double descent to the projection of distinct generalization regimes onto a single complexity axis. This highlights the importance of considering model complexity as a multidimensional construct in analyzing generalization behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work, we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity (e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour.

Summary:
Learning to condition (L2C) is a novel framework introduced for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in challenging Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). L2C trains a neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for conditioning, utilizing observed evidence. A scalable data generation pipeline is developed to extract training signals from existing MPE solvers' search traces. The trained network acts as a heuristic that can integrate with search algorithms, serving as a conditioning strategy before exact inference or as a policy within branch-and-bound solvers. Evaluation on high-treewidth PGMs demonstrates that the learned heuristic significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. L2C shows promise in improving MPE inference efficiency and effectiveness in complex graphical models.

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy. These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations. Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average inference time on the TinyML device.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4) an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates. This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Summary:
Residual Linear Attention (RLA) introduces a residual-fitting mechanism to linear attention, addressing the expressivity bottleneck by incorporating a recurrent state that accumulates residual errors over time for correction. Residual Delta Net (RDN) is a delta-rule version of RLA that incorporates adaptive gating and residual clipping for improved correction control and stability. Both RLA and RDN outperform their respective baselines and other linear-attention methods, narrowing the performance gap to standard Transformers while maintaining linear time and memory efficiency.

arXiv:2509.25223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net (RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS, reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios.

<div> marine energy systems, wind, solar, wave, forecasting, MVMD-LSTM <br />
Summary: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems offer a promising solution for clean electricity generation. A new forecasting framework, MVMD-LSTM, addresses the challenge of accurately predicting power output by considering the interactions among wind, solar, and wave energy sources. The framework combines Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to decompose the energy series, Bayesian optimization to optimize the process, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting. Experiments using field data from an integrated energy platform in China demonstrate the framework's superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy, robustness, and automation level, surpassing traditional forecasting models. The MVMD-LSTM framework shows potential for enhancing power-generation efficiency and resource utilization in integrated marine energy systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs, thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source, insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies, struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.

Summary:
Random Projection Flows (RPFs) are introduced as a framework for injective normalizing flows. They utilize random semi-orthogonal matrices from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles, allowing for efficient projection of data into lower-dimensional latent spaces. Unlike other methods, RPFs are plug-and-play, providing closed-form expressions for the Riemannian volume correction term. The approach is both theoretically grounded and practically effective, serving as a strong baseline for generative modeling. RPFs bridge random projection theory with normalizing flows, showcasing the potential of leveraging random projection techniques in the context of generative modeling. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and normalizing flows.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new method for learning temporal data trajectories by incorporating the inductive bias that trajectories should remain close to the underlying data manifold. Traditional flow matching methods rely on straight paths, while geodesic-based methods use RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs which can suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The proposed approach employs score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that accurately captures the underlying data geometry and improves flow accuracy. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, as well as in cell interpolation tasks. <div>

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation of cell

<br />
Summary: <br /> Time series forecasting is crucial in various applications, but traditional models may struggle with sparse data. The WDformer model proposed in this study utilizes wavelet transform for multi-resolution analysis of time series data, allowing for extraction of key information components across time-frequency domains. By implementing attention mechanisms on inverted dimensions and using a differential attention mechanism to focus on important information while reducing noise, WDformer achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets. The model's ability to capture relationships between multiple variables and accurately extract essential data characteristics makes it a promising tool for accurate and effective time series forecasting tasks. The code for WDformer is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain, it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.

<div> Gaussian Mixture Approximation, Unnormalised Target Densities, Weight-Only GMA, Laplace Mixture Approximation, Expectation-Maximization GMA

Summary: 
The article introduces a family of Gaussian Mixture Approximation (GMA) samplers for sampling unnormalised target densities. This includes Weight-Only GMA, Laplace Mixture Approximation, and Expectation-Maximization GMA among other variants. The GMA method involves a two-stage process: initializing a set of Gaussian components and sampling from a proposal mixture, then fitting the mixture to the target by optimizing component weights, means, and variances through a sample-based KL divergence objective. The method is gradient-free and computationally efficient, utilizing sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimization methods, and robust stratified resampling. Consistent approximations are achieved under mild conditions, demonstrated with empirical results showcasing accuracy and speed across various densities. <div>

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA), \textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e., FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity. Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

- A multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging is used for the printhead failure classification study.
- Machine Learning classification approach, specifically the One-vs-Rest Random Forest, was found to have the best performance among traditional ML classifiers.

arXiv:2509.25235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score for several failure mechanisms.

<div> framework, equipping, language agents, failure recovery, robust

Summary:
The proposed PALADIN framework aims to enhance language agents' resilience to tool malfunctions by training them on failure recovery strategies. Through the use of 50,000+ annotated trajectories and fine-tuning with LoRA, PALADIN is able to detect errors at runtime and execute appropriate recovery actions. The framework is capable of generalizing to new failure scenarios, achieving a high recovery performance of 95.2% on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation against baseline models shows significant improvements in Recovery Rate, Task Success Rate, Catastrophic Success Rate, and Efficiency Score. PALADIN outperforms existing methods, such as CRITIC, and vanilla agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling fault-tolerant agents for real-world tool environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose \textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution, retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR), and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57% relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%) by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in real-world tool environments.

<div> Reinforcement learning, large language models, curriculum learning, diversity metrics, Hamiltonian path 
Summary:
HAMMER is a novel schema proposed for large language model reinforcement learning that incorporates diversity metrics typically used in dataset evaluation. By ordering training samples according to a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path, HAMMER promotes exploration in the early stages of training, leading to improved generalization bounds and stable convergence. Empirical evaluations show that HAMMER enhances model curiosity and consistently boosts average accuracy by 3% to 4% across various inference benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2509.25240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering. However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics, commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<div> evaluation suite, model merging, language models, multi-task performance, knowledge retention
<br>
Summary:
MergeBench is introduced as a comprehensive evaluation suite for assessing model merging at scale. It includes state-of-the-art open-source language models like Llama and Gemma families at large scales and covers various domains such as instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding, and safety. The evaluation standardizes finetuning and assessment protocols and evaluates eight merging methods on multi-task performance, forgetting, and runtime efficiency. The results indicate that model merging performs better on stronger base models, with techniques like merging coefficient tuning and sparsification enhancing knowledge retention. Challenges include the computational cost on large models, in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard language model training pipelines. The findings offer practical guidelines for algorithm selection and highlight the potential of model merging in advancing the understanding and application of scalable model deployment.

Abstract: Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging.

Summary:<br>
1. Weak planners have a more significant negative impact on clean task performance in planner-executor MAS compared to weak executors.
2. A memory module is crucial for the planner's performance, but not as impactful for the executor's performance in clean task scenarios.
3. There is a trade-off between task performance and robustness in MAS.
4. Attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective in misleading the system.
5. The PEAR benchmark provides insights for enhancing MAS robustness and lays the foundation for systematic defense strategies in multi-agent environments. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

<div> augmented data, animal health monitoring, aerial drones, transfer learning, object-focused data augmentation

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring due to limited data availability and specific scene issues. Traditional transfer learning methods are unable to overcome these limitations as they lack large datasets reflecting farm conditions. To address this gap, the authors propose an object-focused data augmentation framework tailored for animal health monitoring in data-constrained environments. Their approach involves segmenting animals from backgrounds and augmenting them through transformations and synthesis to create diverse scenes, improving animal detection performance. Initial experiments show enhanced performance compared to baseline models. By generating domain-specific data, this method enables real-time animal health monitoring in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data availability and practical applicability. <div>
arXiv:2510.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

<div> Keywords: ICU mortality prediction, interpretability, clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, prognostication awareness

Summary: 
ProtoDoctor is a novel framework for ICU mortality prediction that focuses on both predictive accuracy and interpretability. It integrates three key elements of ICU decision-making - clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness - into its reasoning process. ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: a Prognostic Clinical Course Identification module and a Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The framework outperforms existing baselines in predictive accuracy and provides interpretations that are clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice. By combining demographic heterogeneity modeling with clinical course identification and prognostication awareness, ProtoDoctor offers a comprehensive solution for accurate and interpretable ICU mortality prediction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission, is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically, ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism. The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

<br />
Summary:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning (GAR) is introduced as a comprehensive training framework for solving math problems using verifiable languages such as Lean. GAR improves training efficiency by jointly training the problem composer and solver in an adversarial loop, incorporating an implicit curriculum learning mechanism to align task difficulty with the solver's capability. This approach enables stronger performance in proving advanced theorems, with experiments showing improved pass rates on benchmarks. GAR contributes to a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving in verifiable environments, going beyond formal proving methods. This innovative framework has the potential to advance the fields of mathematics and computer science by addressing the limitations of current state-of-the-art models and enabling more effective problem-solving approaches. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities. Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of 4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving under verifiable environments.

Summary:Node-level anomaly detection is a challenging task with various applications such as fraud detection and cybersecurity. In this paper, the authors propose Janus, a framework that combines Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture different aspects of node representations. By incorporating both original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, nodes are embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework with a contrastive learning objective aligns the embeddings across both spaces, effectively identifying anomalous nodes. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that Janus outperforms shallow and deep baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multiple geometric representations for identifying complex anomalies in graphs.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

<div> penalty function, stochastic dynamics, optimal solutions, generative AI, transfer learning

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of the soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem (SCSBP) as a more flexible approach to generative AI models. By replacing hard terminal constraints with penalty functions, the SCSBP offers greater stability, particularly in high-dimensional or data-scarce scenarios. The study establishes the existence of optimal solutions for varying penalty levels and demonstrates the convergence of controls and value functions to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate as the penalty increases. The analysis utilizes Doob's h-transform representations, stability results of Schrödinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument combining optimization over measure spaces with entropic optimal transport problems. These findings not only provide quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also highlight the role of penalty regularization in enhancing generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

<div> Efficient, Data Influence, Machine Learning, Training Data, Self-Influence<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new method for estimating the influence of individual training examples on the predictive behavior of machine learning models. The proposed method is highly efficient and requires only loss values of intermediate checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints themselves. It provides a zeroth-order approximation for estimating data influence, making it practical for large models and non-differentiable loss functions. The method achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large language models. This allows for scalable and practical analysis of how training data affects model behavior. <div>
arXiv:2510.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications, including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence, which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data shapes model behavior.

<br />Summary:\
Generative models are often paired with safety classifiers to filter out harmful outputs. Fine-tuning the generator to reduce the risk of being filtered can lead to an increase in false positives and false negatives. In response to this issue, the proposed method of Boundary Guidance uses reinforcement learning to steer generation away from the classifier's decision boundary. This approach has been shown to improve both the safety and utility of generated outputs in scenarios involving jailbreak and ambiguous prompts. Through comprehensive experiments across different model scales and reward designs, the effectiveness and robustness of Boundary Guidance have been demonstrated. This method offers a promising solution for enhancing the performance and reliability of generative models when paired with safety classifiers.\

arXiv:2510.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

<div> wavelet coefficients, diffusion models, multi-resolution structure, time series data, energy preservation<br />
Summary:<br />
WaveletDiff is a novel framework introduced for generating synthetic time series data by training diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients. This approach leverages the multi-resolution structure present in time series data by using dedicated transformers for each decomposition level and cross-level attention mechanisms for information exchange between temporal and frequency scales. The model also incorporates energy preservation constraints based on Parseval's theorem to maintain spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Testing on real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains shows that WaveletDiff outperforms current time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods across various metrics, including discriminative scores and Context-FID scores. On average, WaveletDiff achieves scores that are three times better than the next best baseline method, demonstrating its superior performance in generating high-quality, multi-scaled synthetic time series data. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting, classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation; however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$ smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Summary: 
This study explores the optimal replay ratios for adapting language models to new tasks while balancing task performance and knowledge retention. Using bAbi reasoning tasks, synthetic data generation techniques were applied with varying total token budgets and replay ratios. The research aims to find the configuration that maximizes task mastery and general knowledge retention. An optimal configuration was identified that effectively balances task-specific performance and general knowledge retention. The study provides guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation with reduced training costs. <div>
arXiv:2510.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation with significantly reduced training costs.

Summary: 
- The study evaluates seven cutting-edge vision-language models on their ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using various prompting techniques. 
- The evaluation is conducted on three benchmark sarcasm datasets to quantify the models' performance. 
- The models show moderate success in binary sarcasm detection but struggle to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific fine-tuning.

arXiv:2510.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2, InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting. Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm. Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific finetuning.

<br />Summary: 
This study investigates the impact of incorporating actor behavior information, modeled as time series, on the predictive performance of throughput time (TT) forecasting models in Process Mining. By analyzing real-life event logs, multivariate time series are constructed including TT and actor-centric features such as actor involvement, behavior frequency, and duration. Various models are trained and compared, with actor-enriched models consistently outperforming baseline models in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. The results show that incorporating actor behavior improves performance indicator predictions in forecasting models, highlighting the significance of understanding and incorporating actor behavior in process predictive modeling. <div>

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption, and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator predictions.

Summary:
- Knowledge graphs are structured triples used in various applications.
- Graph embedding methods represent entities and relations in low-dimensional vector spaces.
- Existing methods often make assumptions about missing triples, which may not hold true in real-world knowledge graphs.
- This work introduces a novel approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process.
- The proposed dual-model architecture improves predictive performance by training on both positive and negative statements simultaneously. <div>
arXiv:2510.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore, while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART) framework, designed to enhance the robustness of the Decision Transformer (DT) in adversarial stochastic games. The framework formulates interactions between the protagonist and adversary as stage games, incorporating stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on NashQ values from these games, CART generates policies that are both less exploitable and conservative to transition uncertainty. Empirical results show that CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently outperforms in worst-case returns across various adversarial stochastic games. This innovative approach addresses the need for enhancing adversarial robustness in reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.

<div> Keywords: Robust reinforcement learning, Adaptive Rank Representation, Policy optimization, Wasserstein ball, Low-rank manifold

Summary:
Adaptive Rank Representation (AdaRL) is introduced as a bi-level optimization framework for robust reinforcement learning. It aligns policy complexity with task dimensionality by adjusting the rank of policy parameters. AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball, avoiding overly conservative policies. By adaptively adjusting the rank, it balances the bias-variance trade-off and projects policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. Empirical results on MuJoCo benchmarks show that AdaRL outperforms fixed-rank baselines like SAC and state-of-the-art methods like RNAC and Parseval. It converges towards the intrinsic rank of tasks, demonstrating efficient and principled robust RL under model uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation (AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC, Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: user event modeling, machine learning, personal events, relational events, public datasets

Summary:<br /><br />
User event modeling is crucial in various machine learning applications, encompassing e-commerce, social media, finance, cybersecurity, and more. These events can be categorized into personal events, focusing on individual actions, and relational events, involving interactions between users. Existing methodologies often treat these event types separately, using sequence-based or graph-based methods. However, the real-world complexity necessitates considering both types together. To bridge this gap, this work introduces datasets that incorporate both personal and relational events, proposing a unified formalization. The empirical results demonstrate the benefits of integrating both event types into models while highlighting the potential for enhancements in current methodologies. By releasing these resources, the research aims to advance unified user event modeling and encourage further progress in this area. <div>

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance, cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this direction.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new method, VMoGE, for improving dementia diagnosis and staging using EEG data. Dementia disorders like Alzheimer's and FTD have overlapping EEG signatures, making accurate diagnosis challenging. VMoGE integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification with structured variational inference to differentiate dementia subtypes and severity stages. It employs a transformer to extract multi-scale temporal patterns and a graph convolutional encoder with Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. VMoGE outperforms existing methods in subtype classification and severity staging, with AUC improvements of up to +10%. It also offers interpretable insights through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures. VMoGE facilitates EEG biomarker discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.  <div>

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging, VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

<div> Keywords: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning, Locaris, Large language model, Calibration-free, Sub-meter accuracy
<br />
Summary:
Locaris is a decoder-only large language model (LLM) designed for indoor Wi-Fi positioning. It addresses the challenges of conventional fingerprinting and model-based approaches by ingesting raw Wi-Fi telemetry without pre-processing. Through fine-tuning on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals to device location. Experimental studies show that Locaris outperforms existing techniques, offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments demonstrate Locaris' high accuracy even with minimal calibration points, supporting any available telemetry. This compact LLM approach provides sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, maintains performance under missing access points, and proves practical for real-world indoor positioning, particularly in large-scale deployments where extensive calibration is impractical.

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP) measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization, offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios. This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where extensive calibration is infeasible.

This work proposes three efficient restart paradigms for model-free non-stationary reinforcement learning. The study identifies issues with the RestartQ-UCB algorithm by Mao et al., including complete forgetting and scheduled restarts. To address these challenges, the authors introduce three approaches: partial, adaptive, and selective restarts.

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$% relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Summary: <br />
Efficient Turing computability implies the existence of compositionally sparse DAG representations and neural approximants that achieve the target precision. If a function is computable in polynomial time, there exists a bounded-fan-in Boolean circuit computing the discretized map with polynomial size and depth. Replacing circuit gates with constant-size neural emulators results in a deep network achieving high accuracy. These constructions are related to compositional approximation rates and optimization through hierarchical search over sparse structures. <div>

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse} (bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if $f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy $\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to compositional approximation rates \cite{MhaskarPoggio2016b,poggio_deep_shallow_2017,Poggio2017,Poggio2023HowDS} and to optimization viewed as hierarchical search over sparse structures.

<div> disentangled representations, latent variables, variational autoencoder, programmable prior framework, Maximum Mean Discrepancy <br />
<br />
Summary: In the realm of machine learning, learning disentangled representations that capture distinct factors of variation through independent latent variables is a key objective. However, the commonly used Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty has been found to be unreliable in enforcing the target distribution on the latent space. This unreliability has been quantified using the novel Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address this issue, the Programmable Prior Framework has been introduced, utilizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to sculpt the latent space. This framework achieves superior mutual independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet while avoiding the typical reconstruction compromise. Additionally, the programmability of this framework enables the engineering of advanced priors that enhance alignment with semantically meaningful features. This work establishes a foundational tool for representation engineering, enabling advancements in model identifiability and causal reasoning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however, we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Summary:
Y-shaped generative flows introduce a novel approach to continuous-time generative models that move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to target-specific endpoints. The formulation uses a velocity-powered transport cost with a sublinear exponent, encouraging joint and rapid mass movement. Implemented in a scalable neural ODE training objective, Y-flows exhibit improved distributional metrics over existing flow-based methods and are efficient in reaching targets with fewer integration steps. Experimental results on synthetic, image, and biological datasets demonstrate that Y-flows capture hierarchy-aware structure and outperform strong baselines in terms of distributional quality. <div>
arXiv:2510.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport: each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows, which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, pretraining dynamics, trajectory-aware structural pruning, sampling acceleration, training-free diffusion acceleration

Summary:<br />
Diffusion models are powerful for generative tasks, but their pretraining phase has varied learning speeds that affect post-training acceleration efforts. The MosaicDiff framework introduced in this study aligns pretraining dynamics with sampling acceleration by using trajectory-aware structural pruning. This approach recognizes that different stages of pretraining require different pruning strategies based on learning speed. By adapting the pruning mechanism to match the learning variations, the model's training dynamics are synchronized with the accelerated sampling process. Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL datasets demonstrate that MosaicDiff significantly speeds up sampling without sacrificing output quality, outperforming previous methods. This novel approach provides a new perspective on efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration.

Summary: <br />
 <div>
arXiv:2510.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy. This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process. Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration.

Summary: 
In natural language processing, there is a need for a more mathematical framework to understand how each layer of Transformers contributes to the overall inference process. Inspired by the probabilistic nature of language models and the principles of quantum mechanics, the authors propose QLENS, a physics-based approach to studying Transformers. In QLENS, Transformers are represented as state vectors in a Hilbert space, evolving through hidden layers using unitary operators and Hamiltonians. The final probability distribution is obtained through the Born rule applied to the end state. A proof-of-concept study on a toy Transformer demonstrates the potential of QLENS in examining the impact of individual layers on a model's prediction trajectory. This work lays the groundwork for interdisciplinary insights that could enhance our understanding of Transformers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic, an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers - reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

<div> Keywords: Preference-based finetuning, Vision-language models, Cooling-Weighted DPO, Learning dynamics, Optimization

Summary:
Preference-based finetuning of vision-language models can be challenging due to the instability caused by incorrect negatives. In this study, a two-stage approach called Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO) is introduced to optimize the training trajectory efficiently. The first stage involves supervised finetuning with gentle negatives to regularize the base policy and prevent overconfidence. The second stage utilizes a Dynamic Path Optimization (DPO) objective where the negative term is scaled by a cooling weight derived from the model's average token log-probability on each negative, effectively suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution samples. By leveraging on-policy negatives and incorporating a mix of dataset negatives, CW-DPO leads to more stable optimization, improved calibration, and higher pairwise win-rates compared to existing methods. The cooling-weight mechanism is identified as the key factor behind these performance enhancements, highlighting the importance of smoothing learning dynamics before cooling preferences.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle: trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization} and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1} performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}: \textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight} computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize \textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness. Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle for robust VLM alignment.

<div> Keywords: neural dynamics, distributed learning, fixed points, supervised learning, hierarchical representations 

Summary: 
This study explores the gap between deep neural networks and biological counterparts by investigating neural dynamics that support distributed learning. The researchers identified conditions for robust dynamical attractors in random asymmetric recurrent networks, revealing a phase transition in the structure of fixed points based on self-coupling strength. They proposed a biologically plausible algorithm for supervised learning with binary recurrent networks, mapping inputs to fixed points through transient external stimuli and local plasticity. The algorithm demonstrated the ability to learn an entangled version of MNIST, develop hierarchical representations, and increase hetero-association capacity. The study also showed a strong connection between algorithm performance and the phase transition, suggesting a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for its emergence. <div>

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for its emergence.

Summary:
The study explores the use of second-order methods in neural network training compared to traditional first-order optimizers. While second-order methods incorporating the exact Hessian matrix are often hailed as superior, the research reveals that relying on precise curvature information can lead to consistent failures in neural network training. This unexpected outcome sheds light on the complexities of nonlinear discretizations and the distribution of stationary points within the loss landscape. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that the loss landscape predominantly consists of local minima, prompting a reevaluation of conventional wisdom in optimization strategies for neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2510.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples. Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by deep learning-based automatic sleep staging models in generalizing to unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals. To address this issue, the MEASURE framework is proposed, which focuses on reducing domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. This framework aims to bridge the domain gap by effectively aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Through rigorous experiments on SleepEDF-20 and MASS datasets, the MEASURE framework outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. By explicitly mitigating excess domain-relevant information, the proposed approach showcases improved generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios, making it a promising solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automatic sleep staging systems. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:  
This study introduces a framework for stagewise data attribution that considers the dynamic changes in influence between samples during neural network training. Unlike current static methods, the proposed approach accounts for non-monotonic shifts in influence, including sign flips and peaks at developmental transitions. Analytical and empirical validation in a toy model confirms the predicted patterns of influence changes, demonstrating a direct connection to the model's learning of a semantic hierarchy. The study further extends these findings to language models, where token-level influence shifts align with distinct developmental stages observed in the models' training process. This research highlights the importance of considering dynamic influence patterns in neural network learning and provides insights into the evolving nature of sample interactions during training.

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory. We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in language models, where token-level influence changes align with known developmental stages.

Summary:
Graph foundation models are important for learning transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Current methods that integrate graph and text modalities using contrastive learning face performance degradation at structural boundaries due to the limitation of assuming all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. GraphShaper addresses this issue by introducing a geometry-aware framework that utilizes multi-geometric specialization. By employing expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces and dynamically computing fusion weights, GraphShaper adaptively integrates geometric properties based on local structural characteristics. This approach leads to improved accuracy on citation and social networks in zero-shot settings. GraphShaper demonstrates the importance of respecting the intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures for enhancing graph encoding and alignment with text embeddings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20 percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce \textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

<div> Graph-text alignment, zero-shot learning, over-abstraction problem, fine-grained pattern recognition, H4G <br />
Summary: <br />
Text-attributed graphs are essential for zero-shot learning, but current methods struggle with fine-grained pattern recognition on heterophilic graphs due to an over-abstraction problem. This problem stems from operating at overly large hyperbolic radii, which compresses multi-scale structural information and leads to the loss of critical local patterns. Analysis in hyperbolic space reveals that optimal graph learning requires faithful preservation of fine-grained details. To address this, the H4G framework reduces embedding radii using learnable scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global receptive ability, resulting in state-of-the-art zero-shot performance improvements on both heterophilic and homophilic graphs. Radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation, advancing zero-shot graph learning efficiently. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However, existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation} of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%} improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs, confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Summary: 
- Scaling neural networks has been successful in machine learning but faces challenges in deep reinforcement learning due to optimization issues like plasticity loss.
- Existing studies on dynamic network topology adaptation in DRL have limitations in uniform training strategies, evaluation on basic architectures, and comparison between different dynamic approaches.
- Dynamic sparse training strategies show module-specific benefits that complement architectural improvements in DRL.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning, yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic modifications.

Summary:  
Chimera is introduced as a unified model that incorporates data topology in a principled manner, eliminating the need for domain-specific biases. By utilizing state space models, Chimera can capture any graph topology without the use of position embeddings or random walks. Experimental results demonstrate Chimera's superior performance across language, vision, and graph domains, surpassing existing models in tasks such as GLUE and ImageNet-1k. Additionally, algorithmic optimizations enhance Chimera's efficiency, including a linear-time recurrence for Directed Acyclic Graphs and a mathematical relaxation for general graphs that retains Transformer's quadratic complexity. These findings highlight the significance of data topology as a powerful inductive bias for diverse modalities.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm. Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

The article introduces GRACE, a novel Graph few-shot learning framework that addresses key limitations in current methods. GRACE integrates adaptive spectrum experts and cross-set distribution calibration techniques to enhance model generalization by adapting to local structural variations and complex distribution differences between support and query sets. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of fixed spectral operations and mismatched support/query set distributions common in existing methods. Empirical results demonstrate that GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various experimental settings. The code for GRACE is available for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods, several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However, under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically, GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that allows collaboration while protecting data privacy. However, it is vulnerable to intentional fairness attacks, where a malicious client sends a biased model to increase fairness loss. This attack can propagate bias among participants even with homogeneous data distribution. The proposed attack optimizes fairness metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds to increase bias without affecting global accuracy significantly. Evaluations against Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes show that the attack can successfully increase bias by up to 90% with just one malicious client in the FL system. This highlights the importance of addressing fairness and bias issues in FL systems to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of collaborative machine learning models.

arXiv:2510.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single malicious client in the FL system.

Summary: 
Budgeted learning in survival datasets involves acquiring labels for censored instances to improve model performance. The learner can pay to partially label censored instances, such as obtaining the actual time to event or gaining additional information about the instance. This mirrors real-world scenarios where follow-up with censored patients may not always lead to full information. The approach combines experimental and theoretical results, applying state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data. The method offers time complexity comparable to BatchBALD active learning. Empirical analysis on multiple survival tasks demonstrates superior performance compared to other approaches on various benchmarks. <div>

Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right) censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from (3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several benchmarks.

<div> reflection, language models, self-verification, reasoning, transformers
Summary:
Self-verifying reflection in large language models (LLMs) supports reasoning by allowing models to check the correctness of their solutions and explore alternatives. This paper presents a framework for small transformers that enables self-verifying reflection without natural language. Theoretical analysis shows that self-verification can lead to improvements if verification errors are controlled. Experimental results demonstrate that tiny transformers can achieve high performance in tasks like integer multiplication and Sudoku through self-verification. Reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances performance but focuses more on shallow statistical patterns than error reduction. Integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification can improve reasoning capabilities, regardless of scale or natural language.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion, integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

<div> Keywords: noisy labels, meta-learning, sample reweighting, label noise, training dynamics

Summary:
In the study of learning with noisy labels, the challenge lies in over-parameterized networks memorizing corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting offers a solution by utilizing a small clean subset to guide training. A rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise reveals three distinct training phases. These phases include alignment to amplify consistent examples, filtering to drive noisy example weights towards zero, and post-filtering where noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The analysis highlights a similarity-weighted coupling mechanism that contributes to the training dynamics. Based on this analysis, a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting is proposed, integrating mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation for improved stability and performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over strong reweighting/selection baselines.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines.

Summary:<br />

- DE3S addresses the challenge of accuracy and earliness by precisely identifying shapelets, discriminative subsequences in time-series data.

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units (ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, interpretable generative trajectories, Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion, multi-scale images, spectral analysis

Summary:
The paper introduces Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion, a framework that combines one-step sampling with interpretable generative trajectories in image generation. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, this method lifts nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions and eliminating iterative sampling. A hierarchical architecture disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. The framework provides competitive one-step generation performance and allows for interpretability and manipulation of the generative process through spectral analysis. This approach bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, enabling explainable image synthesis in generative modeling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.

Summary: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) integrated with large language models (LLMs) in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) allow rich textual semantics to enhance node representations. However, vulnerabilities in Graph-LLMs arise due to attacks on both graph structure and textual attributes. The Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA) framework orchestrates multi-level perturbations across both aspects, providing a human-centric adversarial approach. IMDGA balances interpretability and impact, showcasing superior effectiveness, stealthiness, attack robustness, and interpretability compared to existing methods. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, IMDGA uncovers vulnerabilities in TAG representation learning previously unexplored, offering insights for improving Graph-LLM resilience. The code and resources for IMDGA are publicly available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

Summary:
Molecular graph structures pose a challenge in integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs) in drug discovery. Existing methods often fine-tune the LLM or incorporate static adapters, limiting the model's ability to capture unique structural features and risking catastrophic forgetting. This paper introduces Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA), a dynamic instance-specific parameter alignment approach that generates low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph. These weights are injected dynamically into a frozen LLM, enabling the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecule while preserving core knowledge. Experimental results show significant improvements in key molecular tasks like chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning, with a 14.1% relative enhancement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in quantum property prediction error compared to statically adapted baselines. The code for MoRA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for quantum property prediction.

<div> performative learning, data distribution, regularization, ridge regression, over-parameterized, 

Summary:

Performative learning involves the data distribution adapting to the model deployed, posing a dynamic challenge compared to classical supervised learning. This study explores the role of regularization in addressing performative effects in high-dimensional ridge regression. It reveals that while performative effects can worsen test risk in the population setting, they can be advantageous in over-parameterized scenarios. Optimal regularization scales with the strength of performative effects, enabling preemptive adjustment for these dynamics. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real datasets highlight the importance of setting regularization parameters considering potential shifts in the data distribution due to model influence. By understanding and incorporating regularization to mitigate performative effects, the study provides valuable insights for effectively handling dynamic data dynamics in performative learning scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model - for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

This survey delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field. We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize the survey to identify promising future development directions.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called HiLoRA for adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. HiLoRA does not require explicit task labels or additional training, making it suitable for deployment. It selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level, refining routing at the token level by activating informative components. The framework guarantees the selection of the most relevant LoRAs with high probability. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to 55% over existing baselines while maintaining comparable inference throughput. HiLoRA's innovative approach offers a promising solution for adapting large language models to new domains effectively and efficiently. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence, \texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small $55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference throughput.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) called self-improvement, where models refine their policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. The current methods in NCO face limitations in terms of computational expense and the failure to exploit the structure of combinatorial problems involving multiple agents. To address these challenges, the authors propose extending self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions and employ a set-prediction loss to leverage agent-permutation symmetries. This approach enhances sample efficiency, accelerates solution generation, and improves the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Empirical validation on various combinatorial problems showcases the consistent improvement in the quality of final solutions and a reduction in generation latency compared to standard self-improvement methods.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries, we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared to standard self-improvement.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the General Fourier Feature Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (GFF-PIELM) to address challenges faced by conventional PIELM in solving high-frequency and variable-frequency partial differential equations. The GFF-PIELM integrates a variation of Fourier Feature Mapping into the ELM network, allowing for the capture of diverse frequency components.

Five case studies with ten numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of GFF-PIELM in handling high-frequency, variable-frequency, multi-scale, irregular boundary, and inverse problems. The approach significantly improves predictive accuracy compared to conventional PIELM without increasing training time or complexity. These results suggest that PIELM can successfully solve high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and the proposed initialization strategy could inspire advancements in other physics-informed machine learning frameworks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine (GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function, so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally, we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour, irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML) frameworks.

Safe policy improvement (SPI) in reinforcement learning (RL) ensures controlled policy updates, especially in online settings with world model and representation learning. A theoretical framework is developed to guarantee monotonic improvement and convergence by restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, providing online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from offline RL literature.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates, yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning (RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

<title>Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328</link>

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.

<title>Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12334</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in the static-reward case.

<title>Traveling Salesman-Based Token Ordering Improves Stability in Homomorphically Encrypted Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation, particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<title>Towards Cross-Modal Error Detection with Tables and Images</title>

arXiv:2510.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities. Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them, Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating further research in this area.

<title>Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs</title>

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

arXiv:2510.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon, requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

<title>Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.

<title>Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies. However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) -- a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue, while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

<title>A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and reconstruction fidelity.

<title>CrossAD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Cross-scale Associations and Cross-window Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

<title>PubSub-VFL: Towards Efficient Two-Party Split Learning in Heterogeneous Environments via Publisher/Subscriber Architecture</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency. Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency, while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2 \sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

<title>Mitigating the Noise Shift for Denoising Generative Models via Noise Awareness Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12497</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However, causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions, which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote its application in real-world scenarios.

arXiv:2510.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward. This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges -- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

<title>Rethinking Knowledge Distillation: A Data Dependent Regulariser With a Negative Asymmetric Payoff</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications. Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context, eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly under scarce labels and high missingness.

<title>Laminar: A Scalable Asynchronous RL Post-Training Framework</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency. Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization, allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

<title>Expert or not? assessing data quality in offline reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets, without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity. Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy. BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization. Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally, machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly, without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging, especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware) stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i) Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and (iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

<title>Structure-Aware Spectral Sparsification via Uniform Edge Sampling</title>

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs. Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated $k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) = \lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2 n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for structure-preserving spectral clustering.

<title>Keep Calm and Avoid Harmful Content: Concept Alignment and Latent Manipulation Towards Safer Answers</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM}, an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging \gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection, CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

<title>Demystifying Hybrid Thinking: Can LLMs Truly Switch Between Think and No-Think?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

<title>CoRA: Covariate-Aware Adaptation of Time Series Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

<title>Few Shot Semi-Supervised Learning for Abnormal Stop Detection from Sparse GPS Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git}

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.

We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.

<title>CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations. Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size $D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is, the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$ is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context, particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation, feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts (UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk task.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel, semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of proper losses.

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models (LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on 22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at https://github.com/cxcscmu/RePro.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction Diffusion Model (scPPDM), the first diffusion-based framework for single-cell drug-response prediction from scRNA-seq data. scPPDM couples two condition channels, pre-perturbation state and drug with dose, in a unified latent space via non-concatenative GD-Attn. During inference, factorized classifier-free guidance exposes two interpretable controls for state preservation and drug-response strength and maps dose to guidance magnitude for tunable intensity. Evaluated on the Tahoe-100M benchmark under two stringent regimes, unseen covariate combinations (UC) and unseen drugs (UD), scPPDM sets new state-of-the-art results across log fold-change recovery, delta correlations, explained variance, and DE-overlap. Representative gains include +36.11%/+34.21% on DEG logFC-Spearman/Pearson in UD over the second-best model. This control interface enables transparent what-if analyses and dose tuning, reducing experimental burden while preserving biological specificity.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information, through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents, including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced, Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]), outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code, thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural games.

Abstract: This work studies the feasibility of applying quantum kernel methods to a real consumer classification task in the NISQ regime. We present a hybrid pipeline that combines a quantum-kernel Support Vector Machine (Q-SVM) with a quantum feature extraction module (QFE), and benchmark it against classical and quantum baselines in simulation and with limited shallow-depth hardware runs. With fixed hyperparameters, the proposed Q-SVM attains 0.7790 accuracy, 0.7647 precision, 0.8609 recall, 0.8100 F1, and 0.83 ROC AUC, exhibiting higher sensitivity while maintaining competitive precision relative to classical SVM. We interpret these results as an initial indicator and a concrete starting point for NISQ-era workflows and hardware integration, rather than a definitive benchmark. Methodologically, our design aligns with recent work that formalizes quantum-classical separations and verifies resources via XEB-style approaches, motivating shallow yet expressive quantum embeddings to achieve robust separability despite hardware noise constraints.

<title>PRISM: Enhancing Protein Inverse Folding through Fine-Grained Retrieval on Structure-Sequence Multimodal Representations</title>

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.

Abstract: Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions. Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design. Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at https://github.com/ZW471/PLASMA-Protein-Local-Alignment.git.

Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight matrix and a non-linear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is $M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ with $M$ being the sample size, depending only on the smoothness $\beta$ of the activation, and crucially independent of token count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix. These results highlight a fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency of attention-style nonlocal models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately identifiable and provide a theoretical understanding of the attention mechanism and its training.

<title>On Thompson Sampling and Bilateral Uncertainty in Additive Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: In Bayesian Optimization (BO), additive assumptions can mitigate the twin difficulties of modeling and searching a complex function in high dimension. However, common acquisition functions, like the Additive Lower Confidence Bound, ignore pairwise covariances between dimensions, which we'll call \textit{bilateral uncertainty} (BU), imposing a second layer of approximations. While theoretical results indicate that asymptotically not much is lost in doing so, little is known about the practical effects of this assumption in small budgets. In this article, we show that by exploiting conditional independence, Thompson Sampling respecting BU can be efficiently conducted. We use this fact to execute an empirical investigation into the loss incurred by ignoring BU, finding that the additive approximation to Thompson Sampling does indeed have, on balance, worse performance than the exact method, but that this difference is of little practical significance. This buttresses the theoretical understanding and suggests that the BU-ignoring approximation is sufficient for BO in practice, even in the non-asymptotic regime.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

<title>Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?</title>

arXiv:2510.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.

In this article, we extend this methodology to real-valued functionals on Hilbert space. We define an operator which coincides with the active subspace matrix when applied to a Euclidean space. We show that many of the desirable properties of Active Subspace analysis extend directly to the infinite dimensional setting. We also propose a Monte Carlo procedure and discuss its convergence properties. Finally, we deploy this methodology to create visualizations and improve modeling and optimization on complex test problems.

Abstract: We study statistical estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) when users may hold heterogeneous privacy levels and accuracy must be guaranteed with high probability. Departing from the common in-expectation analyses, and for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation problems, we develop finite sample upper bounds in $\ell_2$-norm that hold with probability at least $1-\beta$. We complement these results with matching minimax lower bounds, establishing the optimality (up to constants) of our guarantees in the heterogeneous LDP regime. We further study distribution learning in $\ell_\infty$-distance, designing an algorithm with high-probability guarantees under heterogeneous privacy demands. Our techniques offer principled guidance for designing mechanisms in settings with user-specific privacy levels.

<title>LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance</title>

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Abstract: We propose a new general framework for recovering low-rank structure in optimal transport using Schatten-$p$ norm regularization. Our approach extends existing methods that promote sparse and interpretable transport maps or plans, while providing a unified and principled family of convex programs that encourage low-dimensional structure. The convexity of our formulation enables direct theoretical analysis: we derive optimality conditions and prove recovery guarantees for low-rank couplings and barycentric maps in simplified settings. To efficiently solve the proposed program, we develop a mirror descent algorithm with convergence guarantees for $p \geq 1$. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the method's efficiency, scalability, and ability to recover low-rank transport structures.

Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate, using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning. Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed by subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its Ruppert-Polyak averaged variant (ASGD) lie at the heart of modern large-scale learning, yet their theoretical properties in high-dimensional settings are rarely understood. In this paper, we provide rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and ASGD in high-dimensional regimes. Our key innovation is to transfer powerful tools from high-dimensional time series to online learning. Specifically, by viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting existing coupling techniques, we prove the geometric-moment contraction of high-dimensional SGD for constant learning rates, thereby establishing asymptotic stationarity of the iterates. Building on this, we derive the $q$-th moment convergence of SGD and ASGD for any $q\ge2$ in general $\ell^s$-norms, and, in particular, the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm that is frequently adopted in high-dimensional sparse or structured models. Furthermore, we provide sharp high-probability concentration analysis which entails the probabilistic bound of high-dimensional ASGD. Beyond closing a critical gap in SGD theory, our proposed framework offers a novel toolkit for analyzing a broad class of high-dimensional learning algorithms.

<title>Embedding the Teacher: Distilling vLLM Preferences for Scalable Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Text--image retrieval is necessary for applications such as product recommendation. Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient large-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily trained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture abstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation applications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast, state-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in a flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly handling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills the preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system, transferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the inference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on persona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an efficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval.

<title>CPR: Mitigating Large Language Model Hallucinations with Curative Prompt Refinement</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

<title>MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation</title>

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.

<title>AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066</link>

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.

Abstract: We study neural network compressibility by using singular learning theory to extend the minimum description length (MDL) principle to singular models like neural networks. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia suite with quantization, factorization, and other compression techniques, we find that complexity estimates based on the local learning coefficient (LLC) are closely, and in some cases, linearly correlated with compressibility. Our results provide a path toward rigorously evaluating the limits of model compression.

<title>FedLoDrop: Federated LoRA with Dropout for Generalized LLM Fine-tuning</title>

arXiv:2510.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B\&amp;B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability.

<title>One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic Environments from Unguided Exploration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.

Abstract: Chatbot providers (e.g., OpenAI) rely on tiered subscription schemes to generate revenue, offering basic models for free users, and advanced models for paying subscribers. However, a finer-grained pay-to-unlock scheme for premium features (e.g., math, coding) is thought to be more economically viable for the providers. Such a scheme requires a feature-locking technique (FLoTE) which is (i) effective in refusing locked features, (ii) utility-preserving for unlocked features, (iii) robust against evasion or unauthorized credential sharing, and (iv) scalable to multiple features and users. However, existing FLoTEs (e.g., password-locked models) are not robust or scalable. We present Locket, the first robust and scalable FLoTE to enable pay-to-unlock schemes. Locket uses a novel merging approach to attach adapters to an LLM for refusing unauthorized features. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Locket is effective ($100$% refusal on locked features), utility-preserving ($\leq 7$% utility degradation in unlocked features), robust ($\leq 5$% attack success rate), and scales to multiple features and clients.

<title>Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via Targeted Representation Editing</title>

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

Abstract: This study employs a neural network that represents the solution to a Schr\"odinger bridge problem to perform super-resolution of 2-m temperature in an urban area. Schr\"odinger bridges generally describe transformations between two data distributions based on diffusion processes. We use a specific Schr\"odinger-bridge model (SM) that directly transforms low-resolution data into high-resolution data, unlike denoising diffusion probabilistic models (simply, diffusion models; DMs) that generate high-resolution data from Gaussian noise. Low-resolution and high-resolution data were obtained from separate numerical simulations with a physics-based model under common initial and boundary conditions. Compared with a DM, the SM attains comparable accuracy at one-fifth the computational cost, requiring 50 neural-network evaluations per datum for the DM and only 10 for the SM. Furthermore, high-resolution samples generated by the SM exhibit larger variance, implying superior uncertainty quantification relative to the DM. Owing to the reduced computational cost of the SM, our results suggest the feasibility of real-time ensemble micrometeorological prediction using SM-based super-resolution.

Abstract: We study the decoupled multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where the learner selects one arm for exploration and one arm for exploitation in each round. The loss of the explored arm is observed but not counted, while the loss of the exploited arm is incurred without being observed. We propose a policy within the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations. Our policy achieves (near-)optimal regret regardless of the environment, i.e., Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW): constant regret in the stochastic regime, improving upon the optimal bound of the standard MABs, and minimax optimal regret in the adversarial regime. Moreover, the practicality of our policy stems from avoiding both the convex optimization step required by the previous BOBW policy, Decoupled-Tsallis-INF (Rouyer & Seldin, 2020), and the resampling step that is typically necessary in FTPL. Consequently, it achieves substantial computational improvement, about $20$ times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF, while also demonstrating better empirical performance in both regimes. Finally, we empirically show that our approach outperforms a pure exploration policy, and that naively combining a pure exploration with a standard exploitation policy is suboptimal.

Abstract: We propose the Mean-Field Actor-Critic (MFAC) flow, a continuous-time learning dynamics for solving mean-field games (MFGs), combining techniques from reinforcement learning and optimal transport. The MFAC framework jointly evolves the control (actor), value function (critic), and distribution components through coupled gradient-based updates governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). A central innovation is the Optimal Transport Geodesic Picard (OTGP) flow, which drives the distribution toward equilibrium along Wasserstein-2 geodesics. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis using Lyapunov functionals and establish global exponential convergence of the MFAC flow under a suitable timescale. Our results highlight the algorithmic interplay among actor, critic, and distribution components. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MFAC framework in computing MFG equilibria.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse, safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However, controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA) remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different collision scenarios.

Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are provided on https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DiSTAR_demo.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c) scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse. Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Abstract: Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing optimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80% overhead reduction.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Abstract: Accurate intraday forecasts are essential for power system operations, complementing day-ahead forecasts that gradually lose relevance as new information becomes available. This paper introduces a Bayesian updating mechanism that converts fully probabilistic day-ahead forecasts into intraday forecasts without retraining or re-inference. The approach conditions the Gaussian mixture output of a conditional variational autoencoder-based forecaster on observed measurements, yielding an updated distribution for the remaining horizon that preserves its probabilistic structure. This enables consistent point, quantile, and ensemble forecasts while remaining computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. Experiments on household electricity consumption and photovoltaic generation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves forecast accuracy up to 25% across likelihood-, sample-, quantile-, and point-based metrics. The largest gains occur in time steps with strong temporal correlation to observed data, and the use of pattern dictionary-based covariance structures further enhances performance. The results highlight a theoretically grounded framework for intraday forecasting in modern power systems.

<title>Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.

<title>DeepTrust: Multi-Step Classification through Dissimilar Adversarial Representations for Robust Android Malware Detection</title>

Abstract: Over the last decade, machine learning has been extensively applied to identify malicious Android applications. However, such approaches remain vulnerable against adversarial examples, i.e., examples that are subtly manipulated to fool a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions. This research presents DeepTrust, a novel metaheuristic that arranges flexible classifiers, like deep neural networks, into an ordered sequence where the final decision is made by a single internal model based on conditions activated in cascade. In the Robust Android Malware Detection competition at the 2025 IEEE Conference SaTML, DeepTrust secured the first place and achieved state-of-the-art results, outperforming the next-best competitor by up to 266% under feature-space evasion attacks. This is accomplished while maintaining the highest detection rate on non-adversarial malware and a false positive rate below 1%. The method's efficacy stems from maximizing the divergence of the learned representations among the internal models. By using classifiers inducing fundamentally dissimilar embeddings of the data, the decision space becomes unpredictable for an attacker. This frustrates the iterative perturbation process inherent to evasion attacks, enhancing system robustness without compromising accuracy on clean examples.

Abstract: We develop interacting particle algorithms for learning latent variable models with energy-based priors. To do so, we leverage recent developments in particle-based methods for solving maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) problems. Specifically, we provide a continuous-time framework for learning latent energy-based models, by defining stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that provably solve the MMLE problem. We obtain a practical algorithm as a discretisation of these SDEs and provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method on synthetic and image datasets.

<title>Pretraining in Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Robot Motion Control</title>

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Constrained Sensing and Reliable State Estimation with Shallow Recurrent Decoders on a TRIGA Mark II Reactor</title>

Abstract: Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.

Abstract: In this paper, we refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for the multivariate normal approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates arising from the linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. We consider the normal approximation by the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix predicted by the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem and establish the rate up to order $n^{-1/3}$ in convex distance, where $n$ is the number of samples used in the algorithm. We also prove a non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the rescaled error of the averaged LSA estimator. We establish approximation rates of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$ for the latter distribution, which significantly improves upon the previous results obtained by Samsonov et al. (2024).

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance, these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks, not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive. Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions.

Abstract: In the last decade, video workflows in the cinema production ecosystem have presented new use cases for video streaming technology. These new workflows, e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise quality control and energy efficiency. Existing approaches to transcoding often fall short of these requirements, either due to a lack of quality control or computational overhead. To fill this gap, we present a lightweight neural network (LiteVPNet) for accurately predicting Quantisation Parameters for NVENC AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets. Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods. LiteVPNet's performance across various quality regions highlights its applicability for enhancing high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient, high-quality media experiences.

<title>Improving Generative Behavior Cloning via Self-Guidance and Adaptive Chunking</title>

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1) self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking, which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42 countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially, their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity, as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.

Abstract: Translating a general quantum circuit on a specific hardware topology with a reduced set of available gates, also known as transpilation, comes with a substantial increase in the length of the equivalent circuit. Due to decoherence, the quality of the computational outcome can degrade seriously with increasing circuit length. Thus, there is major interest to reduce a quantum circuit to an equivalent circuit which is in its gate count as short as possible. One method to address efficient transpilation is based on approaches known from stochastic optimization, e.g. by using random sampling and token replacement strategies. Here, a core challenge is that these methods can suffer from sampling efficiency, causing long and energy consuming optimization time. As a remedy, we propose in this work 2D neural guided sampling. Thus, given a 2D representation of a quantum circuit, a neural network predicts groups of gates in the quantum circuit, which are likely reducible. Thus, it leads to a sampling prior which can heavily reduce the compute time for quantum circuit reduction. In several experiments, we demonstrate that our method is superior to results obtained from different qiskit or BQSKit optimization levels.

Abstract: We present a formal framework for context-aware security verification that establishes provable guarantees for ML-enhanced adaptive systems. We introduce context-completeness - a new security property - and prove: (1) sample complexity bounds showing when adaptive verification succeeds, (2) information-theoretic limits relating context richness to detection capability, (3) convergence guarantees for ML-based payload generators, and (4) compositional soundness bounds. We further provide a formal separation between static context-blind verifiers and context-aware adaptive verifiers: for a natural family of targets, any static verifier with finite payload budget achieves completeness at most alpha, while a context-aware verifier with sufficient information achieves completeness greater than alpha. We validate our theoretical predictions through controlled experiments on 97,224 exploit samples, demonstrating: detection accuracy improving from 58% to 69.93% with dataset growth, success probability increasing from 51% to 82% with context enrichment, training loss converging at O(1/sqrt(T)) rate, and false positive rate (10.19%) within theoretical bounds (12%). Our results show that theoretically-grounded adaptive verification achieves provable improvements over static approaches under stated assumptions while maintaining soundness guarantees.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Abstract: Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.

Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of learning effective regularizers for linear inverse problems. We analyze and compare several types of learned variational regularization against the theoretical benchmark of the optimal affine reconstruction, i.e. the best possible affine linear map for minimizing the mean squared error. It is known that this optimal reconstruction can be achieved using Tikhonov regularization, but this requires precise knowledge of the noise covariance to properly weight the data fidelity term. However, in many practical applications, noise statistics are unknown. We therefore investigate the performance of regularization methods learned without access to this noise information, focusing on Tikhonov, Lavrentiev, and quadratic regularization. Our theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that for non-white noise, a performance gap emerges between these methods and the optimal affine reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that these different types of regularization yield distinct results, highlighting that the choice of regularizer structure is critical when the noise model is not explicitly learned. Our findings underscore the significant value of accurately modeling or co-learning noise statistics in data-driven regularization.

Abstract: An open problem in Machine Learning is how to avoid models to exploit spurious correlations in the data; a famous example is the background-label shortcut in the Waterbirds dataset. A common remedy is to train a model across multiple environments; in the Waterbirds dataset, this corresponds to training by randomizing the background. However, selecting the right environments is a challenging problem, given that these are rarely known a priori. We propose Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED), a unified framework that learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments, and optimizes any robust objective averaged over this learned distribution. UAED yields adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL without predefined groups or manual environment design. We provide a theoretical analysis by providing PAC-Bayes bounds and by showing robustness to test environment distributions under standard conditions. Empirically, UAED discovers interpretable environment distributions and improves worst-case accuracy on standard benchmarks, while remaining competitive on mean accuracy. Our results indicate that making environments adaptive is a practical route to out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

<title>Same model, better performance: the impact of shuffling on DNA Language Models benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly popular in genomics due to their potential to decode complex biological sequences. Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.

<title>Adapting Noise to Data: Generative Flows from 1D Processes</title>

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Contraction and entropy production in continuous-time Sinkhorn dynamics</title>

Abstract: Recently, the vanishing-step-size limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm at finite regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ was shown to be a mirror descent in the space of probability measures. We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow. We define the Dirichlet form associated to its (nonlocal) infinitesimal generator, prove a Poincar\'e inequality for it, and show that the spectral gap is strictly positive along the Sinkhorn flow whenever $\varepsilon > 0$. Lastly, we show that the entropy decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) holds. We give for illustration two immediate practical use-cases for the Sinkhorn LSI: as a design principle for the latent space in which generative models are trained, and as a stopping heuristic for discrete-time algorithms.

<title>EReLiFM: Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning for Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels</title>

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals, enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/ERELIFM.

<title>Who is a Better Matchmaker? Human vs. Algorithmic Judge Assignment in a High-Stakes Startup Competition</title>

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges. Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000 to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE), and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on $309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated $3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency, underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in machine learning has been the rigid separation between data work and model refinement, enforced by slow fine-tuning cycles. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier, allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically and specify ambiguous policies more concretely. This work points toward more robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development aligned with local preferences and policies.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions, we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance, requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

<title>Dendrograms of Mixing Measures for Softmax-Gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts: Consistency without Model Sweeps</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12744</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture of experts (SGMoE) that addresses three long-standing obstacles in parameter estimation and model selection: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters up to common translations, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions that induce coupled differential relations in the likelihood, and (iii) the tight numerator-denominator coupling in the softmax-induced conditional density. Our approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model misspecification (e.g., $\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps, outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training. Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Abstract: We present a new computational near-eye display method that addresses the vergence-accommodation conflict problem in stereoscopic displays through accommodation-invariance. Our system integrates a refractive lens eyepiece with a novel wavefront coding diffractive optical element, operating in tandem with a pre-processing convolutional neural network. We employ end-to-end learning to jointly optimize the wavefront-coding optics and the image pre-processing module. To implement this approach, we develop a differentiable retinal image formation model that accounts for limiting aperture and chromatic aberrations introduced by the eye optics. We further integrate the neural transfer function and the contrast sensitivity function into the loss model to account for related perceptual effects. To tackle off-axis distortions, we incorporate position dependency into the pre-processing module. In addition to conducting rigorous analysis based on simulations, we also fabricate the designed diffractive optical element and build a benchtop setup, demonstrating accommodation-invariance for depth ranges of up to four diopters.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text. This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI), which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.

Abstract: We develop an extension of posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) that is suited for a continuing agent-environment interface and integrates naturally into agent designs that scale to complex environments. The approach, continuing PSRL, maintains a statistically plausible model of the environment and follows a policy that maximizes expected $\gamma$-discounted return in that model. At each time, with probability $1-\gamma$, the model is replaced by a sample from the posterior distribution over environments. For a choice of discount factor that suitably depends on the horizon $T$, we establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S \sqrt{A T})$ bound on the Bayesian regret, where $S$ is the number of environment states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\tau$ denotes the reward averaging time, which is a bound on the duration required to accurately estimate the average reward of any policy. Our work is the first to formalize and rigorously analyze the resampling approach with randomized exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an efficient approach for large-scale distributed machine learning that promises data privacy by keeping training data on client devices. However, recent research has uncovered vulnerabilities in FL, impacting both security and privacy through poisoning attacks and the potential disclosure of sensitive information in individual model updates as well as the aggregated global model. This paper explores the inadequacies of existing FL protection measures when applied independently, and the challenges of creating effective compositions.
  Addressing these issues, we propose WW-FL, an innovative framework that combines secure multi-party computation (MPC) with hierarchical FL to guarantee data and global model privacy. One notable feature of WW-FL is its capability to prevent malicious clients from directly poisoning model parameters, confining them to less destructive data poisoning attacks. We furthermore provide a PyTorch-based FL implementation integrated with Meta's CrypTen MPC framework to systematically measure the performance and robustness of WW-FL. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that WW-FL is a promising solution for secure and private large-scale federated learning.

Abstract: Algorithms that balance the stability-plasticity trade-off are well studied in the Continual Learning literature. However, only a few focus on obtaining models for specified trade-off preferences. When solving the problem of continual learning under specific trade-offs (CLuST), state-of-the-art techniques leverage rehearsal-based learning, which requires retraining when a model corresponding to a new trade-off preference is requested. This is inefficient, since there potentially exists a significant number of different trade-offs, and a large number of models may be requested. As a response, we propose Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL), an algorithm that tackles CLuST efficiently. IBCL replaces retraining with a constant-time convex combination. Given a new task, IBCL (1) updates the knowledge base as a convex hull of model parameter distributions, and (2) generates one Pareto-optimal model per given trade-off via convex combination without additional training. That is, obtaining models corresponding to specified trade-offs via IBCL is zero-shot. Experiments whose baselines are current CLuST algorithms show that IBCL improves classification by at most 44% on average per task accuracy, and by 45% on peak per task accuracy while maintaining a near-zero to positive backward transfer, with memory overheads converging to constants. In addition, its training overhead, measured by the number of batch updates, remains constant at every task, regardless of the number of preferences requested. IBCL also improves multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks by maintaining the same Pareto front hypervolume, while significantly reducing the training cost. Details can be found at: https://github.com/ibcl-anon/ibcl.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables clients (e.g., hospitals and banks) to jointly train machine learning models without a central orchestration server. In each global training round, each client trains a local model on its own training data and then they exchange local models for aggregation. In this work, we propose SelfishAttack, a new family of attacks to DFL. In SelfishAttack, a set of selfish clients aim to achieve competitive advantages over the remaining non-selfish ones, i.e., the final learnt local models of the selfish clients are more accurate than those of the non-selfish ones. Towards this goal, the selfish clients send carefully crafted local models to each remaining non-selfish one in each global training round. We formulate finding such local models as an optimization problem and propose methods to solve it when DFL uses different aggregation rules. Theoretically, we show that our methods find the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. Empirically, we show that SelfishAttack successfully increases the accuracy gap (i.e., competitive advantage) between the final learnt local models of selfish clients and those of non-selfish ones. Moreover, SelfishAttack achieves larger accuracy gaps than poisoning attacks when extended to increase competitive advantages.

Abstract: *Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.

Abstract: Training LLMs relies on distributed implementations using multiple GPUs to compute gradients in parallel with sharded optimizers. However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (ACCO), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, ACCO reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective approach to enhance the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external databases, which are typically composed of diverse sources, to supplement the limited internal knowledge of LLMs. However, the standard RAG often risks retrieving incorrect information, as it relies solely on relevance between a query and a document, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of these sources. To address this issue, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG), a new multi-source RAG framework that estimates the reliability of sources and leverages this information to prioritize highly reliable and relevant documents, ensuring more robust and accurate response generation. Specifically, RA-RAG first estimates source reliability by cross-checking information across multiple sources. It then retrieves documents from the top-$\kappa$ reliable and relevant sources and aggregates their information using weighted majority voting (WMV), where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. Comprehensive experiments show that RA-RAG consistently outperforms baselines in scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability while scaling efficiently as the number of sources increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of RA-RAG to estimate real-world sources' reliability, highlighting its practical applicability. \jy{Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/ml-postech/RA-RAG}{RA-RAG}.}

<title>COMAL: A Convergent Meta-Algorithm for Aligning LLMs with General Preferences</title>

Abstract: Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always sufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human preferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.

Abstract: The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced the understanding of statistical learning, particularly for majority voting methods. Despite its successes, its application to multi-view learning -- a setting with multiple complementary data representations -- remains underexplored. In this work, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to multi-view learning, introducing novel generalization bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds provide an alternative to traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence-based counterparts, leveraging the flexibility of R\'enyi divergence. Furthermore, we propose first- and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds and extend the C-bound to multi-view settings. To bridge theory and practice, we design efficient self-bounding optimization algorithms that align with our theoretical results.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.

<title>AlphaZero Neural Scaling and Zipf's Law: a Tale of Board Games and Power Laws</title>

Abstract: Neural scaling laws are observed in a range of domains, to date with no universal understanding of why they occur. Recent theories suggest that loss power laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using a model of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with the quanta scaling model, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these less-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game states.

Abstract: Dimension reduction (DR) algorithms have proven to be extremely useful for gaining insight into large-scale high-dimensional datasets, particularly finding clusters in transcriptomic data. The initial phase of these DR methods often involves converting the original high-dimensional data into a graph. In this graph, each edge represents the similarity or dissimilarity between pairs of data points. However, this graph is frequently suboptimal due to unreliable high-dimensional distances and the limited information extracted from the high-dimensional data. This problem is exacerbated as the dataset size increases. If we reduce the size of the dataset by selecting points for a specific sections of the embeddings, the clusters observed through DR are more separable since the extracted subgraphs are more reliable. In this paper, we introduce LocalMAP, a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that dynamically and locally adjusts the graph to address this challenge. By dynamically extracting subgraphs and updating the graph on-the-fly, LocalMAP is capable of identifying and separating real clusters within the data that other DR methods may overlook or combine. We demonstrate the benefits of LocalMAP through a case study on biological datasets, highlighting its utility in helping users more accurately identify clusters for real-world problems.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.

Abstract: It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence of a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method. SSME also improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test distribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the performance of language models.

Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their generation. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: existing RAG poisoning attacks are less effective under GraphRAG than conventional RAG, due to GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GragPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GragPoison employs three key strategies: (i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, (ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and (iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GragPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text) on multiple variations of GraphRAG. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Learning the solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary domains is challenging due to the diversity of possible domain shapes, in addition to the often intricate underlying physics. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time. Our code is publicly available at github.com/camlab-ethz/rigno.

Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in robotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to offline universal perturbation attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP), and Vector-Quantizied Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these methods to universal adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal that most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We also show that these attacks are often transferable across algorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a systematic study of the vulnerabilities of different LfD algorithms to both white-box and black-box attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of modern BC algorithms, paving the way for future work in addressing such limitations.

Abstract: Regularization is a core component of recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Mirror Descent Value Iteration (MDVI) uses both Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy as regularizers in its value and policy updates. Despite its empirical success in discrete action domains and strong theoretical guarantees, the performance of KL-entroy-regularized methods do not surpass a strong entropy-only-regularized method in continuous action domains. In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore effective choices for the bounding functions, and show that MDAC performs better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding functions.

Abstract: We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.

Abstract: Many data clustering applications must handle objects that cannot be represented as vectors. In this context, the bag-of-vectors representation describes complex objects through discrete distributions, for which the Wasserstein distance provides a well-conditioned dissimilarity measure. Kernel methods extend this by embedding distance information into feature spaces that facilitate analysis. However, an unsupervised framework that combines kernels with Wasserstein distances for clustering distributional data is still lacking. We address this gap by introducing a computationally tractable framework that integrates Wasserstein metrics with kernel methods for clustering. The framework can accommodate both vectorial and distributional data, enabling applications in various domains. It comprises three components: (i) an efficient approximation of pairwise Wasserstein distances using multiple reference distributions; (ii) shifted positive definite kernel functions based on Wasserstein distances, combined with kernel principal component analysis for feature mapping; and (iii) scalable, distance-agnostic validity indices for clustering evaluation and kernel parameter optimization. Experiments on power distribution graphs and real-world time series demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent

Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are particularly suitable for handling phase-sensitive signals, including electrocardiography (ECG), radar/sonar, and wireless in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) streams. Nevertheless, their \emph{interpretability} and \emph{probability calibration} remain insufficiently investigated. In this work, we present a Newton--Puiseux framework that examines the \emph{local decision geometry} of a trained CVNN by (i) fitting a small, kink-aware polynomial surrogate to the \emph{logit difference} in the vicinity of uncertain inputs, and (ii) factorizing this surrogate using Newton--Puiseux expansions to derive analytic branch descriptors, including exponents, multiplicities, and orientations. These descriptors provide phase-aligned directions that induce class flips in the original network and allow for a straightforward, \emph{multiplicity-guided} temperature adjustment for improved calibration. We outline assumptions and diagnostic measures under which the surrogate proves informative and characterize potential failure modes arising from piecewise-holomorphic activations (e.g., modReLU). Our phase-aware analysis identifies sensitive directions and enhances Expected Calibration Error in two case studies beyond a controlled $\C^2$ synthetic benchmark -- namely, the MIT--BIH arrhythmia (ECG) dataset and RadioML 2016.10a (wireless modulation) -- when compared to uncalibrated softmax and standard post-hoc baselines. We also present confidence intervals, non-parametric tests, and quantify sensitivity to inaccuracies in estimating branch multiplicity. Crucially, this method requires no modifications to the architecture and applies to any CVNN with complex logits transformed to real moduli.

Abstract: Deterministic Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) enforce by construction a regularization on the latent space by applying a truncated SVD. While this regularization makes Autoencoders more powerful, using them for generative purposes is counter-intuitive due to their deterministic nature. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well known for their generative abilities by learning a probabilistic latent space. In this paper, we present Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs), a model that leverages the advantages of both RRAEs and VAEs. Our claims and results show that when carefully sampling the latent space of RRAEs and further regularizing with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (similarly to VAEs), VRRAEs outperform RRAEs and VAEs. Additionally, we show that the regularization induced by the SVD not only makes VRRAEs better generators than VAEs, but also reduces the possibility of posterior collapse. Our results include a synthetic dataset of a small size that showcases the robustness of VRRAEs against collapse, and three real-world datasets; the MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, over which VRRAEs are shown to outperform both VAEs and RRAEs on many random generation and interpolation tasks based on the FID score. We developed an open-source implementation of VRRAEs in JAX (Equinox), available at https://github.com/JadM133/RRAEs.git.

Fixed point explanations satisfy properties like minimality, stability, and faithfulness, revealing hidden model behaviours and explanatory weaknesses. We define convergence conditions for several classes of explainers, from feature-based to mechanistic tools like Sparse AutoEncoders, and we report quantitative and qualitative results for several datasets and models, including LLMs such as Llama-3.3-70B.

<title>Joint Embedding vs Reconstruction: Provable Benefits of Latent Space Prediction for Self Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.

Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear Dynamics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen chaotic systems preserving both short-term accuracy and long-term statistics. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We also demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on increasingly complex tasks, understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities has become essential. However, existing evaluations focus on distinct and isolated tasks. We propose a unified diagnostic lens: structural reasoning--understanding and manipulating relationships like order, hierarchy, and connectivity. We introduce DSR-Bench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM structural reasoning through canonical data structures, which serve as interpretable, algorithmically meaningful abstractions. DSR-Bench spans 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 synthetically generated problem instances with minimal contamination. The benchmark's hierarchical design pinpoints specific failure modes, while its fully automated evaluation ensures objective and consistent assessment. Benchmarking ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model scores only 0.498 out of 1 on challenging instances. Three additional evaluation suites reveal further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and natural language scenarios, and fail to reason over their own generated code. DSR-Bench offers a principled diagnostic tool for structural reasoning, helping expose reasoning bottlenecks and guide the development of more capable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to existing approaches.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

<title>Learning to Explore in Diverse Reward Settings via Temporal-Difference-Error Maximization</title>

Abstract: Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.

<title>Leveraging Predictive Equivalence in Decision Trees</title>

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a \textbf{Token Importance Recurrence} phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose \textbf{LazyEviction}, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50\%\textasciitilde70\% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Halo-949/LazyEviction.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on an encoder to estimate densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing numerically brittle objectives, potentially harming model training and quality. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder, a unifying approach for finding manifold-valued latents on any Riemannian manifold. Latents are learned with a Riemannian optimizer while jointly training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: The {\em stop gradient} and {\em exponential moving average} iterative procedures are commonly used in non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream applications in practice. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We show that, in general, although they {\em do not} optimize the original objective, or {\em any} other smooth function, they {\em do} avoid collapse Following~\citet{Tian21}, but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average {\em always} leads to collapse. Conversely, we characterize explicitly the equilibria of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures in this linear setting as algebraic varieties in their parameter space, and show that they are, in general, {\em asymptotically stable}. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by empirical experiments with real and synthetic data.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model. While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research investigates whether Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) can outperform conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in the diagnosis of electrical and mechanical faults from vibration and acoustic data.
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as LeakyReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in induction motor condition monitoring.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate.
  In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As sixth generation (6G) wireless networks evolve, accurate signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) maps are becoming increasingly critical for effective resource management and optimization. However, acquiring such maps at high resolution is often cost-prohibitive, creating a severe data scarcity challenge. This necessitates machine learning (ML) approaches capable of robustly reconstructing the full map from extremely sparse measurements. To address this, we introduce a novel reconstruction framework based on Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs). Unlike data-hungry ML models, GENEOs are low-complexity operators that embed domain-specific geometric priors, such as translation invariance, directly into their structure. This provides a strong inductive bias, enabling effective reconstruction from very few samples. Our key insight is that for network management, preserving the topological structure of the SINR map, such as the geometry of coverage holes and interference patterns, is often more critical than minimizing pixel-wise error. We validate our approach on realistic ray-tracing-based urban scenarios, evaluating performance with both traditional statistical metrics (mean squared error (MSE)) and, crucially, a topological metric (1-Wasserstein distance). Results show that while maintaining competitive MSE, our method dramatically outperforms established ML baselines in topological fidelity. This demonstrates the practical advantage of GENEOs for creating structurally accurate SINR maps that are more reliable for downstream network optimization tasks.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (SARM), a novel architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment performance compared to conventional reward models.

Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning

<title>Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming</title>

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

<title>Context-Action Embedding Learning for Off-Policy Evaluation in Contextual Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator. Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By assuming a continuous-time linear time-invariant system with simultaneously-diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution of the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate uncertainties through the dynamics from keys to queries. A generalization of attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for filtering the trajectory of this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated query-key precisions. We further constrain the system dynamics and noise in order to obtain a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of zero decay and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover a complex-valued generalization of ordinary dot-product attention with rotary positional encodings.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records. They are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as auxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning their representations. This study explored the development of a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to demographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions from different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was explored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across task, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundation models for tabular demographic attributes offer a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

We prove a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, where the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance explicitly reflects the dependence on the number of iterations, state-action space size, the discount factor, and the quality of exploration. In addition, we derive a functional central limit theorem, showing that the partial-sum process converges weakly to a Brownian motion.

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks. Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier should adapt to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the input graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems, effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets, TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Abstract: The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs have been widely investigated on medical ultrasound images. Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification.
  In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy improvement from fixed datasets without online interactions, making it highly suitable for real-world applications lacking efficient simulators. Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.

<title>PPA-Game: Characterizing and Learning Competitive Dynamics Among Online Content Creators</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game (PPA-Game), which characterizes situations where agents compete for divisible resources. In the PPA-game, agents select from available resources, and their payoffs are proportionately determined based on heterogeneous weights attributed to them. Such dynamics simulate content creators on online recommender systems like YouTube and TikTok, who compete for finite consumer attention, with content exposure reliant on inherent and distinct quality. We first conduct a game-theoretical analysis of the PPA-Game. While the PPA-Game does not always guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), we identify prevalent scenarios ensuring its existence. Simulated experiments further prove that the cases where PNE does not exist rarely happen. Beyond analyzing static payoffs, we further discuss the agents' online learning about resource payoffs by integrating a multi-player multi-armed bandit framework. We propose an online algorithm facilitating each agent's maximization of cumulative payoffs over $T$ rounds. Theoretically, we establish that the regret of any agent is bounded by $O(\log^{1 + \eta} T)$ for any $\eta > 0$. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our online learning approach.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing exact goodness-of-fit tests for discrete exponential family models. This classical problem remains practically unsolved for many types of structured or sparse data, as it rests on a computationally difficult core task: to produce a reliable sample from lattice points in a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach for learning `good moves' for sampling. We illustrate the approach on data sets and models for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size, sparsity structure, and the requirement to use prohibitive non-linear algebra computations in the process. The differentiating factor is the use of scalable tools from \emph{linear} algebra in the context of theoretical guarantees provided by \emph{non-linear} algebra. Our algorithm is based on an actor-critic sampling scheme, with provable convergence.
  The discovered moves can be used to efficiently obtain an exchangeable sample, significantly cutting computational times with regards to statistical testing.

Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.

<title>Cross-Modal Safety Alignment: Is textual unlearning all you need?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02575</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2406.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that integrating new modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creates a new attack surface that bypasses existing safety training techniques like Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.

Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising paradigm that may overcome the current computational power bottlenecks. The increasing maturity of quantum processors provides more possibilities for the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. As the crucial stages for quantum algorithm implementation, the logic circuit design and quantum compiling have also received significant attention, which covers key technologies, e.g., quantum logic circuit synthesis (also widely known as quantum architecture search) and optimization, as well as qubit mapping and routing. Recent studies suggest that the scale and precision of related algorithms are steadily increasing, especially with the integration of artificial intelligence methods. In this survey, we systematically review and summarize a vast body of literature, exploring the feasibility of an integrated design and optimization scheme that spans from the algorithmic level to quantum hardware, combining the steps of logic circuit design and compilation optimization. Leveraging the exceptional cognitive and learning capabilities of AI algorithms, it becomes more possible to reduce manual design costs, enhance the precision and efficiency of execution, and facilitate the implementation and validation of the superiority of quantum algorithms on hardware.

<title>Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids</title>

Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in topological data analysis. An initial step in its use involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with \v{C}ech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial complex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present an algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that the ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small perturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes in the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee analogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and \v{C}ech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating the homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological features are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.

<title>LLMBridge: Reducing Costs in a Prompt-Centric Internet</title>

Abstract: Today's Internet infrastructure is centered around content retrieval over HTTP, with middleboxes (e.g., HTTP proxies) playing a crucial role in performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. We envision a future where Internet communication will be dominated by "prompts" sent to generative AI models. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP proxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique challenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step toward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM proxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions and education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key optimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model), context management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic caching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These optimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications navigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we deploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&amp;A service and a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for over twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests. In parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science courses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications - such as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests per day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the collected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization strategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced natural language processing, driving significant breakthroughs in tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and domain-specific reasoning. The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.

arXiv:2501.10486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.

Abstract: In this work, we address the brand entity linking problem for e-commerce search queries. The entity linking task is done by either i)a two-stage process consisting of entity mention detection followed by entity disambiguation or ii) an end-to-end linking approaches that directly fetch the target entity given the input text. The task presents unique challenges: queries are extremely short (averaging 2.4 words), lack natural language structure, and must handle a massive space of unique brands. We present a two-stage approach combining named-entity recognition with matching, and a novel end-to-end solution using extreme multi-class classification. We validate our solutions by both offline benchmarks and the impact of online A/B test.

Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.

Abstract: Contrastive learning -- a modern approach to extract useful representations from unlabeled data by training models to distinguish similar samples from dissimilar ones -- has driven significant progress in foundation models. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing data augmentation-based contrastive learning, with a focus on SimCLR as a representative example. Our approach is based on the concept of \emph{approximate sufficient statistics}, which we extend beyond its original definition in \cite{oko2025statistical} for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using KL-divergence. We generalize it to equivalent forms and general f-divergences, and show that minimizing SimCLR and other contrastive losses yields encoders that are approximately sufficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these near-sufficient encoders can be effectively adapted to downstream regression and classification tasks, with performance depending on their sufficiency and the error induced by data augmentation in contrastive learning. Concrete examples in linear regression and topic classification are provided to illustrate the broad applicability of our results.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant steps in simulating agent-based human crowds, yet most efforts remain focused on low-level tasks such as collision avoidance, path following, and flocking. Realistic simulations, however, require modeling high-level behaviors that emerge from agents interacting with each other and with their environment over time. We introduce Generative Crowds (Gen-C), a generative framework that produces crowd scenarios capturing agent-agent and agent-environment interactions, shaping coherent high-level crowd plans. To avoid the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating real crowd video data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to bootstrap synthetic datasets of crowd scenarios. We propose a time-expanded graph representation, encoding actions, interactions, and spatial context. Gen-C employs a dual Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) architecture that jointly learns connectivity patterns and node features conditioned on textual and structural signals, overcoming the limitations of direct LLM generation to enable scalable, environment-aware multi-agent crowd simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gen-C on scenarios with diverse behaviors such as a University Campus and a Train Station, showing that it generates heterogeneous crowds, coherent interactions, and high-level decision-making patterns consistent with real-world crowd dynamics.

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The code is available at: https://github.com/TSommariva/HTTY_NeuMeta.

arXiv:2505.15696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we study lightweight extensions to BERT that refine the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach, called MaxPoolBERT, enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring new pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance than the standard BERT base model on low resource tasks of the GLUE benchmark.

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: Large language models have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting predefined stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle when stylistic requirements are implicitly represented by a set of examples, such as texts produced by a specific human translator. In this work, we explore various strategies for personalizing automatically generated translations when few examples are available, with a focus on the challenging domain of literary translation. We begin by determining the feasibility of the task and how style information is encoded within model representations. Then, we evaluate various prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, with a particular focus on contrastive steering with sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to identify salient personalization properties. We demonstrate that contrastive SAE steering yields robust style conditioning and translation quality, resulting in higher inference-time computational efficiency than prompting approaches. We further examine the impact of steering on model activations, finding that layers encoding personalization properties are impacted similarly by prompting and SAE steering, suggesting a similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data. This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.

arXiv:2507.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

<title>Physics-Based Machine Learning Closures and Wall Models for Hypersonic Transition-Continuum Boundary Layer Predictions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08986</link>

arXiv:2507.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling rarefied hypersonic flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the breakdown of classical continuum assumptions in the transition-continuum regime, where the Knudsen number ranges from approximately 0.1 to 10. Conventional Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) models with empirical slip-wall boundary conditions fail to accurately predict nonequilibrium effects such as velocity slip, temperature jump, and shock structure deviations. We develop a physics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models and boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in nonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs) for the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained via adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional supersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers. Additionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian approximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model replaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven boundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our results show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the skewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly improved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes. Strategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and inclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model generalization. Increasing model complexity yields diminishing returns for out-of-sample cases, underscoring the need to balance degrees of freedom and overfitting. This work establishes data-driven, physics-consistent strategies for improving hypersonic flow modeling for regimes in which conventional continuum approaches are invalid.

<title>Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Not Local</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.

<title>CAMERA: Multi-Matrix Joint Compression for MoE Models via Micro-Expert Redundancy Analysis</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power numerous AI applications, yet updating their knowledge remains costly. Model editing provides a lightweight alternative through targeted parameter modifications, with meta-learning-based model editing (MLME) demonstrating strong effectiveness and efficiency. However, we find that MLME struggles in low-data regimes and incurs high training costs due to the use of KL divergence. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{Edit (EMSEdit)}$, which leverages multi-step backpropagation (MSBP) to effectively capture gradient-activation mapping patterns within editing samples, performs multi-step edits per sample to enhance editing performance under limited data, and introduces norm-based regularization to preserve unedited knowledge while improving training efficiency. Experiments on two datasets and three LLMs show that EMSEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sequential and batch editing. Moreover, MSBP can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches to yield additional performance gains. Further experiments on a multi-hop reasoning editing task demonstrate EMSEdit's robustness in handling complex edits, while ablation studies validate the contribution of each design component. Our code is available at https://github.com/xpq-tech/emsedit.

Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.

arXiv:2508.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

arXiv:2509.14032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and computation of Nash equilibria in continuous static games where the players' admissible strategies are subject to shared coupling constraints, i.e., constraints that depend on their \emph{joint} strategies. Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by playerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results on the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they rely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By leveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into the contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we give an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having established existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via independent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities admit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible region, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive stepsizes. Starting from an initial feasible strategy profile and under exact gradient feedback, the proposed method converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate constrained Nash equilibrium within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations.

Abstract: There are inefficiencies in financial markets, with unexploited patterns in price, volume, and cross-sectional relationships. While many approaches use large-scale transformers, we take a domain-focused path: feed-forward and recurrent networks with curated features to capture subtle regularities in noisy financial data. This smaller-footprint design is computationally lean and reliable under low signal-to-noise, crucial for daily production at scale. At Increase Alpha, we built a deep-learning framework that maps over 800 U.S. equities into daily directional signals with minimal computational overhead.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we outline the general overview of the predictive model without disclosing its core underlying concepts. Second, we evaluate its real-time performance through transparent, industry standard metrics. Forecast accuracy is benchmarked against both naive baselines and macro indicators. The performance outcomes are summarized via cumulative returns, annualized Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The best portfolio combination using our signals provides a low-risk, continuous stream of returns with a Sharpe ratio of more than 2.5, maximum drawdown of around 3%, and a near-zero correlation with the S&amp;P 500 market benchmark. We also compare the model's performance through different market regimes, such as the recent volatile movements of the US equity market in the beginning of 2025. Our analysis showcases the robustness of the model and significantly stable performance during these volatile periods.
  Collectively, these findings show that market inefficiencies can be systematically harvested with modest computational overhead if the right variables are considered. This report will emphasize the potential of traditional deep learning frameworks for generating an AI-driven edge in the financial market.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

arXiv:2509.17238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.

<title>Evaluating the Impact of Radiographic Noise on Chest X-ray Semantic Segmentation and Disease Classification Using a Scalable Noise Injection Framework</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum (Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel, scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843), signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform. We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

Abstract: In this paper, for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unbounded state spaces we present refined upper bounds presented in [Kara et. al. JMLR'23] on finite model approximation errors via optimizing the quantizers used for finite model approximations. We also consider implications on quantizer design for quantized Q-learning and empirical model learning, and the performance of policies obtained via Q-learning where the quantized state is treated as the state itself. We highlight the distinctions between planning, where approximating MDPs can be independently designed, and learning (either via Q-learning or empirical model learning), where approximating MDPs are restricted to be defined by invariant measures of Markov chains under exploration policies, leading to significant subtleties on quantizer design performance, even though asymptotic near optimality can be established under both setups. In particular, under Lyapunov growth conditions, we obtain explicit upper bounds which decay to zero as the number of bins approaches infinity

<title>Scale-Invariant Regret Matching and Online Learning with Optimal Convergence: Bridging Theory and Practice in Zero-Sum Games</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04407</link>

arXiv:2510.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A considerable chasm has been looming for decades between theory and practice in zero-sum game solving through first-order methods. Although a convergence rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can exhibit slower $\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play.
  In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ (i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive* learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\ell_2$-)norm of the regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate -- can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.
  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.

Abstract: Sparse Ternary General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) remains under-optimized in existing libraries for Apple Silicon CPUs. We present a Sparse Ternary GEMM kernel optimized specifically for Apple's M-series processors. We propose a set of architecture-aware optimizations, including a novel blocked and interleaved sparse data format to improve memory locality, strategies to increase Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP), and NEON-based Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization to exploit data-level parallelism. Our scalar implementation achieves up to a 5.98x performance increase over a traditional Ternary Compressed Sparse Column (TCSC) baseline for large matrices with 50% ternary nonzero values (sparsity), reaching up to a 50.2% of the processor's theoretical peak performance, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels. Our vectorized implementation delivers up to a 5.59x performance increase for large matrices with 25% sparsity, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels.

Abstract: Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples to transform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with a target coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strong performance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require to use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used for training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the use of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional labels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for split conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification tasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using unsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples previously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental results show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to that with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in performance guarantees and computational efficiency.

arXiv:2510.08558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks, including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function usually matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

<div> Generative Modeling, Equilibrium Matching, Energy Landscape, Optimization-based Sampling, Image Generation <br />
Summary:
Equilibrium Matching (EqM) is a novel generative modeling framework that focuses on learning the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, removing the non-equilibrium dynamics present in traditional diffusion and flow-based models. By optimizing sampling through gradient descent on the learned landscape, EqM achieves superior generation performance, demonstrated by an impressive FID score on ImageNet 256x256. This framework is not only empirically effective but also theoretically sound in learning and sampling from the data manifold. EqM offers versatility by excelling in tasks like image denoising, out-of-distribution detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with an equilibrium landscape, EqM provides a seamless integration between flow-based and energy-based models, facilitating optimization-driven inference processes. <br />
 <div>

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Summary: 
This study explores the possibility of non-gradient "curl" components in biological neural network learning dynamics. The presence of inhibitory-excitatory connections or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity can introduce curl terms that do not align with traditional gradient descent. Analyzing feedforward networks within a student-teacher framework, the study shows that small curl terms can mimic gradient descent dynamics, while strong curl terms can destabilize learning. Depending on the network architecture, curl terms can either enhance or hinder learning speed compared to gradient descent. Some architectures can accommodate diverse learning rules for robust learning, challenging normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks. The findings shed light on the potential complexity of learning dynamics in biological neural networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity, resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS

Summary:
Transformer-based methods have shown impressive results in time series forecasting, but they still struggle with overemphasizing temporal dependencies, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. This study identifies the importance of the embedding method used in learning effective representations for Transformer performance. To address this, the authors propose Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME), which enhance sequence representations through multidimensional embeddings capturing richer information. The HTME extractor combines temporal and multivariate feature extraction modules to strike a balance between model complexity and performance efficiency.

This approach provides a lightweight forecasting solution by leveraging enhanced feature extraction capabilities to improve sequence understanding and forecasting accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations. These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Summary: Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) addresses the issue of entropy collapse in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by using REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions. This method stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, preventing premature convergence and preserving exploration. The study reveals a non-monotonic relationship between performance and entropy, showing that increasing entropy can initially improve performance before eventually leading to a decline. AEPO introduces three key designs to control entropy effectively: policy gradient regularization, distribution regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization. This approach extends beyond entropy control, offering a broader framework for reinforcement fine-tuning where superior target distributions can serve as effective regularizers. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.

Summary:
This paper presents a writer identification system using an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a focus on utilizing image fragments extracted from word images through a pyramid-based strategy. The system aims to capture fine-grained details and coarse features at various levels of abstraction to improve representation learning. By training the network on these fragments, the system enhances robustness compared to traditional CNNs trained on full word images. Additionally, an attention mechanism is integrated to further enhance feature representation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, showcasing its effectiveness in writer identification tasks, particularly in cases with limited handwriting data access. <div>

Abstract: Writer identification due to its widespread application in various fields has gained popularity over the years. In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement.
  In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.

Summary: 
The study introduces Dyna-Think, a thinking framework combining planning, internal world modeling, reasoning, and acting to enhance AI agent performance. They propose two methods, Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT), to train the agents. DIT reconstructs the thinking process of the AI model and focuses on relevant world model simulation for planned actions. DDT uses a two-stage training process to improve the agent's world modeling and action performances. Results from experiments on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena show that Dyna-Think improves both in-domain and out-of-domain performance of AI agents, achieving similar performance to baseline models with fewer tokens. The study also highlights the effectiveness of critique generation for world model training and the correlation between agent performance and world modeling abilities, suggesting a promising research direction for enhancing AI agents' reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

<div> Efficiency, Hybrid Attention, Transformers, Recall Accuracy, Context Modeling
Summary:
Native Hybrid Attention (NHA) is introduced as a hybrid architecture combining linear and full attention to address the efficiency and recall accuracy trade-off in Transformers. NHA integrates intra and inter-layer hybridization, maintaining long-term context with linear RNN and short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single softmax attention operation is applied over all keys and values to enable context-dependent weighting without additional fusion parameters. The sliding window size parameter controls the inter-layer behavior, allowing smooth adjustment between linear and full attention while maintaining structural uniformity across layers. Experimental results demonstrate NHA's superior performance in recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks compared to other hybrid models. Additionally, NHA can be used to hybridize pretrained language models, achieving competitive accuracy with efficiency gains. <div>

Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single \texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values, enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks. Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

<div> embodiment, existentialism, Heidegger, Nietzsche, reinforcement learning

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of physical embodiment in artificial agents and how understanding existentialist concepts can help develop more robust and caring agents. Inspired by Heidegger's philosophy, the authors define two conditions for physical embodiment: being-in-the-world and being-towards-death. These conditions give rise to a homeostatic drive to maintain integrity and an intrinsic drive to maximize control over future states. Drawing on Nietzsche's concept of will-to-power, the article explores how intrinsic drives can enhance an agent's capacity to meet its future needs. Formalized within a reinforcement learning framework, the study shows how intrinsically driven embodied agents can adapt and thrive in open-ended environments, cultivating capacities for open-endedness and care. <div>

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust, adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power, we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g., empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate the capacities for open-endedness and care.

<div> reasoning mechanisms, thinking models, base models, DeepSeek R1, training

Summary:
The study examines why thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform base models and investigates whether thinking models learn new reasoning capabilities or repurpose existing ones. A hybrid model is proposed to activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the appropriate time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, indicating that thinking models utilize already existing capabilities. An unsupervised approach is introduced to uncover human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models without manual or LLM-derived assumptions. The hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without weight updates while manipulating only 12% of tokens. The empirical setup offers a causal method to assess the effectiveness of reasoning mechanisms in base models by directly invoking them and measuring task performance. The study suggests that pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, while post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms for efficient inference-time compute utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

<div> framework, Bilevel Optimization, reward function, policy gradient, generative models, datasets

Summary:
Generative models are essential in modern machine learning, but traditional training methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation have limitations in generalization and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Recent research has shown the benefits of using Reinforcement Learning techniques, like Policy Gradient methods, but these methods require explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical settings. This work introduces a Bilevel Optimization framework that addresses this challenge by treating the reward function as the optimization variable in an outer-level problem, while using a policy gradient objective in the inner-level. Theoretical analysis in a tractable setting provides insights that apply to tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. The code for the framework is available on GitHub, showcasing its applicability for aligning generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. <div>

Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .

<div> ensemble, audio event detection, Insertion Hallucination, dataset biases, Posterior Feature Correction

Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of Insertion Hallucination in video-to-audio generation models, where the generated audio includes sounds not present in the video. Existing evaluation metrics fail to detect this issue due to dataset biases. The authors propose an evaluation framework using an ensemble of audio event detectors and introduce new metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of Insertion Hallucination. They also present Posterior Feature Correction, a method to mitigate this problem during inference without additional training. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe Insertion Hallucination, but the proposed method significantly reduces its impact without compromising audio quality or temporal synchronization. This work highlights the importance of addressing Insertion Hallucination in video-to-audio generation models for more reliable results. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.

Summary:
The article introduces the personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad) for multi-task learning in recommender systems. DRGrad effectively manages task conflicts by judging the stakes between tasks during training. It consists of routers, updaters, and a personalized gate network to leverage all valid gradients for each task and reduce conflicts.

In experiments on different datasets, DRGrad demonstrates the ability to judge and route stakes between tasks with varied correlation levels, showcasing its effectiveness in managing task conflicts and personalizing recommendations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain, and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2 dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of 0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time, responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations. For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving. Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time, balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Summary: 
GradFix introduces a novel approach to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new version without the need for full fine-tuning. By focusing on the sign structure of gradients, the method leverages a few labeled samples to align task vectors between models. This alignment ensures effective knowledge transfer without additional training, improving performance on vision and language tasks. GradFix outperforms traditional methods like naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning, offering significant gains in accuracy across various benchmarks. The proposed method guarantees first-order descent and provides a practical solution for practitioners looking to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2510.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.

Summary:<br />
The NOvA experiment detects neutrino particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab and requires matching raw hits in the detector to source particles for analysis. Previous methods have used a combination of traditional clustering and CNNs on 2D images of the detector views. A new approach presented in this study employs a point set neural network that processes sparse matrices of XZ and YZ views simultaneously, achieving a higher AUC score of 96.8% compared to 85.4% with independent processing. The proposed model uses minimal memory, less than 10% of previous methods, making it more efficient for identifying particle types in the NOvA experiment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector, the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Anisotropic Noise Operator, Spectrally Anisotropic Gaussian Diffusion, Inductive Bias, Data Modeling

Summary:
Spectrally Anisotropic Gaussian Diffusion (SAGD) introduces an anisotropic noise operator to diffusion models, allowing for the incorporation of inductive biases during training and sampling. By replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance, SAGD can emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands while maintaining a Gaussian forward process. The derived score relation for anisotropic covariances shows that the learned score converges to the true data score under full support, reshaping the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirical results demonstrate that the induced anisotropy in SAGD outperforms standard diffusion models on various vision datasets. Additionally, SAGD enables selective omission, allowing for learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific frequency bands. This research highlights the importance of incorporating carefully designed anisotropic forward noise to tailor inductive bias in Diffusion Probabilistic Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, for modeling electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data using an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The performance of these new loss functions was evaluated against existing ones using a large dataset of generated EIS data. The X2 loss function was found to achieve the highest performance in terms of quality of fit metrics. However, the log-B loss function offered slightly lower quality of fit but was approximately 1.4 times faster and produced lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for most circuit components. This makes log-B a strong alternative for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets. The choice of loss function was shown to impact convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE, highlighting the importance of selecting the most suitable loss function based on the specific goals of the EIS data analysis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

<div> semantic cohesive knowledge distillation, deep cross-modal hashing, multimodal data, semantic information, modality gap <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach called Semantic Cohesive Knowledge Distillation (SODA) for deep cross-modal hashing. The current methods face limitations in explicitly interacting with raw multimodal data during multi-label semantic extraction, resulting in a performance hindrance in bridging the modality gap. SODA addresses this by incorporating multi-label information as a new textual modality and using it as ground-truth label prompts to depict semantic similarities between image and text modalities. A cross-modal teacher network is introduced to distill semantic characteristics between modalities, guiding the learning process of the cross-modal student network to create a well-mapped Hamming space for images. This Hamming space serves as prior knowledge to preserve semantic similarities, leading to superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated in experiments on benchmark datasets. <div>
arXiv:2510.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However, they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing, dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt, depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Efficient, KV caching, LLM engines, LMCache, open-source
Summary:
LMCache is a new KV caching solution that efficiently extracts and shares KV caches generated by modern LLM engines. It transforms LLM engines into a collection of engines with KV cache as the storage and communication medium, enabling cache offloading and cross-engine cache transfer. LMCache's high performance is attributed to optimized data movement, modular KV cache connector, and a control API for flexible cache orchestration. When combined with vLLM, LMCache achieves up to 15x improvement in throughput. The open-source nature of LMCache has led to its adoption by enterprise inference systems, showcasing its potential for future KV caching solutions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries. LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component, decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers. Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community, LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems, which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions.

Summary: 
This study focuses on improving wildfire prediction using machine learning and Earth observation data in response to increasing wildfire risks due to climate change. The researchers introduce a method to quantify spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread forecasting, crucial for effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Summary:
An algorithm leveraging Normalizing Flows and Variational Autoencoder is introduced to generate synthetic populations with explicit coordinates, addressing the challenges posed by the uneven density and empty spaces of spatial data. The method effectively maps spatial coordinates to a regular latent space and learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features. Evaluation against 121 datasets demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. The approach enables the generation of geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolutions, facilitating applications such as flood response, epidemic modeling, evacuation planning, and transport analysis. The proposed algorithm emphasizes privacy preservation while ensuring both spatial accuracy and practical utility in the synthesized populations. <div>
arXiv:2510.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features, exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121 datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility, while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.

Summary:<br /> An article introduces a novel framework, coupled data and measurement space diffusion posterior sampling (C-DPS), to address limitations in solving inverse problems using diffusion models. C-DPS eliminates the need for heuristic updates and likelihood approximation. It incorporates a stochastic process in the measurement space along with data-space diffusion to derive a closed-form posterior distribution. This allows for accurate and recursive sampling. Empirical results show that C-DPS outperforms existing methods across various inverse problem benchmarks in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures. <div>
arXiv:2510.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Summary: 
The article discusses the use of LLM-powered AI tools to enhance causal estimation through double machine learning. It highlights the importance of accurate estimators in determining the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of high-dimensional confounders. The study suggests that leveraging predictions from generative models trained on historical data can improve the performance of estimators compared to traditional methods that rely only on adjustments. By incorporating LLM-generated guesses as predictors, the efficiency of estimation can be enhanced, particularly in overcoming curse-of-dimensionality challenges in causal inference problems. The research demonstrates this concept using a dataset of online jewelry auctions, showcasing the benefits of including generative model insights in improving estimation accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve efficiency in estimation.

Summary:
This study examines the plasticity of neural networks and how critical learning periods can be avoided through adjustments to learning hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon occurs when training starts with deficit data, leading to decreased plasticity over time. Even with additional clean data training, models struggle to achieve accuracy parity with models trained from scratch. The researchers replicated key findings from previous work and expanded the experimental scope. They also explored warm-starting as a form of deficit pretraining and showed that cyclic learning rate schedules can prevent these issues. This study not only impacts neural network training practices but also highlights the connection between critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network training.

Summary: <br />
Federated learning involves model training across multiple clients while ensuring data privacy. Differential Privacy (DP) is used to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, but fixed privacy budgets can lead to excessive noise and performance compromise. This study implements DP methods with adaptive privacy budgets using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms in the SelecEval simulator. An adaptive clipping approach is introduced in the Gaussian mechanism to dynamically update model gradients. Experiments with various privacy budgets, datasets, and client sizes show that adaptive privacy budgets and clipping can maintain model accuracy while preserving privacy over 200 training rounds. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget. However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem, adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy while preserving privacy.

arXiv:2510.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning, network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case, indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

<div> streaming risk detection, large models, real-time, guardrails, Kelp <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Kelp, a framework for streaming risk detection in large models. It addresses the potential risks of harmful or biased content generated by such models by incorporating a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head for real-time risk detection. Kelp uses intermediate model hidden states to monitor the temporal evolution of risk in generated sequences. To enhance reliable streaming moderation, an Anchored Temporal Consistency loss enforces consistent harm predictions. The study also presents StreamGuardBench, a benchmark for evaluating streaming guardrails with on-the-fly responses. Across various models and datasets, Kelp demonstrates superior performance compared to post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in probes, achieving an average F1 score 15.61% higher. Despite using only 20 million parameters and adding minimal latency per token, Kelp proves to be an effective solution for mitigating risks associated with large model content generation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications, we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides, for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called Vanishing Contributions (VCON) to smoothly transition neural models into compressed forms. Instead of directly replacing the original network with its compressed version, VCON runs both models in parallel during fine-tuning. This gradual transition process helps the network adapt over time, improving stability and reducing accuracy degradation commonly seen with compression techniques. The study evaluates VCON across various computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks with different compression strategies. Results show consistent improvements in accuracy, with some configurations even achieving a significant 20% boost. VCON proves to be a generalizable method that can enhance existing compression techniques across multiple benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2510.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory, computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON), a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies. Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
This paper discusses the challenges in time domain simulations for renewable-penetrated grids due to the need for small time steps to capture ultra-fast renewable energy dynamics. It explores using operator learning as a surrogate model for fast and scalable solutions. The concept of simulation time step-invariance is introduced, allowing models trained on coarse time steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning methods are tested on a simple system to demonstrate the feasibility of time step-invariance. The models are evaluated for zero-shot super-resolution and generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This research addresses a crucial barrier in integrating renewable energy for climate change mitigation by benchmarking operator learning methods in modeling physical systems.<br /> <div>

However, these simulations become computationally intractable for renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations. The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution, and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model physical systems.

Summary:<br />
The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for automated feature selection and bias mitigation in machine learning models. Traditional static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias caused by hidden dependencies. The new framework integrates bias mitigation and feature selection in a single learning process using a dynamic reinforcement learning agent. Unlike heuristic-driven approaches, the RL agent adaptively selects features based on a reward signal that balances predictive performance and fairness considerations. The model is designed to maintain a balance between generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the training process. The paper outlines the construction of a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agent's action space for feature subsets, and the integration with ensemble learning. This approach aims to provide a flexible and generalizable solution for selecting features in environments with correlated predictors and potential biases. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently re-emerge.

<div> Keywords: fake news detection, adversarial comments, large language models, robustness, adaptive training

Summary:
The article addresses the issue of fake news detection models being vulnerable to adversarial comments that can manipulate their decisions. The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of existing fake news detectors' susceptibility to various types of adversarial comments. They propose a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to enhance the robustness of fake news detection models. The strategy involves categorizing adversarial comments based on psychological principles, generating diverse attacks using large language models, and implementing an adaptive sampling mechanism during training. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high detection accuracy while significantly improving robustness against a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations. This approach is crucial in combatting the spread of misinformation and safeguarding public trust in online platforms.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps: (1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse, category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3) applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Summary:<br />
- Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI) is introduced as a rigorous method for identifying training data within large-scale models with strict false discovery rate (FDR) control.
- PTDI computes p-values for each data point using unseen data and constructs a conservative estimator for data usage proportion of the test set.
- The method scales these p-values and selects the final set of training data based on a data-dependent threshold.
- PTDI enables the discovery of training data with provable FDR control and boosted power.
- Extensive experiments across various models and datasets show that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate (FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate (FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Summary:
Federated clustering addresses the challenge of jointly clustering datasets from multiple interconnected devices without sharing the raw data. This paper focuses on applying the k-means principle to federated clustering, specifically formulating it as an instance of GTVMin. The proposed federated k-means algorithm allows devices to update their local cluster centroids by solving a modified local k-means problem that includes a penalty term measuring the discrepancy between neighboring devices' centroids. By sharing only aggregated information, the algorithm prioritizes privacy protection while achieving effective clustering results. The approach is designed for scenarios where maintaining data privacy is crucial, making it suitable for collaborative data analysis across distributed devices. <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, model routing, in-context vectors, scalability, query representation<br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel routing method for large language models (LLMs) that leverages the strengths of multiple models by directing queries to the most suitable model dynamically. The proposed method utilizes in-context vectors to represent model capabilities, allowing for accurate model representations and scalability without the need for retraining. The method consists of two stages: embedding and projecting queries into vectors using a projector and LLM-based router, and profiling candidate models on a query set to predict model performance based on in-context vectors. Experimental results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Additionally, the method enables seamless integration of new models into the candidate pool without requiring retraining of the router. The code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized to generate textual explanations for process models derived from event logs. In this study, an evaluation was conducted on the quality of explanations as input sizes progressively reduced. The study involved discovering models at varying input sizes, using LLMs to generate explanations, and assessing completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested improvements through a second LLM. Results on synthetic logs indicate that explanation quality remains largely consistent with moderate input reduction, highlighting a potential cost-quality trade-off. While the study is exploratory and based on LLM-generated scores rather than ground truth data, it offers insights into employing LLMs for computationally efficient process analysis in resource-constrained environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in resource-constrained settings.

<div> Keywords: Weather forecasting, spatiotemporal data analysis, multi-scale temporal dependencies, global weather systems, ARROW

Summary: 
The study introduces ARROW, a novel method for global weather forecasting that addresses key limitations of existing data-driven forecasting methods. ARROW utilizes a multi-interval forecasting model to capture spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies in global weather systems. The Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts within the model captures both shared patterns and specific characteristics across different time scales, while the Ring Positional Encoding accurately represents spatial information. To address the challenge of balancing error accumulation and fine-grained atmospheric variations, an adaptive rollout scheduler based on reinforcement learning is developed to select the most suitable time interval for forecasting based on the current weather state. Experimental results demonstrate that ARROW outperforms existing methods and establishes a promising paradigm for global weather forecasting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis, with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2) the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Summary: InterCorpRel-LLM is introduced as a framework that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze inter-firm relationships. The model, trained on a proprietary dataset from FactSet, focuses on three tasks: company graph matching, industry classification, and supply relation prediction. Results show that InterCorpRel-LLM outperforms GPT-5 in identifying supply relations and can also identify competitors with zero-shot learning. This framework provides analysts with a powerful tool to understand complex corporate networks, aiding in decision-making and risk management in dynamic markets. <div>
arXiv:2510.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs, supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5, on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs. 0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in dynamic markets.

The results showed that the Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, provided a more powerful and interpretable description of online communities compared to the machine-learning clusters. The machine-learning clusters failed to recover the Extraversion trait and lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. This affirms the robustness of the Big Five personality model and suggests that personality's semantic structure may be context-dependent. The findings indicate that while machine learning can help validate established psychological theories, it may not be able to replace them.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be able to replace them.

<div> Keywords: Active Learning, Annotation Cost, Noisy Labels, Data Distribution Shifts, Geometric Regularities<br />

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a new framework called NCAL-R for Reliable Active Learning. This framework leverages the geometric regularities of deep networks to address the unreliability of supervision in Active Learning scenarios. NCAL-R utilizes two signals - Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score and Feature Fluctuation score to prioritize informative samples that preserve class separation and highlight ambiguous regions, thus reducing the impact of noisy or redundant labels. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that NCAL-R outperforms standard Active Learning baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under label noise, and better generalization to out-of-distribution data. The incorporation of geometric reliability criteria into sample acquisition decisions makes Active Learning less susceptible to annotation errors and distribution shifts, making it more reliable for real-world labeling pipelines.<br /> 

Summary: <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty, diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts, a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines.

arXiv:2510.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA, and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives, resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering improved interpretability of learned features.

<div> Slot-aware structure encoder, heterogeneous features, slot normalization, retention-based fusion, linear time complexity

Summary: 
HeSRN is introduced as a novel approach for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. It addresses the limitations of Graph Transformers by incorporating a slot-aware structure encoder to disentangle node-type semantics and align feature distributions. The model utilizes retention-based fusion and slot normalization to mitigate semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous models. Additionally, a retention-based encoder replaces the self-attention mechanism to model dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. By employing a heterogeneous retentive encoder, HeSRN captures both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HeSRN outperforms existing heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer models in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

<div> Keywords: interatomic potentials, equivariance, scaling behavior, architecture-dependent exponents, symmetry

Summary:
This empirical study focuses on learning interatomic potentials and the importance of equivariance, especially at larger scales. The research reveals a power-law scaling behavior concerning data, parameters, and compute, with architecture-dependent exponents. Equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, exhibit superior scaling compared to non-equivariant models. Additionally, higher-order representations within equivariant architectures lead to improved scaling exponents. The analysis emphasizes the significance of aligning data and model sizes during compute-optimal training, regardless of the architecture. The results challenge the notion that models should autonomously discover fundamental inductive biases like symmetry, especially as scaling occurs, as these biases impact the task's difficulty and scaling laws. <div>
arXiv:2510.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale, because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of extracting unique characteristics from RF emitters for tasks such as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI). Traditional methods are compared to data-driven Machine Learning approaches, which offer superior performance in learning intricate RF fingerprints from raw data. A generic framework for Machine Learning-enabled RF fingerprinting is proposed, supporting various downstream tasks like SEI, EDA, and RFEC. Real RF datasets are used to demonstrate the framework's versatility in different application areas such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence, and countering drones. This approach proves beneficial for defense and civilian contexts that require efficient RF fingerprinting methods. <div>

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals. These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices, to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques. The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and countering drones.

<div> Keywords: Time series forecasting, Large Language Models, Transformer architectures, Linear Self-Attention, In-Context Learning theory

Summary: 
Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models cannot achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting. As the context length approaches infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor. Under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. Empirical validation of these findings through experiments is provided. The theoretical analysis reveals the limitations of Transformers for time series forecasting tasks, shedding light on previously unexplored phenomena and offering insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny.

<div> Keywords: Time series AI, forecasting, lightweight models, SVTime, inductive biases

Summary:
SVTime is a new lightweight model designed for long-term time series forecasting, inspired by large Vision models. It incorporates key inductive biases identified in large models for accurate forecasting, using linear layers and constraint functions. The model outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight models and competes with large models while having significantly fewer parameters. SVTime enables efficient training and inference in resource-constrained environments, addressing concerns about energy consumption and sustainability in using large models for time series analysis. This approach offers a cost-effective solution for businesses and users with limited resources, showcasing the potential for compact specialized models to achieve high performance in core tasks like forecasting. <div>
arXiv:2510.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.

Summary:
Data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap challenge existing research on pre-execution safety measures for LLM agents. To address these gaps, the authors introduce AuraGen, a controllable engine that synthesizes benign trajectories, injects risks, and filters outputs for pre-execution safety. They also propose Safiron, a guardrail model that flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales for safe planning. Additionally, they release the Pre-Exec Bench benchmark to evaluate detection, categorization, explanation, and generalization of pre-execution safety measures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Safiron over baselines on the Pre-Exec Bench, providing valuable insights for building safer agentic systems.<br /><br />Summary: Data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap in pre-execution safety measures for LLM agents are addressed through AuraGen for data generation, Safiron for guardrail modeling, and Pre-Exec Bench for evaluation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of Safiron in detecting, categorizing, and explaining risks, contributing to the development of safer agentic systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm, since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However, existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research: data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii) injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales; trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization, explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel oversampling method for addressing imbalanced classification using large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches often lead to information loss when converting categorical variables into numerical vectors. The proposed method enhances diversity by conditioning synthetic sample generation on both minority labels and features, employing a new permutation strategy for fine-tuning LLMs, and fine-tuning not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets show that the method outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines, generating realistic and diverse synthetic samples. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method encourages diversity in the generated samples through an entropy-based perspective.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity. First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach, called Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), that combines a time-lagged information bottleneck and a diffusion model for generative modeling in data-intensive molecular science. The D-SPIB protocol aims to balance representation learning and generation objectives in a flexible architecture. It also integrates temperature information from multiple molecular simulation trajectories to improve the internal representation of thermodynamics. The model is evaluated on various molecular tasks and demonstrates potential for exploring physical conditions beyond the training data set. <div>
arXiv:2510.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

<div> Fourier Neural Operator, high-resolution ocean prediction, temporal Fourier modes, physical fidelity, FNOtD<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Neural operators are increasingly being used for solving partial differential equations in weather and ocean forecasting, but challenges remain in terms of long-term prediction stability and adherence to physical laws, especially for high-frequency processes. This paper addresses these challenges in high-resolution ocean prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes. A comparison between the standard Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and the modified FNOtD, which incorporates the dispersion relation in learning ocean PDE solutions, shows that FNOtD improves long-term prediction stability and captures multiscale wave propagation, enhancing physical fidelity. This approach proves competitive with a state-of-the-art numerical ocean model while requiring less computational cost. Overall, integrating space and time in training integral kernels enables the model to effectively learn ocean dynamics and improve predictions in high-frequency settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO. It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

<br />
Summary:<br />
In this study, the relationship between decodability and causality in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting is investigated. Through activation patching techniques, the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens is examined by transferring activations between clean and corrupted image pairs. Linear probes are trained to assess the decodability of count information at different network depths. The results show a discrepancy between decodability and causality: middle-layer object tokens have strong causal influence but are weakly decodable, while final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding but are functionally inert. The CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only gains causal power in the final layers. This suggests that decodability and causality represent complementary aspects of representation, revealing hidden computational circuits within the network.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.

Summary:
The chapter introduces a unified framework for lifted training methods in deep neural networks, offering an alternative to traditional gradient-based optimization. Various strategies such as Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training are discussed within this framework. By leveraging convex optimization tools and Bregman distances, the framework enables distributed optimization, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations, and improves training landscape conditioning. Implementation includes block-coordinate descent strategies, deterministic implementations with accelerated and adaptive optimization techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods. Application to inverse problems involves training specialized networks and stable inversion of pre-trained networks. Numerical results on imaging tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the lifted Bregman approach, especially for architectures with proximal activations. <div>
arXiv:2510.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms. This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations, and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies, including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods. Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems, detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g., unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks. Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training, particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach called temporal lifting for continuous-time dynamical systems. This method utilizes a smooth monotone mapping to regularize near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving conservation laws. By employing this technique, trajectories, including those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus, become globally smooth. The temporal lifting process acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator, which can enhance stability in physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures within AI systems. This framework bridges the gap between analytic regularity theory and representation-learning methods, particularly beneficial for handling stiff or turbulent processes. <div>

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*, introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

<div> autoencoder, semantic, Decomposer Networks, interpretable components, competition

Summary: 
Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) is introduced as a semantic autoencoder that breaks down inputs into multiple easily interpretable components. Unlike traditional autoencoders which compress inputs into a single latent representation, DecompNet maintains multiple branches, each assigned a residual input that is the original signal minus the reconstructions of other branches. By implementing a differentiable network based on a Gauss-Seidel style block-coordinate descent, DecompNet facilitates explicit competition among components, resulting in concise and semantically meaningful representations. Compared to linear decomposition methods like PCA and NMF, as well as deep unrolled optimization and object-centric architectures such as MONet, IODINE, and Slot Attention, DecompNet stands out as the first semantic autoencoder to employ an all-but-one residual update rule.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Summary:
MuonMax, a new variant of the Muon optimizer, is introduced and found to be more robust than the original Muon optimizer, particularly in terms of sensitivity to learning rate choices. The combination of non-Euclidean gradient methods with model-based momentum (Momo) is explored, leading to Momo variants of Muon that outperform traditional Muon in terms of hyperparameter tuning robustness and validation scores. It is suggested that using Momo in conjunction with MuonMax can be advantageous for new tasks where optimal hyperparameters are unknown, as it may reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, the study advocates for the use of Momo with MuonMax to improve optimization efficiency and performance.

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework, we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the possibilities for improving wildfire and air quality management in the western United States by leveraging the unprecedented hourly data from NASA's TEMPO satellite mission and advances in self-supervised deep learning. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for mapping the near real-time hourly spread of wildfire fronts and smoke plumes using an innovative self-supervised deep learning-system: successfully distinguishing smoke plumes from clouds using GOES-18 and TEMPO data, strong agreement across the smoke and fire masks generated from different sensing modalities as well as significant improvement over operational products for the same cases.

<title>CALM: A Causal Analysis Language Model for Tabular Data in Complex Systems with Local Scores, Conditional Independence Tests, and Relation Attributes</title>

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However, existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data (from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies, achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the intricacies of tabular data.

<title>ProxRouter: Proximity-Weighted LLM Query Routing for Improved Robustness to Outliers</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate, yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads. Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing benchmarks.

<title>Myopic Bayesian Decision Theory for Batch Active Learning with Partial Batch Label Sampling</title>

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label. This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction (EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling (ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ADDAPT-ML/ParBaLS.

<title>TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations. Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tawrmac-A253 .

<title>Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges: (i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth $f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a \emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$. Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust learning.

<title>Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.

<title>Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings</title>

arXiv:2510.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record; second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.

<title>Learning Bug Context for PyTorch-to-JAX Translation with LLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited. Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge). Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50% on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100% on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster than the baseline.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable. Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings. In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three weeks. This is the first study to combine accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate smartwatch data collected over an extended monitoring period to classify intoxication levels. Previous research had used limited smartphone motion data and conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking episodes; in this work, we use smartwatch data and perform a thorough evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). We have compared performance metrics for the algorithms and assessed their efficiency on resource-constrained environments like mobile hardware. The HDC model achieved the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for smartwatch-based applications.

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However, it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages. First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise, especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations in neural networks.

<title>MemPromptTSS: Persistent Prompt Memory for Iterative Multi-Granularity Time Series State Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary operating regimes.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering (CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix. A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously. On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

<title>Homomorphic Mappings for Value-Preserving State Aggregation in Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative evaluations against seven algorithms.

<title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Flow-Matching Policies for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However, conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency, clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned, diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines, observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

<title>An Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection Approach for Efficient Online Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

<title>Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection</title>

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates than existing methods.

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability. To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B, HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn, the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore, STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25, AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current training pipelines. Our code is available at: https://github.com/princeton-pli/STAT.

<title>Efficient Onboard Vision-Language Inference in UAV-Enabled Low-Altitude Economy Networks via LLM-Enhanced Optimization</title>

arXiv:2510.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However, ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts: (i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion, introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet conditions.

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel, model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

<title>One4Many-StablePacker: An Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the 3D Bin Packing Problem</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms. First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with stability constraints.

<title>Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling</title>

arXiv:2510.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.

<title>ADEPT: Continual Pretraining via Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled Tuning</title>

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM) domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion, duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge. It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58% on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50% training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust domain-adaptive CPT.

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

<title>What Makes Looped Transformers Perform Better Than Non-Recursive Ones (Provably)</title>

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.

<title>Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.

<title>PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference. PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable, high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

<title>Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation</title>

arXiv:2510.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs (TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

<title>PermLLM: Learnable Channel Permutation for N:M Sparse Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization. Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series, Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at https://github.com/lanchengzou/PermLLM.

<title>Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance, leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore, the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations: (i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project page https://robustdiffusionpolicy.github.io

<title>Rethinking Entropy Interventions in RLVR: An Entropy Change Perspective</title>

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization. Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/STEER.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution. However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models (featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9 implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems, offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future research. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lif314/INR-Bench.

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem, CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

<title>Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation</title>

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code; however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings. We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level, while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems.Code is available at: https://github.com/gravitywavelet/sgm-anon.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881, outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3) In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities. Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size. Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information (a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce positional bias observed in LLMs.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training, requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1) fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3) premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making environments.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization, suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive (serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts, pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000 participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84, generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions. First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group inference.

<title>Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification</title>

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose \textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables. This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels, distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates, including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset, demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems, while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

<title>Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402</link>

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation. We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings, pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger models.

<title>Hierarchical LoRA MoE for Efficient CTR Model Scaling</title>

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR) prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts (MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment (ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared to the non-MoE baseline.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features, our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods. The implementation source can be found at https://github.com/huatxxx/MTL-FSL.

<title>Reverse Supervision at Scale: Exponential Search Meets the Economics of Annotation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10446</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster -- computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view, generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing. Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior. Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework. We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies, newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we \rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings. Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness, achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

<title>AnyBCQ: Hardware Efficient Flexible Binary-Coded Quantization for Multi-Precision LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10467</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility, quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly, bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse service-level objectives.

<title>Anchor-based Maximum Discrepancy for Relative Similarity Testing</title>

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions, P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously, instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U, Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I. Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/zhijianzhouml/AMD.

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments, enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug discovery.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed, offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$ equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after 12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease, demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of $10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce *f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation. We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation (**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions, demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR, restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods: noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around 0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%, confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features. This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional CDA approaches.

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets, suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds. Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction, making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity, providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives. Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary material.

<title>Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents</title>

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings. To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification accuracy.

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value functions within a Lipschitz space.

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning, issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics. Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply. However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using ablation studies.

<title>ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling. Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold, rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives, all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective, substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/OnlyLoveKFC/ProteinAE_v1.

<title>Trustworthy Retrosynthesis: Eliminating Hallucinations with a Diverse Ensemble of Reaction Scorers</title>

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations (compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES} and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models. Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Abstract: We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing. Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Steepest descent algorithms adapt to different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order, whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models, which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications, demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used. These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their most important elements.

<title>Crisis-Aware Regime-Conditioned Diffusion with CVaR Allocation</title>

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE) denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance. In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility. Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms) or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks that is on par with baseline approaches.

<title>Glance for Context: Learning When to Leverage LLMs for Node-Aware GNN-LLM Fusion</title>

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures, where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs without incurring high computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach - using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of (utility) testing accuracy.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE. LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively. Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.

<title>Redundancy as a Structural Information Principle for Learning and Generalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure) and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems, such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012 Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities. Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep, stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation. However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming, balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC# achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC# achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7% accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation, demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful, specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses, leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs. Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins, based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport (OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design, our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our code is available at https://github.com/BIRlz/APLOT

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across 1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those established for non-reasoning models.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level. Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models, and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace, preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation.

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations. InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space, thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user representation learning.

<title>The Easy Path to Robustness: Coreset Selection using Sample Hardness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its \textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm (AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN) are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary. Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\% and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models. However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism, `Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy, highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

<title>Efficient Edge Test-Time Adaptation via Latent Feature Coordinate Correction</title>

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while $\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore, we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge devices in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts. However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities, resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data availability.

arXiv:2510.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive, general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned, can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP). Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

<title>Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection in Thermal Images via Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

arXiv:2510.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for both two-sample and independence testing.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures, yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods (Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE, PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7 categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688, ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1: 0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance: differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL, which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's predictive power.

<title>ELMO: Efficiency via Low-precision and Peak Memory Optimization in Large Output Spaces</title>

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification (XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8, without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling. Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations -- gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method, Renee without compromising accuracy.

<title>EAGER: Entropy-Aware GEneRation for Adaptive Inference-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution, however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance. EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME 2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels, achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65% fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

<title>Can Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Generalize Across Diverse Domains?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains, enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning (TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination, fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking, tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the "Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction, descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs, when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation models.

<title>Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202</link>

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development, ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug, evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and spurious correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/pralab/vuln-localization-eval.

Abstract: We propose a new reservoir computing method for forecasting high-resolution spatiotemporal datasets. By combining multi-resolution inputs from coarser to finer layers, our architecture better captures both local and global dynamics. Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel reservoir models in long-term forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-layers coupling in improving predictive accuracy. Finally, we show that the optimal network dynamics in each layer become increasingly linear, revealing the slow modes propagated to subsequent layers.

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex, dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

<title>Neural Weight Compression for Language Models</title>

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However, as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual, trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly, and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1) column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly on par with FP16 models.

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining computationally efficient.

arXiv:2510.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs, nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii) semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values. This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data, demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where availability of unlabelled data could increase.

arXiv:2510.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However, in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix, which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously, by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a path to trusted capability

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various data-scarce environments.

Abstract: This paper presents Gym-TORAX, a Python package enabling the implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments for simulating plasma dynamics and control in tokamaks. Users define succinctly a set of control actions and observations, and a control objective from which Gym-TORAX creates a Gymnasium environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

arXiv:2510.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU. However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important. To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output. Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically, LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled, fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs. Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to 4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks, including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input long-output scenarios.

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another. It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation, helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that disentangles a time series into content and style representations via convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles: fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve performance on par with synchronous training.

arXiv:2510.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks. Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each propagating information independently through the graph topology. The aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning, which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD, stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$ tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms, diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model these techniques should be applied.

<title>FedHybrid: Breaking the Memory Wall of Federated Learning via Hybrid Tensor Management</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid} first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that \textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a 15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared with the baselines.

<title>Leveraging LLMs for Semi-Automatic Corpus Filtration in Systematic Literature Reviews</title>

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions. However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs), classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000 candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective. Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

<title>Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from 3-Lead ECG using Variational Autoencoder to Improve Cardiac Disease Detection of Wearable ECG Devices</title>

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However, their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable, low-cost cardiac screening.

<title>Iterative Amortized Inference: Unifying In-Context Learning and Learned Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches, including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled. Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

<title>Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained embedded systems.

<title>How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

<title>ReLook: Vision-Grounded RL with a Multimodal LLM Critic for Agentic Web Coding</title>

arXiv:2510.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.

<title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1) constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2) uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

<title>Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning Models to Upscale Evapotranspiration in the U.S. Midwest</title>

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM - and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE = 8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class correspondence.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S. equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are important for arbitrage trading.

<title>MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model</title>

arXiv:2510.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning. However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically, flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor. Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to integrate.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

<title>Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

<title>Representation-Based Exploration for Language Models: From Test-Time to Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled, representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50% improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model, demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond sharpening.

<title>Tight Regret Upper and Lower Bounds for Optimistic Hedge in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known, both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m \log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly, these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

<title>QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.

<title>Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition</title>

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks. Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs.

arXiv:2510.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances, general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges, including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health applications.

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model, conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines (ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score, calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events. Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable, and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.

<title>Hound: Relation-First Knowledge Graphs for Complex-System Reasoning in Security Audits</title>

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g., monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to support reproduction.

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users, leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently, individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper, we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism, Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting process through a novel, adaptive approach.

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process, emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: We introduce and address a novel distributed clustering problem where each participant has a private dataset containing only a subset of all available features, and some features are included in multiple datasets. This scenario occurs in many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where different institutions have complementary data on similar patients. We propose two different algorithms suitable for solving distributed clustering problems that exhibit this type of feature space heterogeneity. The first is a federated algorithm in which participants collaboratively update a set of global centroids. The second is a one-shot algorithm in which participants share a statistical parametrization of their local clusters with the central server, who generates and merges synthetic proxy datasets. In both cases, participants perform local clustering using algorithms of their choice, which provides flexibility and personalized computational costs. Pretending that local datasets result from splitting and masking an initial centralized dataset, we identify some conditions under which the proposed algorithms are expected to converge to the optimal centralized solution. Finally, we test the practical performance of the algorithms on three public datasets.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training. However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present \textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context reasoning.

However, existing machine learning approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Beyond AlphaEarth: Toward Human-Centered Spatial Representation via POI-Guided Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to improve downstream learning.

Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE) paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator. We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets, we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.

<title>Explainable Human-in-the-Loop Segmentation via Critic Feedback Signals</title>

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

<title>Beyond Fertility: Analyzing STRR as a Metric for Multilingual Tokenization Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09947</link>

arXiv:2510.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models (LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word), captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence (AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability, maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development. However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational settings.

Abstract: The highly non-convex optimization landscape of modern lens design necessitates extensive human expertise, resulting in inefficiency and constrained design diversity. While automated methods are desirable, existing approaches remain limited to simple tasks or produce complex lenses with suboptimal image quality. Drawing inspiration from the synaptic pruning mechanism in mammalian neural development, this study proposes OptiNeuro--a novel automated lens design framework that first generates diverse initial structures and then progressively eliminates low-performance lenses while refining remaining candidates through gradient-based optimization. By fully automating the design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, OptiNeuro demonstrates quasi-human-level performance, identifying multiple viable candidates with minimal human intervention. This advancement not only enhances the automation level and efficiency of lens design but also facilitates the exploration of previously uncharted lens architectures.

Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) research has been advanced, thanks to deep learning methods, it still suffers from obtaining inputs from large quality-labelled training data. Data augmentation methods have been attempted to mitigate this issue, generative models have shown success among them recently. We propose a data augmentation framework that is aided by cross-modal information transfer and mutual information regularization. Mutual information based metric can serve as an indicator for the quality. Furthermore, we expand this data augmentation scope to multimodal inputs, thanks to mutual information ensureing dependency between modalities. Our framework was tested on three benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV and MSP-Podcast. The implementation was designed to generate input features that are fed into last layer for emotion classification. Our framework improved the performance of emotion prediction against existing works. Also, we discovered that our framework is able to generate new inputs without any cross-modal information.

<title>Diversity Augmentation of Dynamic User Preference Data for Boosting Personalized Text Summarizers</title>

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However, training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging, particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t. PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics -- $\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity. We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving performance gains.

<title>Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%, respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably, it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lslland/Pharmacist.

Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case, it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for exploring scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

<title>The Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI): A Comprehensive Framework for Integrated Relational and Vector Search</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, multimodal datasets has exposed a critical gap between the capabilities of specialized vector databases and traditional graph databases. While vector databases excel at semantic similarity search, they lack the capacity for deep relational querying. Conversely, graph databases master complex traversals but are not natively optimized for high-dimensional vector search. This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for efficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph database architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by platforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) with expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework include modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure and query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to support dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural principles of systems like TigerVector. By integrating semantic similarity search directly with relational context, HMGI aims to outperform pure vector databases like Milvus in complex, relationship-heavy query scenarios and achieve sub-linear query times for hybrid tasks.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues, three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline - while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%. Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments, showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

We investigated (1) how users develop BCI control skills across repeated sessions and (2) perceptual and performance effects of two visual stimulation textures. Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) scores for Flow}, Positive Affect, Competence and Challenge were strongly positive, indicating sustained engagement. A within-subject study with multiple runs, two task complexities, and post-session questionnaires revealed no significant performance differences between textures but increased ocular irritation over time. Online metrics$\unicode{x2013}$Task Accuracy, Task Time, and Information Transfer Rate$\unicode{x2013}$improved across sessions, confirming learning effects for symbol spelling, even under pressure conditions. Our results highlight the potential of $\textit{BrainForm}$ as a scalable, user-friendly BCI research tool and offer guidance for sustained engagement and reduced training fatigue.

Abstract: The advancement of machine learning for compiler optimization, particularly within the polyhedral model, is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, public performance datasets. This data bottleneck forces researchers to undertake costly data generation campaigns, slowing down innovation and hindering reproducible research learned code optimization. To address this gap, we introduce LOOPerSet, a new public dataset containing 28 million labeled data points derived from 220,000 unique, synthetically generated polyhedral programs. Each data point maps a program and a complex sequence of semantics-preserving transformations (such as fusion, skewing, tiling, and parallelism)to a ground truth performance measurement (execution time). The scale and diversity of LOOPerSet make it a valuable resource for training and evaluating learned cost models, benchmarking new model architectures, and exploring the frontiers of automated polyhedral scheduling. The dataset is released under a permissive license to foster reproducible research and lower the barrier to entry for data-driven compiler optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy, indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query. These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects (KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error. Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar effects.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music generation is undergoing rapid developments, with recent symbolic models leveraging sophisticated deep learning and diffusion model algorithms. One drawback with existing models is that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure. Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis (SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.

Abstract: Profiling gamers provides critical insights for adaptive game design, behavioral understanding, and digital well-being. This study proposes an integrated, data-driven framework that combines psychological measures, behavioral analytics, and machine learning to reveal underlying gamer personas. A structured survey of 250 participants, including 113 active gamers, captured multidimensional behavioral, motivational, and social data. The analysis pipeline integrated feature engineering, association-network, knowledge-graph analysis, and unsupervised clustering to extract meaningful patterns. Correlation statistics uses Cramers V, Tschuprows T, Theils U, and Spearmans quantified feature associations, and network centrality guided feature selection. Dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, t-SNE are coupled with clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral, DBSCAN, evaluated using Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin indices. The PCA with K-Means with k = 4 model achieved optimal cluster quality with Silhouette = 0.4, identifying four archetypes as Immersive Social Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, and Competitive Team-Builders. This research contributes a reproducible pipeline that links correlation-driven network insights with unsupervised learning. The integration of behavioral correlation networks with clustering not only enhances classification accuracy but also offers a holistic lens to connect gameplay motivations with psychological and wellness outcomes.

<title>Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation</title>

Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier (upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes, achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model. In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution, quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than parametric variational cut approaches.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate the three challenges simultaneously.

Abstract: Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways, without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness, transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level understanding.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other functional mappings. \textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training, FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However, the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects. Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused, accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass (CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

Abstract: Aerosol-cloud--radiation interactions remain among the most uncertain components of the Earth's climate system, in partdue to the high dimensionality of aerosol state representations and the difficulty of obtaining complete \textit{in situ} measurements. Addressing these challenges requires methods that distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful forms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a framework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated mass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol size-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original dimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage and processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are easiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult, and ice nucleation properties are the most challenging. To improve performance, we introduce a preprocessing optimization strategy that avoids repeated retraining and yields latent representations resilient to high-magnitude Gaussian noise, boosting accuracy for CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and frozen fraction spectra. Finally, we propose a novel realism metric -- based on the sliced Wasserstein distance between generated samples and a held-out test set -- for optimizing the KL divergence weight in VAEs. Together, these contributions enable compact, robust, and physically meaningful representations of aerosol states for large-scale climate applications.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion. Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact, surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks, notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations, such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other 2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round. To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks -- RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) -- and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation of this critical capability.

<title>Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes</title>

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments. Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances (up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used approach for top-N recommendation and collaborative filtering. When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix factorization for recommender systems.

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5% using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within 5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features. Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion. Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

<title>The Hidden DNA of LLM-Generated JavaScript: Structural Patterns Enable High-Accuracy Authorship Attribution</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications. Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks, surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in real-world robotics systems.

Abstract: This research develops a sentiment-driven quantitative trading system that leverages a large language model, FinGPT, for sentiment analysis, and explores a novel method for signal integration using a reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). We compare the performance of strategies that integrate sentiment and technical signals using both a conventional rule-based approach and a reinforcement learning framework. The results suggest that sentiment signals generated by FinGPT offer value when combined with traditional technical indicators, and that reinforcement learning algorithm presents a promising approach for effectively integrating heterogeneous signals in dynamic trading environments.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably, AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

<title>MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The journal preprint version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis of our proposed joint learning strategy.

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However, existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper, we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse masks.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize instructions according to student profiles.

Abstract: Interactive composition simulations in Earth System Models (ESMs) are computationally expensive as they transport numerous gaseous and aerosol tracers at each timestep. This limits higher-resolution transient climate simulations with current computational resources. ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3 (ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs. While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time feedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on pre-calculated fields. We extended the ModelE NINT version using machine learning (ML) to create Smart NINT, which emulates interactive emissions. Smart NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels (from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa), then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications, arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\in (1,2]$, and establish tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed regimes.

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.

Abstract: We define a stochastic variant of the proximal point algorithm in the general setting of nonlinear (separable) Hadamard spaces for approximating zeros of the mean of a stochastically perturbed monotone vector field and prove its convergence under a suitable strong monotonicity assumption, together with a probabilistic independence assumption and a separability assumption on the tangent spaces. As a particular case, our results transfer previous work by P. Bianchi on that method in Hilbert spaces for the first time to Hadamard manifolds. Moreover, our convergence proof is fully effective and allows for the construction of explicit rates of convergence for the iteration towards the (unique) solution both in mean and almost surely. These rates are moreover highly uniform, being independent of most data surrounding the iteration, space or distribution. In that generality, these rates are novel already in the context of Hilbert spaces. Linear nonasymptotic guarantees under additional second-moment conditions on the Yosida approximates and special cases of stochastic convex minimization are discussed.

Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph as an arbitrary-order stream of edges, with each edge labeled as positive or negative, the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such that the number of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first learning-augmented streaming algorithms for the problem on both complete and general graphs, improving the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based on the works of Cambus et al. (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our algorithms use the predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm achieves a better-than-$3$ approximation under good prediction quality, while using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log |E^-|)$ approximation under good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space, improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over their non-learning counterparts.

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

Abstract: We present a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver that combines truncated log signatures with a neural rough differential equation backbone for high dimensional, path dependent valuation and control. The design aligns stochastic analysis with sequence to path learning, using a CVaR tilted objective to emphasize left tail risk and an optional second order head for risk sensitive control. Under equal compute and parameter budgets, the method improves accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option pricing and portfolio control tasks. At 200 dimensions, it achieves CVaR(0.99) = 9.8 percent compared to 12.0-13.1 percent for strong baselines, while attaining low HJB residuals and small RMSE for Z and Gamma. Ablations confirm complementary gains from the sequence to path representation and the second order structure. Overall, the results show that combining stochastic analysis with modern deep learning expands the class of solvable path dependent financial models at scale.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture human-environment relationships.

<title>How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data</title>

Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language - has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.

Abstract: Persian Language, despite being spoken by over 100 million people worldwide, remains severely underrepresented in high-quality speech corpora, particularly for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis applications. Existing Persian speech datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed specifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000 audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470 speakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset, offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate the development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for other low-resource languages. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at ParsVoice (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice).

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

<title>Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Abstract: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge. A novel approach that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.

<title>Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature, existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error, enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in transfer learning.

Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF. Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&amp;CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing. DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization, color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy (2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch implementation to facilitate further research.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including $\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring, particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles. To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST (Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates, highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains like hiring.

Abstract: Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is essential for reducing I/O overhead and improving database performance. While traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning. Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets, necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to predict delta patterns from embedded context. This delta modeling approach enables GrASP to generalize predictions from small samples to larger, dynamic datasets without requiring extensive retraining. Experiments on real-world datasets and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that GrASP generalizes to datasets 250 times larger than the training data, achieving up to 45% higher hit ratios, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower end-to-end query execution latency than existing baselines. On average, GrASP attains a 91.4% hit ratio, a 90.8% I/O time reduction, and a 57.1% execution latency reduction.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying, and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task goals, and natural motion patterns.

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery scenarios.

<title>Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials</title>

Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.

Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences, and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.

<title>Machine Learning-Integrated Hybrid Fluid-Kinetic Framework for Quantum Electrodynamic Laser Plasma Simulations</title>

Abstract: High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination (R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy. Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs, enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point operations.

<title>Discursive Circuits: How Do Language Models Understand Discourse Relations?</title>

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning. To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery. Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model) recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT. Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g., coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images. Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives. Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m, while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in mega-constellations.

<title>Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers</title>

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot. The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work, we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development, assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.
  The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key deterministic and probabilistic metrics.
  Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling, calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that could affect the comparability of different approaches.
  As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation, and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes. A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$ and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller 99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

<title>$\Delta \mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization</title>

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year. Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations, yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings compared to BP-based approaches.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3, and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.

Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.

<title>A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.

<title>MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS) strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation.

Abstract: For reliable large-scale quantum computation, a quantum error correction (QEC) scheme must effectively resolve physical errors to protect logical information. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach provides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding, advancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space. We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability in user-centric settings.

<title>Deconstructing Attention: Investigating Design Principles for Effective Language Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states (grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In these lecture notes, we first recall the connection between graph neural networks, Weisfeiler-Lehman tests and logics such as first-order logic and graded modal logic. We then present a modal logic in which counting modalities appear in linear inequalities in order to solve verification tasks on graph neural networks. We describe an algorithm for the satisfiability problem of that logic. It is inspired from the tableau method of vanilla modal logic, extended with reasoning in quantifier-free fragment Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic.

<title>NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: We study the sublinear space continual release model for edge-differentially private (DP) graph algorithms, with a focus on the densest subgraph problem (DSG) in the insertion-only setting. Our main result is the first continual release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP algorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming algorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\log n)$ additive error and $O(n\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems. In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments are further provided to validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness: even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes, including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Abstract: Loss function learning is a new meta-learning paradigm that aims to automate the essential task of designing a loss function for a machine learning model. Existing techniques for loss function learning have shown promising results, often improving a model's training dynamics and final inference performance. However, a significant limitation of these techniques is that the loss functions are meta-learned in an offline fashion, where the meta-objective only considers the very first few steps of training, which is a significantly shorter time horizon than the one typically used for training deep neural networks. This causes significant bias towards loss functions that perform well at the very start of training but perform poorly at the end of training. To address this issue we propose a new loss function learning technique for adaptively updating the loss function online after each update to the base model parameters. The experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the cross-entropy loss and offline loss function learning techniques on a diverse range of neural network architectures and datasets.

Abstract: We propose a novel theoretical and methodological framework for Gaussian process regression subject to privacy constraints. The proposed method can be used when a data owner is unwilling to share a high-fidelity supervised learning model built from their data with the public due to privacy concerns. The key idea of the proposed method is to add synthetic noise to the data until the predictive variance of the Gaussian process model reaches a prespecified privacy level. The optimal covariance matrix of the synthetic noise is formulated in terms of semi-definite programming. We also introduce the formulation of privacy-aware solutions under continuous privacy constraints using kernel-based approaches, and study their theoretical properties. The proposed method is illustrated by considering a model that tracks the trajectories of satellites and a real application on a census dataset.

Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) algorithms are notably brittle when data is scarce, inferring unreliable causal relations that may contradict expert knowledge, especially when considering latent confounders. Furthermore, the lack of uncertainty quantification in most CD methods hinders users from diagnosing and refining results. To address these issues, we introduce Ancestral GFlowNets (AGFNs). AGFN samples ancestral graphs (AGs) proportionally to a score-based belief distribution representing our epistemic uncertainty over the causal relationships. Building upon this distribution, we propose an elicitation framework for expert-driven assessment. This framework comprises an optimal experimental design to probe the expert and a scheme to incorporate the obtained feedback into AGFN. Our experiments show that: i) AGFN is competitive against other methods that address latent confounding on both synthetic and real-world datasets; and ii) our design for incorporating feedback from a (simulated) human expert or a Large Language Model (LLM) improves inference quality.

Abstract: The increasing scale of data propels the popularity of leveraging parallelism to speed up the optimization. Minibatch stochastic gradient descent (minibatch SGD) and local SGD are two popular methods for parallel optimization. The existing theoretical studies show a linear speedup of these methods with respect to the number of machines, which, however, is measured by optimization errors in a multi-pass setting. As a comparison, the stability and generalization of these methods are much less studied. In this paper, we study the stability and generalization analysis of minibatch and local SGD to understand their learnability by introducing an expectation-variance decomposition. We incorporate training errors into the stability analysis, which shows how small training errors help generalization for overparameterized models. We show minibatch and local SGD achieve a linear speedup to attain the optimal risk bounds.

Abstract: Most problems within and beyond the scientific domain can be framed into one of the following three levels of complexity of function approximation. Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.

Abstract: Revealing hidden causal variables alongside the underlying causal mechanisms is essential to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, existing practice in causal discovery (CD) heavily relies on high-quality measured variables, which are usually given by human experts. In fact, the lack of well-defined high-level variables behind unstructured data has been a longstanding roadblock to a broader real-world application of CD. This procedure can naturally benefit from an automated process that can suggest potential hidden variables in the system. Interestingly, Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in processing unstructured data. To leverage the power of LLMs, we develop a new framework termed Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that incorporates the rich world knowledge of LLMs to propose useful measured variables for CD with respect to high-value target variables on their paired unstructured data. Instead of directly inferring causality with LLMs, COAT constructs feedback from intermediate CD results to LLMs to refine the proposed variables. Given the target variable and the paired unstructured data, we first develop COAT-MB that leverages the predictivity of the proposed variables to iteratively uncover the Markov Blanket of the target variable. Built upon COAT-MB, COAT-PAG further extends to uncover a more complete causal graph, i.e., Partial Ancestral Graph, by iterating over the target variables and actively seeking new high-level variables. Moreover, the reliable CD capabilities of COAT also extend the debiased causal inference to unstructured data by discovering an adjustment set. We establish theoretical guarantees for the CD results and verify their efficiency and reliability across realistic benchmarks and real-world case studies.

Abstract: Monitoring the inner state of deep neural networks is essential for auditing the learning process and enabling timely interventions. While conventional metrics like validation loss offer a surface-level view of performance, the evolution of a model's hidden representations provides a deeper, complementary window into its internal dynamics. However, the literature lacks a real-time tool to monitor these crucial internal states. To address this, we introduce SentryCam, a live-update visualization framework that tracks the progression of hidden representations throughout training. SentryCam produces high-fidelity visualizations of the evolving representation space with minimal latency, serving as a powerful dashboard for understanding how a model learns. We quantitatively validate the faithfulness of SentryCam's visualizations across diverse datasets and architectures (ResNet, ViT). Furthermore, we demonstrate SentryCam's practical utility for model auditing through a case study on training instability. We designed an automated auditing system with geometry-based alerts that successfully identified impending model failure up to 7 epochs earlier than was evident from the validation loss curve. SentryCam's flexible framework is easily adaptable, supporting both the exploratory analysis and proactive auditing essential for robust model development. The code is available at https://github.com/xianglinyang/SentryCam.

Abstract: Incorporating domain-specific constraints into machine learning models is essential for generating predictions that are both accurate and feasible in real-world applications. This paper introduces new methods for training Output-Constrained Regression Trees (OCRT), addressing the limitations of traditional decision trees in constrained multi-target regression tasks. We propose three approaches: M-OCRT, which uses split-based mixed integer programming to enforce constraints; E-OCRT, which employs an exhaustive search for optimal splits and solves constrained prediction problems at each decision node; and EP-OCRT, which applies post-hoc constrained optimization to tree predictions. To illustrate their potential uses in ensemble learning, we also introduce a random forest framework working under convex feasible sets. We validate the proposed methods through a computational study both on synthetic and industry-driven hierarchical time series datasets. Our results demonstrate that imposing constraints on decision tree training results in accurate and feasible predictions.

Abstract: Users of modern Machine Learning (ML) cloud services face a privacy conundrum -- on one hand, they may have concerns about sending private data to the service for inference, but on the other hand, for specialized models, there may be no alternative but to use the proprietary model of the ML service. In this work, we present LDPKiT, a framework for non-adversarial, privacy-preserving model extraction that leverages a user's private in-distribution data while bounding privacy leakage. LDPKiT introduces a novel superimposition technique that generates approximately in-distribution samples, enabling effective knowledge transfer under local differential privacy (LDP). Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and PathMNIST demonstrate that LDPKiT consistently improves utility while maintaining privacy, with benefits that become more pronounced at stronger noise levels. For example, on SVHN, LDPKiT achieves nearly the same inference accuracy at $\epsilon=1.25$ as at $\epsilon=2.0$, yielding stronger privacy guarantees with less than a 2% accuracy reduction. We further conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of dataset size on performance and provide a systematic analysis of latent space representations, offering theoretical insights into the accuracy gains of LDPKiT.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.

<title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>

Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size and deployment scale, quantization has become an essential technique for reducing memory footprint and improving inference efficiency. However, existing quantization toolkits often lack transparency, flexibility, and system-level scalability across GPUs and distributed environments. We present \textbf{LLMEasyQuant}, a modular, system-aware quantization framework designed for efficient, low-bit inference of LLMs on single-node multi-GPU, multi-node, and edge hardware. LLMEasyQuant supports a wide range of quantization methods -- including Symmetric Quantization, ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and SimQuant -- with unified interfaces for per-layer calibration, bitwidth assignment, and runtime adaptation. It integrates fused CUDA kernels with NCCL-based distributed synchronization and supports both static and online quantization. Empirical results show that LLMEasyQuant can achieve substantial speedup in GEMM execution, HBM load time, and near-linear multi-GPU scaling. Ablation studies further validate its ability to balance latency, memory, and accuracy under diverse deployment conditions. LLMEasyQuant offers a practical quantization serving system for scalable, hardware-optimized LLM inference.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability methods aim to identify the algorithm a neural network implements, but it is difficult to validate such methods when the true algorithm is unknown. This work presents InterpBench, a collection of semi-synthetic yet realistic transformers with known circuits for evaluating these techniques. We train simple neural networks using a stricter version of Interchange Intervention Training (IIT) which we call Strict IIT (SIIT). Like the original, SIIT trains neural networks by aligning their internal computation with a desired high-level causal model, but it also prevents non-circuit nodes from affecting the model's output. We evaluate SIIT on sparse transformers produced by the Tracr tool and find that SIIT models maintain Tracr's original circuit while being more realistic. SIIT can also train transformers with larger circuits, like Indirect Object Identification (IOI). Finally, we use our benchmark to evaluate existing circuit discovery techniques.

Abstract: This work presents an analytical framework for the design and analysis of LLM-based algorithms, i.e., algorithms that contain one or multiple calls of large language models (LLMs) as sub-routines and critically rely on the capabilities of LLMs. While such algorithms, ranging from basic LLM calls with prompt engineering to complicated LLM-powered agentic workflows and compound AI systems, have achieved remarkable empirical success, their design and optimization oftentimes require extensive trial-and-errors and case-by-case analysis. Our proposed framework serves as an attempt to mitigate such headaches, offering a formal and systematic approach for analyzing how the accuracy and efficiency of an LLM-based algorithm will be impacted by critical design choices, such as the pattern and granularity of task decomposition, or the prompt for each LLM call. Through a wide range of case studies covering diverse algorithm patterns (including parallel/hierarchical/recursive task decomposition and generic directed acyclic graphs), we demonstrate the proposed framework in action and derive interesting insights that generalize across scenarios, accompanied by systematic empirical validation in synthetic settings.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to hydrologic modeling is fledgling. Its applicability to capture the dependencies on watersheds to forecast better within a short period is fascinating. One of the key reasons to adopt ML algorithms over physics-based models is its computational efficiency advantage and flexibility to work with various data sets. The diverse applications, particularly in emergency response and expanding over a large scale, demand the hydrological model in a short time and make researchers adopt data-driven modeling approaches unhesitatingly. In this work, in the era of ML and deep learning (DL), how it can help to improve the overall run time of physics-based model and potential constraints that should be addressed while modeling. This paper covers the opportunities and challenges of adopting ML for hydrological modeling and subsequently how it can help to improve the simulation time of physics-based models and future works that should be addressed.

Abstract: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of patients with sepsis and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. Given the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor microcirculatory alterations, we propose a deep learning approach to automated sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction using a single HSI cube acquired within seconds. In a prospective observational study, we collected HSI data from the palms and fingers of more than 480 intensive care unit patients. Neural networks applied to HSI measurements predicted sepsis and mortality with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Performance improved substantially with additional clinical data, reaching AUROCs of 0.94 for sepsis and 0.83 for mortality. We conclude that deep learning-based HSI analysis enables rapid and noninvasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, with a potential clinical value for enhancing diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.
  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Neuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on average $1.49\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference.

Abstract: While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery. The source code for Retrieval-Retro is available at https://github.com/HeewoongNoh/Retrieval-Retro.

Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.

<title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>

Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times. To help further research and development, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning is gaining increasing attention thanks to its capability to learn complex policies in high-dimensional settings. Recent advancements utilize a dual-network architecture to learn optimal policies through the Q-learning algorithm. However, this approach has notable drawbacks, such as an overestimation bias that can disrupt the learning process and degrade the performance of the resulting policy. To address this, novel algorithms have been developed that mitigate overestimation bias by employing multiple Q-functions. Edge scenarios, which prioritize privacy, have recently gained prominence. In these settings, limited computational resources pose a significant challenge for complex Machine Learning approaches, making the efficiency of algorithms crucial for their performance. In this work, we introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning algorithm tailored for edge scenarios, called Edge Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EdgeD3). EdgeD3 enhances the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, achieving significantly improved performance with $25\%$ less Graphics Process Unit (GPU) time while maintaining the same memory usage. Additionally, EdgeD3 consistently matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, all while using $30\%$ fewer computational resources and requiring $30\%$ less memory.

Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the speed and reliability of radioisotope identification using gamma spectroscopy. However, meticulously labeling an experimental dataset for training is often prohibitively expensive, while training models purely on synthetic data is risky due to the domain gap between simulated and experimental measurements. In this research, we demonstrate that supervised domain adaptation can substantially improve the performance of radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between synthetic and experimental data domains. We consider two domain adaptation scenarios: (1) a simulation-to-simulation adaptation, where we perform multi-label proportion estimation using simulated high-purity germanium detectors, and (2) a simulation-to-experimental adaptation, where we perform multi-class, single-label classification using measured spectra from handheld lanthanum bromide (LaBr) and sodium iodide (NaI) detectors. We begin by pretraining a spectral classifier on synthetic data using a custom transformer-based neural network. After subsequent fine-tuning on just 64 labeled experimental spectra, we achieve a test accuracy of 96% in the sim-to-real scenario with a LaBr detector, far surpassing a synthetic-only baseline model (75%) and a model trained from scratch (80%) on the same 64 spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-adapted models learn more human-interpretable features than experiment-only baseline models. Overall, our results highlight the potential for supervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap in radioisotope identification, enabling the development of accurate and explainable classifiers even in real-world scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.

Abstract: The primary promise of decentralized learning is to allow users to engage in the training of machine learning models in a collaborative manner while keeping their data on their premises and without relying on any central entity. However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g., Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g., number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. We also empirically show that enhancing mixing properties is highly beneficial when combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.

Abstract: Transformer-based models demonstrate a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a few prompt examples without parameter updates. Recent research has illuminated how Transformers perform ICL, showing that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent for linear least-squares objectives when trained on random linear regression tasks. Building on this, we investigate ICL for nonlinear function classes. We first prove that LSA is inherently incapable of outperforming linear predictors on nonlinear tasks, underscoring why prior solutions cannot readily extend to these problems. To overcome this limitation, we analyze a Transformer block consisting of LSA and feed-forward layers inspired by the gated linear units (GLU), which is a standard component of modern Transformers. We show that this block achieves nonlinear ICL by implementing one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression loss. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the expressivity of a single block is inherently limited by its dimensions. We then show that a deep Transformer can overcome this bottleneck by distributing the computation of richer kernel functions across multiple blocks, performing block-coordinate descent in a high-dimensional feature space that a single block cannot represent. Our findings highlight that the feed-forward layers provide a crucial and scalable mechanism by which Transformers can express nonlinear representations for ICL.

Abstract: The emergence of modern compute infrastructure for iterative optimization has led to great interest in developing optimization-based approaches for a scalable computation of $k$-SVD, i.e., the $k\geq 1$ largest singular values and corresponding vectors of a matrix of rank $d \geq 1$. Despite lots of exciting recent works, all prior works fall short in this pursuit. Specifically, the existing results are either for the exact-parameterized (i.e., $k = d$) and over-parameterized (i.e., $k > d$) settings; or only establish local convergence guarantees; or use a step-size that requires problem-instance-specific oracle-provided information. In this work, we complete this pursuit by providing a gradient-descent method with a simple, universal rule for step-size selection (akin to pre-conditioning), that provably finds $k$-SVD for a matrix of any rank $d \geq 1$. We establish that the gradient method with random initialization enjoys global linear convergence for any $k, d \geq 1$. Our convergence analysis reveals that the gradient method has an attractive region, and within this attractive region, the method behaves like Heron's method (a.k.a. the Babylonian method). Our analytic results about the said attractive region imply that the gradient method can be enhanced by means of Nesterov's momentum-based acceleration technique. The resulting improved convergence rates match those of rather complicated methods typically relying on Lanczos iterations or variants thereof. We provide an empirical study to validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We provide a theoretical analysis on a linear model to highlight the importance of learning both the down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We validate the insights on a non-linear model and separately provide a convergence proof under general conditions. To bridge theory and practice, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations on language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks and FL settings to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.

Abstract: Human label variation (HLV) challenges the standard assumption that a labelled instance has a single ground truth, instead embracing the natural variation in human annotation to train and evaluate models. While various training methods and metrics for HLV have been proposed, it is still unclear which methods and metrics perform best in what settings. We propose new evaluation metrics for HLV leveraging fuzzy set theory. Since these new proposed metrics are differentiable, we then in turn experiment with employing these metrics as training objectives. We conduct an extensive study over 6 HLV datasets testing 14 training methods and 6 evaluation metrics. We find that training on either disaggregated annotations or soft labels performs best across metrics, outperforming training using the proposed training objectives with differentiable metrics. We also show that our proposed soft micro F1 score is one of the best metrics for HLV data.

Abstract: Why rely on dense neural networks and then blindly sparsify them when prior knowledge about the problem structure is already available? Many inverse problems admit algorithm-unrolled networks that naturally encode physics and sparsity. In this work, we propose a Physics-Inspired Binary Neural Network (PIBiNN) that combines two key components: (i) data-driven one-bit quantization with a single global scale, and (ii) problem-driven sparsity predefined by physics and requiring no updates during training. This design yields compression rates below one bit per weight by exploiting structural zeros, while preserving essential operator geometry. Unlike ternary or pruning-based schemes, our approach avoids ad-hoc sparsification, reduces metadata overhead, and aligns directly with the underlying task. Experiments suggest that PIBiNN achieves advantages in both memory efficiency and generalization compared to competitive baselines such as ternary and channel-wise quantization.

Abstract: Causal knowledge can be used to support decision-making problems. This has been recognized in the causal bandits literature, where a causal (multi-armed) bandit is characterized by a causal graphical model and a target variable. The arms are then interventions on the causal model, and rewards are samples of the target variable. Causal bandits were originally studied with a focus on hard interventions. We focus instead on cases where the arms are conditional interventions, which more accurately model many real-world decision-making problems by allowing the value of the intervened variable to be chosen based on the observed values of other variables. This paper presents a graphical characterization of the minimal set of nodes guaranteed to contain the optimal conditional intervention, which maximizes the expected reward. We then propose an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(|V| + |E|)$ to identify this minimal set of nodes. We prove that the graphical characterization and the proposed algorithm are correct. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm significantly prunes the search space and substantially accelerates convergence rates when integrated into standard multi-armed bandit algorithms.

Abstract: Conditional-independence-based discovery uses statistical tests to identify a graphical model that represents the independence structure of variables in a dataset. These tests, however, can be unreliable, and algorithms are sensitive to errors and violated assumptions. Often, there are tests that were not used in the construction of the graph. In this work, we show that these redundant tests have the potential to detect or sometimes correct errors in the learned model. But we further show that not all tests contain this additional information and that such redundant tests have to be applied with care. Precisely, we argue that the conditional (in)dependence statements that hold for every probability distribution are unlikely to detect and correct errors - in contrast to those that follow only from graphical assumptions.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, thereby eliminating the need for costly CFD meshing procedures for inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated theorem proving use Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate informal mathematical statements into formal proofs. However, informal cues are often ambiguous or lack strict logical structure, making it hard for models to interpret them precisely. While existing methods achieve strong performance, little is known about how LLMs internally represent informal cues, or how these influence proof generation. To address this, we explore \textit{activation steering}, an inference-time intervention that identifies linear directions in residual activations associated with informal reasoning traces and adjusts them to improve proof construction without fine-tuning. This mechanism also yields interpretable information about how reasoning is internally encoded in the activation space of LLMs. We test our method for generating formal proofs from already-formalized theorems. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel activation-based intervention for guiding proof synthesis in LLMs; and (2) demonstration that this intervention improves performance under two decoding strategies (sampling and best-first search) without any further training.

Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) extends conventional Federated Learning (FL) by introducing intermediate aggregation layers, enabling distributed learning in geographically dispersed environments, particularly relevant for smart IoT systems, such as remote monitoring and battlefield operations, where cellular connectivity is limited. In these scenarios, UAVs serve as mobile aggregators, dynamically connecting terrestrial IoT devices. This paper investigates an HFL architecture with energy-constrained, dynamically deployed UAVs prone to communication disruptions. We propose a novel approach to minimize global training costs by formulating a joint optimization problem that integrates learning configuration, bandwidth allocation, and device-to-UAV association, ensuring timely global aggregation before UAV disconnections and redeployments. The problem accounts for dynamic IoT devices and intermittent UAV connectivity and is NP-hard. To tackle this, we decompose it into three subproblems: \textit{(i)} optimizing learning configuration and bandwidth allocation via an augmented Lagrangian to reduce training costs; \textit{(ii)} introducing a device fitness score based on data heterogeneity (via Kullback-Leibler divergence), device-to-UAV proximity, and computational resources, using a TD3-based algorithm for adaptive device-to-UAV assignment; \textit{(iii)} developing a low-complexity two-stage greedy strategy for UAV redeployment and global aggregator selection, ensuring efficient aggregation despite UAV disconnections. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the approach, demonstrating cost reduction and robust performance under communication disruptions.

Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue, but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MoE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/HBP.

Abstract: A novel formulation of the clustering problem is introduced in which the task is expressed as an estimation problem, where the object to be estimated is a function which maps a point to its distribution of cluster membership. Unlike existing approaches which implicitly estimate such a function, like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), the proposed approach bypasses any explicit modelling assumptions and exploits the flexible estimation potential of nonparametric smoothing. An intuitive approach for selecting the tuning parameters governing estimation is provided, which allows the proposed method to automatically determine both an appropriate level of flexibility and also the number of clusters to extract from a given data set. Experiments on a large collection of publicly available data sets are used to document the strong performance of the proposed approach, in comparison with relevant benchmarks from the literature. R code to implement the proposed approach is available from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/CNS

Abstract: 3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity. Our code is released at https://github.com/lyc0930/UAE-3D/.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of LLMs has prompted researchers to integrate language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.

Abstract: Layer normalization (LN) is an essential component of modern neural networks. While many alternative techniques have been proposed, none of them have succeeded in replacing LN so far. The latest suggestion in this line of research is a dynamic activation function called Dynamic Tanh (DyT). Although it is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between LN and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from the LN variant RMSNorm, and show that a well-defined decoupling in derivative space as well as an approximation are needed to do so. By applying the same decoupling procedure directly in function space, we are able to omit the approximation and obtain the exact element-wise counterpart of RMSNorm, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). We demonstrate numerically that DyISRU reproduces the normalization effect on outliers more accurately than DyT does.

Abstract: The increasing number of satellites and orbital debris has made space congestion a critical issue, threatening satellite safety and sustainability. Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Existing Learning-to-Defer (L2D) frameworks are limited to single-expert deferral, forcing each query to rely on only one expert and preventing the use of collective expertise. We introduce the first framework for Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, which allocates queries to the $k$ most cost-effective entities. Our formulation unifies and strictly generalizes prior approaches, including the one-stage and two-stage regimes, selective prediction, and classical cascades. In particular, it recovers the usual Top-1 deferral rule as a special case while enabling principled collaboration with multiple experts when $k>1$. We further propose Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive variant that learns the optimal number of experts per query based on input difficulty, expert quality, and consultation cost. To enable practical learning, we develop a novel surrogate loss that is Bayes-consistent, $\mathcal{H}_h$-consistent in the one-stage setting, and $(\mathcal{H}_r,\mathcal{H}_g)$-consistent in the two-stage setting. Crucially, this surrogate is independent of $k$, allowing a single policy to be learned once and deployed flexibly across $k$. Experiments across both regimes show that Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ deliver superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, opening a new direction for multi-expert deferral in L2D.

Abstract: We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the generalization gap accumulates slowly along the direction of training, charactering a benign training process. We provide novel perspectives for explaining the generalization ability of neural network training with different datasets and architectures through the alignment pattern of the ``residual" and the ``effective Gram matrix".

Abstract: Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4\% absolute on SAT MATH). Furthermore, we benchmark our PRM against existing open-source reward models, demonstrating superior alignment with reasoning quality and more consistent guidance for downstream generation. Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks enabling enabling ubiquitous communication as well as new services. However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhanced long-context language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual sampling. However, HyperAttention fails to find all significant keys, which in turn raises the overall perplexity. We propose a pre-scoring mechanism that prioritizes significant keys before applying HyperAttention. We introduce three scoring methods: $k$-means and kernel $k$-means clustering, $k$-median clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform residual sampling, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism. Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3, which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given specific parameters. Although this method introduces some computational overhead, its combination with HyperAttention achieves up to 20 times faster than FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving transformer efficiency.

Abstract: Many prediction problems across science and engineering, especially in finance and economics, involve large cross-sections of individual time series, where each unit (e.g., a loan, stock, or customer) is driven by unit-level features and latent cross-sectional dynamics. While sequence models have advanced per-unit temporal prediction, capturing cross-sectional effects often still relies on hand-crafted summary features. We propose Set-Sequence, a model that learns cross-sectional structure directly, enhancing expressivity and eliminating manual feature engineering. At each time step, a permutation-invariant Set module summarizes the unit set; a Sequence module then models each unit's dynamics conditioned on both its features and the learned summary. The architecture accommodates unaligned series, supports varying numbers of units at inference, integrates with standard sequence backbones (e.g., Transformers), and scales linearly in cross-sectional size. Across a synthetic contagion task and two large-scale real-world applications, equity portfolio optimization and loan risk prediction, Set-Sequence significantly outperforms strong baselines, delivering higher Sharpe ratios, improved AUCs, and interpretable cross-sectional summaries.

<title>Quantization Meets Reasoning: Exploring and Mitigating Degradation of Low-Bit LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: 1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation for their practical use.

Abstract: Unlike conventional "black-box" transformers with classical self-attention mechanism, we build a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net by unrolling a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm to forecast traffic with spatial and temporal dimensions. We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically. Our code is available in https://github.com/SingularityUndefined/Unrolling-GSP-STForecast .

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned-pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 50x compression, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 224x compression, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 132x compression, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 18x compression, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaohuiwang000/UltraDelta.

Abstract: Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA, a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation. At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Abstract: Macro-aligned micro-records are crucial for credible simulations in social science and urban studies. For example, epidemic models are only reliable when individual-level mobility and contacts mirror real behavior, while aggregates match real-world statistics like case counts or travel flows. However, collecting such fine-grained data at scale is impractical, leaving researchers with only macro-level data. LLMSynthor addresses this by turning a pretrained LLM into a macro-aware simulator that generates realistic micro-records consistent with target macro-statistics. It iteratively builds synthetic datasets: in each step, the LLM generates batches of records to minimize discrepancies between synthetic and target aggregates. Treating the LLM as a nonparametric copula allows the model to capture realistic joint dependencies among variables. To improve efficiency, LLM Proposal Sampling guides the LLM to propose targeted record batches, specifying variable ranges and counts, to efficiently correct discrepancies while preserving realism grounded in the model's priors. Evaluations across domains (mobility, e-commerce, population) show that LLMSynthor achieves strong realism, statistical fidelity, and practical utility, making it broadly applicable to economics, social science, and urban studies.

<title>Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator</title>

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.

Abstract: In an era defined by rapid data evolution, traditional Machine Learning (ML) models often fall short in adapting to dynamic environments. Evolving Machine Learning (EML) has emerged as a critical paradigm, enabling continuous learning and adaptation in real-time data streams. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of EML, focusing on five core challenges: data drift, concept drift, catastrophic forgetting, skewed learning, and network adaptation. We systematically review over 100 studies, categorizing state-of-the-art methods across supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches. The survey explores diverse evaluation metrics, benchmark datasets, and real-world applications, offering a comparative lens on the effectiveness and limitations of current techniques. Additionally, we highlight the growing role of adaptive neural architectures, meta-learning, and ensemble strategies in addressing evolving data complexities. By synthesizing insights from recent literature, this work not only maps the current landscape of EML but also identifies critical gaps and opportunities for future research. Our findings aim to guide researchers and practitioners in developing robust, ethical, and scalable EML systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA, and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code (HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard +4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-1.5-Demo/.

Abstract: Training large neural networks (NNs) requires optimizing high-dimensional data-dependent loss functions. The optimization landscape of these functions is often highly complex and textured, even fractal-like, with many spurious local minima, ill-conditioned valleys, degenerate points, and saddle points. Complicating things further is the fact that these landscape characteristics are a function of the data, meaning that noise in the training data can propagate forward and give rise to unrepresentative small-scale geometry. This poses a difficulty for gradient-based optimization methods, which rely on local geometry to compute updates and are, therefore, vulnerable to being derailed by noisy data. In practice,this translates to a strong dependence of the optimization dynamics on the noise in the data, i.e., poor generalization performance. To remediate this problem, we propose a new optimization procedure: Rolling Ball Optimizer (RBO), that breaks this spatial locality by incorporating information from a larger region of the loss landscape in its updates. We achieve this by simulating the motion of a rigid sphere of finite radius rolling on the loss landscape, a straightforward generalization of Gradient Descent (GD) that simplifies into it in the infinitesimal limit. The radius serves as a hyperparameter that determines the scale at which RBO sees the loss landscape, allowing control over the granularity of its interaction therewith. We are motivated by the intuition that the large-scale geometry of the loss landscape is less data-specific than its fine-grained structure, and that it is easier to optimize. We support this intuition by proving that our algorithm has a smoothing effect on the loss function. Evaluation against SGD, SAM, and Entropy-SGD, on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrates promising results in terms of convergence speed, training accuracy, and generalization performance.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input data. While these attacks are well studied in unstructured domains such as images, their behaviour on tabular data remains underexplored due to mixed feature types and complex inter-feature dependencies. This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates adversarial attacks on tabular datasets with respect to both effectiveness and imperceptibility. We assess five white-box attack algorithms (FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, and C\&amp;W) across four representative models (LR, MLP, TabTransformer and FT-Transformer) using eleven datasets spanning finance, energy, and healthcare domains. The benchmark employs four quantitative imperceptibility metrics (proximity, sparsity, deviation, and sensitivity) to characterise perturbation realism. The analysis quantifies the trade-off between these two aspects and reveals consistent differences between attack types, with $\ell_\infty$-based attacks achieving higher success but lower subtlety, and $\ell_2$-based attacks offering more realistic perturbations. The benchmark findings offer actionable insights for designing more imperceptible adversarial attacks, advancing the understanding of adversarial vulnerability in tabular machine learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and complexity. Although recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design, current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain, lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis, and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models, encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows. Our data is released at this URL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM. We have released our model, training code, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in transformer interpretability, an understanding of the computational mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge. Many approaches interpret a network's hidden representations but remain agnostic about how those representations are generated. We address this by mapping LLM inference for a given input sequence to an equivalent and interpretable linear system which reconstructs the predicted output embedding with relative error below $10^{-13}$ at double floating-point precision, requiring no additional model training. We exploit a property of transformers wherein every operation (gated activations, attention, and normalization) can be expressed as $A(x) \cdot x$, where $A(x)$ represents an input-dependent linear transform and $x$ preserves the linear pathway. To expose this linear structure, we strategically detach components of the gradient computation with respect to an input sequence, freezing the $A(x)$ terms at their values computed during inference, such that the Jacobian yields an equivalent linear mapping. This detached Jacobian of the model reconstructs the output with one linear operator per input token, which is shown for Qwen 3, Gemma 3 and Llama 3, up to Qwen 3 14B. These linear representations demonstrate that LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where the singular vectors can be decoded to interpretable semantic concepts. The computation for each intermediate output also has a linear equivalent, and we examine how the linear representations of individual layers and their attention and multilayer perceptron modules build predictions, and use these as steering operators to insert semantic concepts into unrelated text. Despite their global nonlinearity, LLMs can be interpreted through equivalent linear representations that reveal low-dimensional semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios (e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). The key idea of MLorc is to compress and reconstruct the momentum of matrix parameters during training to reduce memory consumption. Compared to LoRA, MLorc avoids enforcing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and thus enables full-parameter learning. Compared to GaLore, MLorc directly compress the momentum rather than gradients, thereby better preserving the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning. We provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under mild assumptions. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning at small ranks (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem. Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth node matchings are often costly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable preference-aware discriminator. By leveraging preference signals over different node matchings derived from edit path lengths, the discriminator can guide the matching-based solver toward generating high-quality node matching without the need for ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

<title>Bridging Neural ODE and ResNet: A Formal Error Bound for Safety Verification</title>

Abstract: A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning model that is commonly described as a continuous-depth generalization of a residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.

Abstract: We study how data of higher quality can be leveraged to improve performance in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), aiming to understand its impact on DPO training dynamics. Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of DPO depend on the support and quality of the data-generating distribution. We first analyze how data and reference policy influence policy updates during gradient descent, and how a practical phenomenon known as likelihood displacement can interfere with the desired dynamics. We then design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy that preserves most of the beneficial properties of RLHF while avoiding likelihood displacement. Based on this model, we develop quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework in practice.

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI) and Conservative RPI (CRPI), variants of Policy Iteration (PI) and Conservative PI (CPI), that retain tabular guarantees under function approximation. RPI uses a novel Bellman-constrained optimization for policy evaluation. We show that RPI restores the textbook \textit{monotonicity} of value estimates and that these estimates provably \textit{lower-bound} the true return; moreover, their limit partially satisfies the \textit{unprojected} Bellman equation. CRPI shares RPI's evaluation, but updates policies conservatively by maximizing a new performance-difference \textit{lower bound} that explicitly accounts for function-approximation-induced errors. CRPI inherits RPI's guarantees and, crucially, admits per-step improvement bounds. In initial simulations, RPI and CRPI outperform PI and its variants. Our work addresses a foundational gap in RL: popular algorithms such as TRPO and PPO derive from tabular CPI yet are deployed with function approximation, where CPI's guarantees often fail-leading to divergence, oscillations, or convergence to suboptimal policies. By restoring PI/CPI-style guarantees for \textit{arbitrary} function classes, RPI and CRPI provide a principled basis for next-generation RL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer a scalable and efficient architecture for training large neural networks by activating only a subset of parameters ("experts") for each input. A learned router computes a distribution over these experts, and assigns input tokens to a small subset. However, without auxiliary balancing mechanisms, routers often converge to using only a few experts, severely limiting model capacity and degrading performance. Most current load balancing mechanisms encourage a distribution over experts that resembles a roughly uniform distribution of experts per token. During training, this can result in inconsistent routing behavior, resulting in the model spending its capacity to learn redundant knowledge. We address this by introducing a novel load balancing loss that preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Our experimental results show that applying our loss to the router results in 36% faster convergence and lower redundancy compared to a popular load balancing loss.

Abstract: Large language generative models increasingly interact with humans, while their falsified responses raise concerns. To mitigate this hallucination effect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation, provides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when uncertain about their answers. However, as selective generators interact under adversarial environments and receive partial feedback from users on selected generation (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods for selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently missing. To address this limitation, we propose an online learning algorithm for selective generation with partial feedback under an adaptive adversary. In particular, we re-purpose an adversarial bandit algorithm to design an online selective generation method with controllable false discovery rates (FDR), which measures the rate of hallucination. The key building blocks include a novel conversion lemma from regret of any bandit algorithm to the FDR, and the exploitation of a unique structure of selective generation to reuse partial feedback, which we call feedback unlocking. We empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm with partial feedback over diverse learning environments, demonstrating its ability to control the FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the ratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.

Abstract: Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers a versatile framework for generation across multiple data modalities. However, it remains unclear how its interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling (IS) becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient posterior sampler. For situations where IS fails, we investigate a novel strategy using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal sampling. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, interpretability, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Corp. hardware.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets, architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Large language models with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve efficiency and scalability, yet their routing mechanisms introduce safety alignment challenges insufficiently addressed by techniques developed for dense models. In this work, the MoE-specific safety risk of positional vulnerability-that safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules-is formalized and systematically analyzed. An analytical framework, SAFEx, is presented to robustly identify, characterize, and validate safety-critical experts via a stability-based expert selection procedure, and to decompose them into two functional groups: the Harmful Content Detection Group (HCDG), which specializes in identifying and recognizing harmful content within user inputs, and the Harmful Response Control Group (HRCG), which specializes in controlling and enforcing model behaviors to generate appropriate safety responses. Expert-level interventions are conducted to probe causality and to test mitigation. Targeted masking of SAFEx-selected experts reveals that safety behavior is highly concentrated. On Qwen3-30B-A3B, configured with 48 MoE-FFN layers and 128 experts per layer under top-8 routing (48x128=6,144 experts in total), disabling 12 selected experts reduces the refusal rate by 22%. In addition, lightweight adaptation is performed using LoRA under three configurations-the HRCG, the union of HCDG and HRCG, and all experts-and the resulting updates are composed through negative weight merging targeted at the HRCG, leading to improved refusal under adversarial prompts without full-model retraining. These results establish positional vulnerability as a distinct MoE-specific safety challenge and provide a practical, compute-efficient pathway for expert-level safety interventions within routed architectures.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift, multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges. A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss, can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal prediction approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two small open models ($~3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.58$ vs $0.45$ average accuracy) and outperforms the distillation approach ($0.58$ vs $0.56$ average accuracy) while using $81%$ less data.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

<title>The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and make it difficult to assess their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization, editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length. Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500 post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent models.

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion to a growing ecosystem of competing models. In this paper, we take a different perspective on model comparison: instead of relying on out-of-the-box performance via direct evaluation, we compare model potential by providing each model with identical benchmark-specific fine-tuning before evaluation. We call this approach train-before-test. Our primary contribution is a comprehensive empirical evaluation of model potential across 24 benchmarks and 61 models. First, we demonstrate that model potential rankings obtained through train-before-test exhibit remarkable consistency across all benchmarks. Whereas traditional rankings demonstrate little external validity under direct evaluation, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying train-before-test: model potential rankings transfer gracefully from one benchmark to another. Second, train-before-test restores the connection between perplexity and downstream task performance, lost under direct evaluation. Remarkably, even pre-finetuning perplexity of a base model predicts post-finetuning downstream performance, suggesting that ranking consistency reflects inherent model potential rather than fine-tuning artifacts. Finally, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one, indicating that model potential is dominated by one latent factor, uncovered by train-before-test. Our work supports the recommendation to make train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication should be scheduled over time to improve global generalization, including determining when and how frequently devices synchronize. Counterintuitive empirical results show that concentrating communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training remarkably improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, can significant improve the generalization performance of decentralized learning under serve high data heterogeneity. Our theoretical contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the globally merged model of decentralized SGD can match the convergence rate of parallel SGD. Technically, we reinterpret part of the discrepancy among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as constructive components essential for matching this rate. This work provides promising results that decentralized learning is able to generalize under high data heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering broad new avenues for model merging research. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement. Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56% in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore, through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by 14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model quantization is rapidly evolving. Though many papers report breakthrough results, they are often evaluated under different settings because a method typically contains multiple components. Analyzing connections among existing methods is important for deeper understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations under the same conditions for fair comparison. To our knowledge, such a fair and extensive investigation remains critically underexplored. To better understand connections, first, we decouple published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. The former is a preprocessing step that reduces outlier impact by flattening the data distribution; the latter offsets quantization errors to improve performance. Second, we evaluate and analyze the impact of different settings, including granularity and symmetry. Third, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats and their performance. Our experiments first demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best pre-quantization performance, and that combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ can occasionally outperform GPTQ alone for error mitigation. Second, finer granularity improves performance but increases storage overhead. Third, we find that scaling-factor format and precision greatly affect FP4 performance, and that rotation-based strategies effective for INT4 offer limited gains for MXFP4 and NVFP4, motivating further study.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. To address these issues, we propose CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework featuring (1) two novel components for handling data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity size and a multi-task discriminator that enhances generator training through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation - and (2) the GAN framework's native one-step generator, enable 30x-2000x faster inference than CCDM. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 256x256 resolution) across eleven challenging settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

<title>Training Long-Context, Multi-Turn Software Engineering Agents with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Research on applications of reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn Markov decision processes (MDPs), this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Our methodology begins with rejection fine-tuning (RFT) using execution feedback to train a policy to follow instructions and formatting effectively, followed by a synchronous RL pipeline using DAPO for iterative improvement. Applying this pipeline to Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, we increase its Pass@1 on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from 11% to 39%, substantially improving upon the 20% RFT baseline. On the May and June splits of SWE-rebench, the resulting agent achieves Pass@1 of 35% and 31% respectively, competitive with even larger models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 or Qwen3-235B-A22B, demonstrating that our methodology offers a practical approach for training capable agents for multi-turn interactive tasks using open-weight models.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks, relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete, difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data. However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased robustness-to-noise.

Abstract: Defending backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client data distributions encounters limitations balancing effectiveness and privacy-preserving, while most existing methods highly rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset. In this paper, we propose an FL backdoor defense framework, named CLIP-Fed, that utilizes the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. Our scheme overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness by integrating pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, so that class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples are ensured and the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels is eliminated. In order to balance privacy-preserving and coverage enhancement of the dataset against diverse triggers, we further construct and augment the server dataset via using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Comparing to other existing methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in Attack Success Rate, {\em i.e.}, 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average Main Task Accuracy by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIP-Fed.

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data. The code can be found at https://github.com/ShuqiZi1/S2G-Net.

Abstract: Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The development of self-supervised graph pre-training methods is a crucial ingredient in recent efforts to design robust graph foundation models (GFMs). Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks. Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score -- allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL, a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity, which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Abstract: We propose VL Norm (Variance-reduced Length-dependent Normalization), a simple yet effective loss aggregation method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased estimator. Our proposed VL Norm not only provides an unbiased estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in theory. Besides, VL Norm is easy to implement with less than 10 lines of code change. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. When integrated into the state-of-the-art RL algorithm DAPO, it achieves up to 2.67x faster convergence on the CountDown task. Our code is public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however, methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called "fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength, including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset.

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large. Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across model sizes and evaluation datasets, with the largest gains on the Qwen3-8B-Base model.

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks -- drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from "aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage, plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds \emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous (Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows that dynamic projection maintains the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based Transformer architectures, we propose the Iterative Implicit Euler Transformer (IIET), which simplifies high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we introduce Iteration Influence-Aware Distillation (IIAD). Through a flexible threshold, IIAD allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET, significantly cuts inference overhead by 55% while retaining 99.4% of the original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an average performance gain exceeding 1.6% over vanilla Transformer with comparable speed.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

<title>Specialization after Generalization: Towards Understanding Test-Time Training in Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware. Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1 accuracy drop.

<title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

<title>Vicinity-Guided Discriminative Latent Diffusion for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

<title>Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost, particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research, aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models. Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more suitable for real-world use cases.

Abstract: We propose PDE-Transformer, a novel sequence modeling paradigm that casts the forward pass of a Transformer as the numerical discretization of a continuous reaction-diffusion system derived from a variational energy functional. In our framework, token embeddings evolve under a partial differential equation whose nonlocal integral term models self-attention, local reaction term models feed-forward layers, diffusion term encodes positional smoothing, and a stability control term corresponds to layer normalization. From this unifying perspective, we design an Adaptive PDE Diffusion Layer-an efficient, learnable finite-difference stencil that enforces local smoothness in feature space with linear time complexity and complements self-attention's global routing. Through a systematic theoretical analysis based on four pillars:stability, diffusion geometry, multi-scale dynamics, and component coupling, we derive principled guidelines for integrating the PDE layer at seven candidate points in the Transformer. Empirically, on the Long Range Arena benchmark, placing the layer immediately after embedding yields a 4.1 pp average accuracy gain over a strong baseline, and an adaptive multi-scale variant delivers further improvements. Our work thus offers a principled, lightweight mechanism to bolster long-range dependency modeling by harmonizing continuous PDE smoothing with discrete self-attention.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Abstract: Intraoperative pathology is pivotal to precision surgery, yet its clinical impact is constrained by diagnostic complexity and the limited availability of high-quality frozen-section data. While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.

Abstract: We present Exact Causal Attention (ECA), a Strassen-style algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. ECA improves a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all matrix multiplication operations in the forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. ECA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search. We note that ECA cannot accelerate fused kernels such as FlashAttention on GPU. This is because ECA requires materialization of large intermediate expressions in the memory, while FlashAttention does not. However, it provides an alternative approach for compute-bound applications and can potentially be useful in scenarios with FLOPs considerations.

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Abstract: Many leading classification algorithms output a classifier that is a weighted average of kernel evaluations. Optimizing these weights is a nontrivial problem that still attracts much research effort. Furthermore, explaining these methods to the uninitiated is a difficult task. Letting all the weights be equal leads to a conceptually simpler classification rule, one that requires little effort to motivate or explain, the mean. Here we explore the consistency, robustness and sparsification of this simple classification rule.

Abstract: A key challenge in the field of reinforcement learning is to develop agents that behave cautiously in novel situations. It is generally impossible to anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior would best avoid bad outcomes. An agent that can learn to be cautious would overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly non-obvious, as well as an algorithm to demonstrate that it is possible for a system to learn to be cautious. The essential features of our algorithm are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy. Specifically, we construct robust policies with a k-of-N counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) subroutine given learned reward function uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble. These policies exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/montaserFath/Learning-to-be-Cautious

Abstract: In this work, we build upon our previous publication and use diffusion-based generative models for speech enhancement. We present a detailed overview of the diffusion process that is based on a stochastic differential equation and delve into an extensive theoretical examination of its implications. Opposed to usual conditional generation tasks, we do not start the reverse process from pure Gaussian noise but from a mixture of noisy speech and Gaussian noise. This matches our forward process which moves from clean speech to noisy speech by including a drift term. We show that this procedure enables using only 30 diffusion steps to generate high-quality clean speech estimates. By adapting the network architecture, we are able to significantly improve the speech enhancement performance, indicating that the network, rather than the formalism, was the main limitation of our original approach. In an extensive cross-dataset evaluation, we show that the improved method can compete with recent discriminative models and achieves better generalization when evaluating on a different corpus than used for training. We complement the results with an instrumental evaluation using real-world noisy recordings and a listening experiment, in which our proposed method is rated best. Examining different sampler configurations for solving the reverse process allows us to balance the performance and computational speed of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is also suitable for dereverberation and thus not limited to additive background noise removal. Code and audio examples are available online, see https://github.com/sp-uhh/sgmse.

Abstract: Text-based machine learning models are vulnerable to an emerging class of Unicode-based adversarial examples capable of tricking a model into misreading text with potentially disastrous effects. The primary existing defense against these attacks is to preprocess potentially malicious text inputs using optical character recognition (OCR). In theory, OCR models will ignore any malicious Unicode characters and will extract the visually correct input to be fed to the model. In this work, we show that these visual defenses fail to prevent this type of attack. We use a genetic algorithm to generate visual adversarial examples (i.e., OCR outputs) in a black-box setting, demonstrating a highly effective novel attack that substantially reduces the accuracy of OCR and other visual models. Specifically, we use the Unicode functionality of combining characters (e.g., \~n which combines the characters n and ~) to manipulate text inputs so that small visual perturbations appear when the text is displayed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks in the real world by creating adversarial examples against production models published by Meta, Microsoft, IBM, and Google. We additionally conduct a user study to establish that the model-fooling adversarial examples do not affect human comprehension of the text, showing that language models are uniquely vulnerable to this type of text attack.

Abstract: Camouflaged objects that blend into natural scenes pose significant challenges for deep-learning models to detect and synthesize. While camouflaged object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.

Abstract: Predicting crowd intentions and trajectories is critical for a range of real-world applications, involving social robotics and autonomous driving. Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.

Abstract: We introduce an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based deep generative method for learning conditional distributions, named Conditional F\"ollmer Flow. Starting from a standard Gaussian distribution, the proposed flow could approximate the target conditional distribution very well when the time is close to 1. For effective implementation, we discretize the flow with Euler's method where we estimate the velocity field nonparametrically using a deep neural network. Furthermore, we also establish the convergence result for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the distribution of the learned samples and the target conditional distribution, providing the first comprehensive end-to-end error analysis for conditional distribution learning via ODE flow. Our numerical experiments showcase its effectiveness across a range of scenarios, from standard nonparametric conditional density estimation problems to more intricate challenges involving image data, illustrating its superiority over various existing conditional density estimation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, biomedical training has not been systematically evaluated on medical tasks. This study investigates the effect of biomedical training in the context of six practical medical tasks evaluating $25$ models. In contrast to previous evaluations, our results reveal a performance decline in nine out of twelve biomedical models after fine-tuning, particularly on tasks involving hallucinations, ICD10 coding, and instruction adherence. General-domain models like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct outperformed their biomedical counterparts, indicating a trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general medical task performance. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE to support further research in this critical area.

<title>Online Auction Design Using Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification with Applications to E-Commerce</title>

Abstract: Online auction is a cornerstone of e-commerce, and a key challenge is designing incentive-compatible mechanisms that maximize expected revenue. Existing approaches often assume known bidder value distributions and fixed sets of bidders and items, but these assumptions rarely hold in real-world settings where bidder values are unknown, and the number of future participants is uncertain. In this paper, we introduce the Conformal Online Auction Design (COAD), a novel mechanism that maximizes revenue by quantifying uncertainty in bidder values without relying on known distributions. COAD incorporates both bidder and item features, using historical data to design an incentive-compatible mechanism for online auctions. Unlike traditional methods, COAD leverages distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques and integrates machine learning methods, such as random forests, kernel methods, and deep neural networks, to predict bidder values while ensuring revenue guarantees. Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices, based on the lower confidence bounds of bidder valuations, contrasting with the single reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of COAD through an application to real-world eBay auction data. Theoretical results and extensive simulation studies further validate the properties of our approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

<title>Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

Abstract: A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization. We illustrate the scope of the results on applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling, highlighting how smoothing enables both tractable training and controlled generalization.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning Bayesian networks from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. We consider an $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for this problem which is known to have favorable statistical properties but is computationally challenging to solve, especially for medium-sized Bayesian networks. We propose a new coordinate descent algorithm to approximate this estimator and prove several remarkable properties of our procedure: the algorithm converges to a coordinate-wise minimum, and despite the non-convexity of the loss function, as the sample size tends to infinity, the objective value of the coordinate descent solution converges to the optimal objective value of the $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. Finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees are also established. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first coordinate descent procedure endowed with optimality and statistical guarantees in the context of learning Bayesian networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our coordinate descent method can obtain near-optimal solutions while being scalable.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to inconsistency, bias, and the absence of transparent decision criteria in automated judging. We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping. Ablations and qualitative analyses isolate the contributions of debate, aggregation, and anonymity. Together, these results establish D3 as a principled, practical recipe for reliable, interpretable, and cost-aware LLM evaluation.

arXiv:2410.12201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a Synthetics, Aggregation, and Test inversion (SAT) approach for merging diverse and potentially dependent uncertainty sets into a single unified set. The procedure is data-light, relying only on initial sets and their nominal levels, and it flexibly adapts to user-specified input sets with possibly varying coverage guarantees. SAT is motivated by the challenge of integrating uncertainty sets when only the initial sets and their control levels are available-for example, when merging confidence sets from distributed sites under communication constraints or combining conformal prediction sets generated by different algorithms or data splits. To address this, SAT constructs and aggregates novel synthetic test statistics, and then derive merged sets through test inversion. Our method leverages the duality between set estimation and hypothesis testing, ensuring reliable coverage in dependent scenarios. A key theoretical contribution is a rigorous analysis of SAT's properties, including its admissibility in the context of deterministic set merging. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results confirm the method's finite-sample coverage validity and desirable set sizes.

Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach. Code is available at https://github.com/zqhang/FairDD.

Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising approach for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) of visual representations. However, the out-of-the-box performance of MIMs is typically inferior to competing approaches. Most users cannot afford fine-tuning due to the need for large amounts of data, high GPU consumption, and specialized user knowledge. Therefore, the practical use of MIM representations is limited. In this paper we ask what is the reason for the poor out-of-the-box performance of MIMs. Is it due to weaker features produced by MIM models, or is it due to suboptimal usage? Through detailed analysis, we show that attention in MIMs is spread almost uniformly over many patches, leading to ineffective aggregation by the [cls] token. Based on this insight, we propose Selective Aggregation to better capture the rich semantic information retained in patch tokens, which significantly improves the out-of-the-box performance of MIM.

Abstract: We study the mixing time of the projected Langevin algorithm (LA) and the privacy curve of noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), beyond nonexpansive iterations. Specifically, we derive new mixing time bounds for the projected LA which are, in some important cases, dimension-free and poly-logarithmic on the accuracy, closely matching the existing results in the smooth convex case. Additionally, we establish new upper bounds for the privacy curve of the subsampled noisy SGD algorithm. These bounds show a crucial dependency on the regularity of gradients, and are useful for a wide range of convex losses beyond the smooth case. Our analysis relies on a suitable extension of the Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) framework (Feldman et al., 2018; Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, 2023) to noisy iterations whose gradient map is not necessarily nonexpansive. This extension is achieved by designing an optimization problem which accounts for the best possible R\'enyi divergence bound obtained by an application of PABI, where the tractability of the problem is crucially related to the modulus of continuity of the associated gradient mapping. We show that, in several interesting cases -- namely the nonsmooth convex, weakly smooth and (strongly) dissipative -- such optimization problem can be solved exactly and explicitly, yielding the tightest possible PABI-based bounds.

Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-pi achieves an average success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action space by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos.

Abstract: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert new concepts or objects and generate them in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on comparatively expensive test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image datasets without multi-image supervision, which can limit image quality. We propose a simple approach to address these challenges. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. Using this dataset, we train an encoder-based model that incorporates fine-grained visual details from reference images via a shared attention mechanism. Finally, we propose an inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors to mitigate overexposure issues in sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we show that our encoder-based model, trained on SynCD, and with the proposed inference algorithm, improves upon existing encoder-based methods on standard customization benchmarks.

<title>Any-stepsize Gradient Descent for Separable Data under Fenchel-Young Losses</title>

Abstract: The gradient descent (GD) has been one of the most common optimizer in machine learning. In particular, the loss landscape of a neural network is typically sharpened during the initial phase of training, making the training dynamics hover on the edge of stability. This is beyond our standard understanding of GD convergence in the stable regime where arbitrarily chosen stepsize is sufficiently smaller than the edge of stability. Recently, Wu et al. (COLT2024) have showed that GD converges with arbitrary stepsize under linearly separable logistic regression. Although their analysis hinges on the self-bounding property of the logistic loss, which seems to be a cornerstone to establish a modified descent lemma, our pilot study shows that other loss functions without the self-bounding property can make GD converge with arbitrary stepsize. To further understand what property of a loss function matters in GD, we aim to show arbitrary-stepsize GD convergence for a general loss function based on the framework of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. We essentially leverage the classical perceptron argument to derive the convergence rate for achieving $\epsilon$-optimal loss, which is possible for a majority of Fenchel--Young losses. Among typical loss functions, the Tsallis entropy achieves the GD convergence rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and the R{\'e}nyi entropy achieves the far better rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/3})$. We argue that these better rate is possible because of \emph{separation margin} of loss functions, instead of the self-bounding property.

<title>Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 1,419,047 comments posted on 3,161 YouTube news videos of major US cable news outlets, we analyze how users engage with LGBTQ+ news content. Our analyses focus both on positive and negative content. In particular, we construct a fine-grained hope speech classifier that detects positive (hope speech), negative, neutral, and irrelevant content. Second, in consultation with a public health expert specializing on LGBTQ+ health, we conduct an annotation study with a balanced and diverse political representation and release a dataset of 3,750 instances with fine-grained labels and detailed annotator demographic information. Finally, beyond providing a vital resource for the LGBTQ+ community, our annotation study and subsequent in-the-wild assessments reveal (1) strong association between rater political beliefs and how they rate content relevant to a marginalized community; (2) models trained on individual political beliefs exhibit considerable in-the-wild disagreement; and (3) zero-shot large language models (LLMs) align more with liberal raters.

Abstract: Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with small objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light switch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a closed-loop framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle such precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM uses state-of-the-art vision foundation models to generate 3D targets for visual servoing to enable diverse tasks in novel environments. Naively doing so fails because of occlusion by the end-effector. SVM mitigates this using vision models that out-paint the end-effector, thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We demonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object detectors can serve as a drop-in module for SVM to seek semantic targets (e.g. knobs) and point tracking methods can help SVM reliably pursue interaction sites indicated by user clicks. We conduct a large-scale evaluation spanning experiments in 10 novel environments across 6 buildings including 72 different object instances. SVM obtains a 71% zero-shot success rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real world, outperforming an open-loop control method by an absolute 42% and an imitation learning baseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations also by an absolute success rate of 50%.

<title>Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective</title>

arXiv:2502.17262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

Abstract: Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is critical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.

<title>Disentangling Feature Structure: A Mathematically Provable Two-Stage Training Dynamics in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers may exhibit two-stage training dynamics during the real-world training process. For instance, when training GPT-2 on the Counterfact dataset, the answers progress from syntactically incorrect to syntactically correct to semantically correct. However, existing theoretical analyses hardly account for this feature-level two-stage phenomenon, which originates from the disentangled two-type features like syntax and semantics. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how the two-stage training dynamics potentially occur in transformers. Specifically, we analyze the feature learning dynamics induced by the aforementioned disentangled two-type feature structure, grounding our analysis in a simplified yet illustrative setting that comprises a normalized ReLU self-attention layer and structured data. Such disentanglement of feature structure is general in practice, e.g., natural languages contain syntax and semantics, and proteins contain primary and secondary structures. To our best knowledge, this is the first rigorous result regarding a feature-level two-stage optimization process in transformers. Additionally, a corollary indicates that such a two-stage process is closely related to the spectral properties of the attention weights, which accords well with our empirical findings.

<title>Near-Optimal Real-Time Personalization with Simple Transformers</title>

Abstract: Real-time personalization has advanced significantly in recent years, with platforms utilizing machine learning models to predict user preferences based on rich behavioral data on each individual user. Traditional approaches usually rely on embedding-based machine learning models to capture user preferences, and then reduce the final optimization task to nearest-neighbors, which can be performed extremely fast. However, these models struggle to capture complex user behaviors, which are essential for making accurate recommendations. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are known for their practical ability to model sequential behaviors, and hence have been intensively used in personalization recently to overcome these limitations. However, optimizing recommendations under transformer-based models is challenging due to their complicated architectures. In this paper, we address this challenge by considering a specific class of transformers, showing its ability to represent complex user preferences, and developing efficient algorithms for real-time personalization.
  We focus on a particular set of transformers, called simple transformers, which contain a single self-attention layer. We show that simple transformers are capable of capturing complex user preferences. We then develop an algorithm that enables fast optimization of recommendation tasks based on simple transformers. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in sub-linear time. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an empirical study on datasets from Spotify and Trivago. Our experiment results show that (1) simple transformers can model/predict user preferences substantially more accurately than non-transformer models and nearly as accurately as more complex transformers, and (2) our algorithm completes simple-transformer-based recommendation tasks quickly and effectively.

Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.

Abstract: We propose L2T, an advancement of visual instruction tuning (VIT). While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments remains a major challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that although the performance of pre-trained models suffers from mismatch between the training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher uncertainty in environments where there is more mismatch. Additionally, in the presence of environmental mismatch, spurious peaks can appear in the output of classification-based localization approaches, which inspires us to define and use a method to quantify the "implied uncertainty" based on the number of model output peaks. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the test samples into sets with more certain and less certain samples, and implement a method to adapt the model to new environments by using the certain samples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the model. Thus, using this efficient method for model uncertainty quantification, we showcase an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen underwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data from the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is enhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal energy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as well as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean noise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction accuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater acoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.

Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In different alignment scenarios, such as safety, confidence, and general preference alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but play a central role in transferring human preferences. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and reference answers as a supplementary reward function for alignment. When unary reference answers are available, such similarity-based rewards can circumvent the need for binary preference data and explicit reward modeling. We introduce \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm that does not rely on reward or reference models. RefAlign utilizes language generation evaluation metrics, such as BERTScore, between sampled generations and reference answers as surrogate rewards. Beyond general preference optimization, RefAlign can be naturally extended to diverse scenarios, including safety and confidence alignment, by combining similarity-based rewards with task-specific objectives. Across multiple scenarios, RefAlign achieves performance comparable to prior alignment methods while operating without binary preference data or reward models. The code is available at https://github.com/mzhaoshuai/RefAlign.

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Abstract: WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference, where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2) response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR. Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

<title>One-Stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer: Score-Based Surrogates with Theoretical Guarantees</title>

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

<title>J1: Incentivizing Thinking in LLM-as-a-Judge via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, making powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models a core solution. The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.

<title>Incentivize Contribution and Learn Parameters Too: Federated Learning with Strategic Data Owners</title>

Abstract: Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution in a truthful manner, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. We also ensure that agents are incentivized to truthfully reveal information in the intermediate stages of the algorithm. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism that enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees and better model performance for all agents.

<title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials ("fallen angels").

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even without adversarial prompts.

<title>Saten: Sparse Augmented Tensor Networks for Post-Training Compression of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training) remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks (Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

arXiv:2505.15692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing model reasoning. However, existing RL methods like GRPO often rely on unstructured self-sampling to fit scalar rewards, often producing inefficient rollouts that fail to capture transferable problem-solving strategies. To address these limitations, we propose **TemplateRL**, a structured template-guided RL framework that augments policy optimization with explicit template guidance. Our approach first constructs a problem-solving template library via MCTS on a small seed set, then seamlessly integrates this high-level structured guidance into RL training. By guiding rollout generation to align with proven template structures, TemplateRL significantly improves high-quality trajectory hit rates while reducing ineffective exploration. This structure-guided design steers the policy toward validated strategic patterns, stabilizing training dynamics, and enhancing RL sampling efficiency. Notably, the explicit template library is interpretable, editable, and supports online updates-enabling continuous updates during both training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemplateRL outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME and 41% on AMC, with superior stability on weak models and remarkable cross-domain generalization, highlighting its potential for broader tasks.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight finetuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate semi-supervised approaches that combine limited annotated data with self-supervised learning from users' publications. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 with contextual prompting by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

<title>TRIM: Achieving Extreme Sparsity with Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven Pruning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM

<title>Task-Optimized Convolutional Recurrent Networks Align with Tactile Processing in the Rodent Brain</title>

Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

arXiv:2505.23305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our project page: https://yoongi43.github.io/MGELDM_Samples/.

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1. We sample new antibody variants with the top-performing models, rank them by the structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex, and assess them with in vitro ELISA binding assays. Our findings show that structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

<title>From Static to Adaptive Defense: Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Moving Target Defense Against DoS Attacks in UAV Swarm Networks</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of UAVs has enabled a wide range of mission-critical applications and is becoming a cornerstone of low-altitude networks, supporting smart cities, emergency response, and more. However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

<title>When Less Is More: Binary Feedback Can Outperform Ordinal Comparisons in Ranking Recovery</title>

Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.

<title>Investigating VLM Hallucination from a Cognitive Psychology Perspective: A First Step Toward Interpretation with Intriguing Observations</title>

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, and may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' cognitive biases that lead to hallucinations, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: appeal to authority. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-rllab/MoPPS.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full RaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation have driven progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of unifying GUI navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically, NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks using a single formulation. (ii) employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data to improve generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation studies further demonstrate the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data mixing strategy, and reward design.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of scientific knowledge presents a grand challenge: transforming this vast repository of information into an active engine for discovery, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare. Current AI agents, however, are constrained by static, predefined strategies, limiting their ability to navigate the complex, evolving ecosystem of scientific research. This paper introduces HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, structured knowledge base, enabling it to learn not just how to use tools, but how to strategize. To anchor our research and provide a community resource, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex health data analysis tasks systematically derived from peer-reviewed scientific literature. Our experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work offers a new paradigm for intelligent systems that can learn to operationalize the procedural knowledge embedded in scientific content, marking a critical step toward more autonomous and effective AI for healthcare scientific discovery.

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV inspection of confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation ducts, demands robust navigation policies where collisions are unacceptable. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful paradigm for developing such policies, it presents a critical trade-off between on-policy and off-policy algorithms. Off-policy methods promise high sample efficiency, a vital trait for minimizing costly and unsafe real-world fine-tuning. In contrast, on-policy methods often exhibit greater training stability, which is essential for reliable convergence in hazard-dense environments. This paper directly investigates this trade-off by comparing a leading on-policy algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), against an off-policy counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), for precision flight in procedurally generated ducts within a high-fidelity simulator. Our results show that PPO consistently learned a stable, collision-free policy that completed the entire course. In contrast, SAC failed to find a complete solution, converging to a suboptimal policy that navigated only the initial segments before failure. This work provides evidence that for high-precision, safety-critical navigation tasks, the reliable convergence of a well-established on-policy method can be more decisive than the nominal sample efficiency of an off-policy algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, with a focus on improving precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs in training robust object detection models for complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: Recent advance in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), one state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance boost while maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel implementation of NSA forces a loop order that is only efficient with a relatively large number of query heads in each Grouped Query Attention (GQA) group, whereas existing LLMs widely adopt much smaller number of query heads in each GQA group -- such an inconsistency significantly limits the applicability of this sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention (FSA), an alternative kernel implementation that enables efficient NSA computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller number of heads in each GQA group on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5x and on average 1.6x kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25x and 1.09x on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36x and 1.11x on average for prefill-phase speedup in LLM generative inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system executed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations, with on-orbit operation aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. On-orbit validation aboard the ISS initially faced challenges due to inference latency misaligned with the rapid thermal cycles of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Synchronization with the orbit length successfully surpassed the baseline with reduced violations, extended episode durations, and improved CPU utilization. These findings demonstrate the potential for scalable agentic supervision architectures in future autonomous spacecraft.

Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been demonstrated as an effective method for safety-critical control of autonomous systems. Although CBFs are simple to deploy, their design remains challenging, motivating the development of learning-based approaches. Yet, issues such as suboptimal safe sets, applicability in partially observable environments, and lack of rigorous safety guarantees persist. In this work, we propose observation-conditioned neural CBFs based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which approximately recover the maximal safe sets. We exploit certain mathematical properties of the HJ value function, ensuring that the predicted safe set never intersects with the observed failure set. Moreover, we leverage a hypernetwork-based architecture that is particularly suitable for the design of observation-conditioned safety filters. The proposed method is examined both in simulation and hardware experiments for a ground robot and a quadcopter. The results show improved success rates and generalization to out-of-domain environments compared to the baselines.

Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.

<title>Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning: Dual-Fact Alignment for Long-Form Factuality</title>

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads, inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer. These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip) connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is $\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and other hypothesis testing methodologies.

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers' tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks under physical limits.

Abstract: Modern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.

<title>Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study</title>

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

<title>Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding</title>

arXiv:2510.05014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First, we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869 for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content standards.}

Summary: 
The paper introduces PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that aims to improve serving efficiency by approximating SJF scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS is integrated into vLLM and focuses on making impactful scheduling decisions based on response length, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that PARS significantly enhances performance, especially for reasoning workloads. The design of PARS generalizes well across different LLMs, enabling effective scheduling even when trained on other models. <div>

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.

Summary:
In this study, the authors address the issue of scalability of Transformers due to their quadratic computational complexity. They highlight the limitation of existing post-training linearization methods, which often rely too heavily on sliding-window softmax and neglect genuine linear attention adoption. The authors propose three innovative solutions to ensure balanced component usage and maintain computational efficiency. First, they suggest hybridizing linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax during inference. Secondly, they introduce HedgeCATs, which combine attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning. Lastly, they present Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD) to prevent component collapse by stochastically suppressing the softmax branch during training. These methods aim to recover base model performance while ensuring the genuine adoption of linear attention, thereby restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases, prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

<div> Energy-Driven Steering, large language models, safety alignment, false refusal rates, Energy-Based Model <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a framework that enhances safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) by reducing false refusals without affecting performance. EDS utilizes an external Energy-Based Model (EBM) during inference to steer LLMs away from undesirable states and towards desired responses in real-time. This approach effectively lowers false refusal rates while maintaining safety performance. Through dynamic intervention, EDS improves compliance on benchmarks like ORB-H from 57.3% to 82.6%. By decoupling behavioral control from core model knowledge, EDS offers a flexible solution with minimal computational overhead. Overall, the proposed framework presents a successful paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge: current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference, EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

<div> Large language models, such as RAG, display changes in outputs due to reorderings, eroded invariances from fine-tuning, and path-dependent responses to prompts. This can lead to failures in maintaining intended invariances, breaking continuous integration, and forcing trade-offs between safety and speed. The WILSON diagnostic suite addresses these issues by flagging reorder risks through a curvature map and activation-level commutators, enabling actions to guard against order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and long contexts, and regulate fusions or reorders in deployment. WILSON provides cheap, model-agnostic signals for standard Transformers, facilitating anticipatory measures and safe optimizations without altering model architecture or training.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Large language models like RAG show changes in outputs due to reorderings, eroded invariances from fine-tuning, and path-dependent responses to prompts. The WILSON diagnostic suite addresses these issues by flagging reorder risks through a curvature map and activation-level commutators. This enables actions to guard against order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and long contexts, and regulate fusions or reorders in deployment. WILSON provides cheap, model-agnostic signals for standard Transformers, facilitating anticipatory measures and safe optimizations without altering model architecture or training. <div>
arXiv:2510.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute, model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short, WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or training.

RareNet is a Graph Neural Network designed to address challenges in diagnosing rare genetic diseases. It utilizes patient phenotypic data to predict the most likely causative gene and generate focused patient subgraphs for further clinical investigation. This approach overcomes limitations such as lack of patient data and inaccessible full genome sequencing, offering a valuable tool for diagnosing rare diseases. RareNet can function independently or complement other gene prioritization methods, improving overall performance. It democratizes access to advanced genetic analysis by only requiring phenotypic data, making it particularly beneficial for underserved populations with limited genomic infrastructure. Through evaluation on biomedical datasets, RareNet demonstrates competitive gene prediction accuracy and enhances performance when integrated with existing frameworks. This technology has the potential to streamline diagnostic processes, reduce delays in treatment, and provide explainable insights in rare disease diagnostics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Summary: 
The study focuses on addressing distribution shifts in time series forecasting caused by non-stationarity, which can impact model performance. Existing instance normalization techniques do not consider shifts within individual instances, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle inner-instance distribution shifts, the authors propose two new point-level methods: Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD adjusts internal distribution parameters for input and output at different time steps, while LCD employs neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. The performance of these methods is evaluated across public benchmarks with various backbone models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm. The proposed approaches show promise in improving forecasting accuracy by addressing distribution shifts at a finer level.

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time, negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods: Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm through comparative experiments.

Summary:
The study introduces Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (LeFCert) as a provably robust few-shot classifier tailored for Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs). It integrates textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism and proposes a twofold trimmed mean prototype to achieve provable robustness. LeFCert also offers variants like LeFCert-L and LeFCert-C for enhanced performance under realistic attack scenarios. Experiments show that LeFCert outperforms existing baselines in terms of clean and certified accuracy. Despite its robustness mechanisms, LeFCert remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2510.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP, have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.

Summary:
This study focuses on the evaluation of complex, high-dimensional data visualizations using two-dimensional scatter plots. Researchers commonly rely on quality metrics such as normalized stress and KL divergence to assess the accuracy of these visualizations. However, these metrics are sensitive to uniform scaling, which can lead to misleading results. The authors investigate the impact of scaling on these metrics both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating significant changes in values. They propose a simple technique to make the metrics scale-invariant, which accurately reflects the expected behavior in a benchmark study. By addressing the issue of scale sensitivity, researchers can improve the evaluation of dimension reduction techniques and ensure more reliable interpretations of visualized data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique, is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.

This approach dynamically assigns time series instances to dedicated predictors based on classification, allowing for supervised channel design. Theoretical analysis of different channel settings is provided to understand the expected risks. Additionally, a new trend-seasonal decomposition architecture is proposed, incorporating a decoupling-linear mapping-recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear projections for seasonal components.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI). CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification, enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Summary: <br />
Genomic Selection (GS) is a method that uses whole-genome information to predict crop traits and accelerate breeding processes. Traditional GS approaches face challenges in accurately predicting complex traits and handling large datasets. In this study, a new deep learning model called DPCformer was introduced, which combines convolutional neural networks with a self-attention mechanism to model genotype-phenotype relationships. DPCformer was applied to 13 traits in five different crops, showing superior performance compared to existing methods. Significant improvements in prediction accuracy were observed for traits such as days to tasseling and plant height in maize, fiber traits in cotton, and yield correlation in chickpea. The model also demonstrated robustness in small-sample scenarios and enhanced interpretability, making it a valuable tool for precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges. <div>

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships. We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato, rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by 16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

The article explores the challenges of inference costs in diffusion transformers and introduces a solution called Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa). Frequency analysis reveals that different frequency bands in features exhibit varying dynamics across timesteps. Low-frequency components are reused based on similarity, while a second-order Hermite interpolator predicts high-frequency components for continuity. The use of Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of features in all layers reduces memory usage by 99%.

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps. Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images, exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing. Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a novel approach, LENS, to enhance reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) by effectively utilizing negative groups without additional supervision. By incorporating a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses into the value function, LENS transforms previously uninformative negative groups into valuable gradient updates. The modified approach outperforms the baseline GRPO method on the MATH benchmark using large language models, showing significant improvements on challenging tasks. This method not only boosts efficiency but also enhances overall performance in RLVR tasks. The findings offer a principled and practical solution for leveraging negative groups in reinforcement learning, showcasing the potential for improved computational efficiency and task performance. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses, imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as \textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples (\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups, improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

<div> Channel equalization, in-context learning, non-stationary, attention mechanisms, adaptive signal processing <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper explores the use of in-context learning (ICL) for time-varying channel equalization, a non-stationary problem. Existing ICL-based equalizers are typically designed for static channels within a context window. The research investigates the adaptability of ICL in dynamic environments and introduces efficient attention mechanisms inspired by adaptive signal processing algorithms. Variants such as those derived from the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation, and multi-step gradient updates are proposed to enhance adaptability and performance in non-stationary tasks. Experimental results show promising results for non-stationary MIMO equalization, indicating the potential for ICL in dynamic settings. The study provides insights for developing next-generation wireless models with improved adaptability and robustness. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks, leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs. For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger adaptability and robustness.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning method that treats each instance in a dataset as a separate class. By creating two different views of each instance through stochastic transformations, the model is encouraged to learn representations that are invariant to the underlying object. This approach allows the model to learn useful features without the need for manual labeling, making it an efficient and effective way to train machine learning models. The use of stochastic transformations helps the model generalize well to new, unseen data, while the concept of treating instances as distinct classes allows for a more nuanced understanding of the data. Overall, instance discrimination is a valuable technique for improving the representation learning process in machine learning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes. This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these views.

Summary: 
Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) addresses the gap in ensuring counterfactual fairness in prediction sets, compared to point predictors. By symmetrizing conformity scores across protected-attribute interventions, CF-CP produces fair prediction sets while maintaining marginal coverage. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate CF-CP's effectiveness in achieving counterfactual fairness and meeting coverage rate targets with minimal increase in prediction set size. This approach offers a training-free method for fair uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction techniques.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction (CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Summary:<br />
- This research provides a theoretical foundation for controlling large language models by modifying their internal states using weight vectors and weight matrices.
- Techniques such as steering vectors derived from contrastive prompts are explained through the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
- The influence of prompts can be mapped to implicit weight updates in deep transformers.
- Information from user prompts is internally represented and composed through weight vectors and matrices.
- A method for condensing prompt information into reusable weight updates is derived, providing a computationally-grounded way to transmute textual input. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques, while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture. Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct, computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable weight updates.

Clustering SHAP values can provide insights into the data by grouping samples with similar prediction pathways. The article showcases this methodology through a simulated experiment and a case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the ADNI database. Additionally, it introduces a novel generalization of the waterfall plot for multi-classification. In conclusion, the article emphasizes the significance of understanding how different samples arrive at the same prediction to enhance the trustworthiness and applicability of AI models in high-stakes situations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods, however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

It introduces a surrogate-based explanation methodology using a LightGBM model to mimic AutoGluon's forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature attributions.

Higher spectral predictability correlates with improved forecast accuracy and fidelity between the surrogate and original model. Forecasts and explanations can be filtered and calibrated using forecastability metrics, enhancing user trust.

arXiv:2510.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles. First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their explanations.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models (DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63 compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/DemoDiff.

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts. Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based \textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD} reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD) for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular data.

Summary: The article introduces a method for controlling Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks in deep learning models, which includes tail risks like conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in addition to expected loss. The framework of conformal risk control (CRC) can be applied post-hoc to pre-trained models, but standard CRC may degrade average-case performance. To address this, the authors propose "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach that incorporates risk control into model training or fine-tuning. The method provides provable risk guarantees while improving average-case performance, as demonstrated in applications such as controlling classifiers' false negative rate and financial risk in battery storage operation. <div>
arXiv:2510.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free, finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss (generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling financial risk in battery storage operation.

Summary:  
This new research introduces a framework for detecting memorization in federated learning (FL) that assesses both intra- and inter-client memorization using fine-grained cross-sample measurements. The framework identifies that FL models memorize client data, especially within clients, and that memorization is influenced by training and inferencing factors. Two studies were conducted: one measuring memorization across clients and the other examining key factors affecting memorization, such as decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. The research reveals that FL models exhibit more memorization of intra-client data compared to inter-client data, pointing towards the importance of understanding and mitigating memorization risks in FL systems.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization, including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data, more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and inferencing factors.

Summary:
LOTION is introduced as a method for optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives. It addresses the challenge of zero gradients in quantized loss functions by approximating them with continuous loss surfaces. Inspired by Nesterov smoothing, LOTION incorporates unbiased randomized-rounding noise to smooth the quantized loss, ensuring convergence to local minima. When utilizing noise from stochastic rounding, the global minima of the original quantized loss are preserved. Empirical results show that LOTION outperforms standard Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on various testbeds and large language models with up to 300M parameters. <div>
arXiv:2510.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision \textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language models.

<div> Spatial Deconfounder, causal inference, spatial domains, treatment interference, conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)
Summary:
The Spatial Deconfounder addresses challenges in causal inference in spatial domains by considering unmeasured spatial factors and interference from nearby treatments simultaneously. It utilizes a two-stage method involving a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior to reconstruct a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors and estimate causal effects using a flexible outcome model. This approach allows for nonparametric identification of direct and spillover effects without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the latent field. Empirical results on real-world datasets in environmental health and social science demonstrate that the Spatial Deconfounder significantly improves effect estimation. By leveraging interference to reveal structure in latent confounders, this framework bridges the spatial and deconfounding literatures to enhance robust causal inference in structured data. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1) unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Summary: <br /> Protocol optimization in Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial for balancing diagnostic image quality and radiation dose. Traditional methods are limited by the need for exhaustive parameter testing. This study introduces a novel approach using virtual imaging tools and reinforcement learning to efficiently optimize CT protocols. Human models with liver lesions were used in simulations and reconstructed using a new CT reconstruction toolkit. Parameters included tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent was trained to maximize the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in reconstructed images. The reinforcement learning approach outperformed an exhaustive search, achieving global maximum d' with 79.7% less computational steps. This flexible framework shows promise for improving CT protocol management through the integration of virtual imaging tools and reinforcement learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters, traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images. Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots, tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation. The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space, requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore, on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and generalization of RL policies.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating structural relations directly into Large Language Models' internal encoding process. Two primary in-process methods, sequential concatenation, and parallel caching, are investigated and compared through various tasks. The study demonstrates that the structure-aware approaches consistently outperform text-only and post-hoc baselines across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks. The analysis highlights critical trade-offs between sequential concatenation and parallel caching based on context length and noise levels.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text, overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations, that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle sparse-reward environments. The framework leverages LLMs' procedural knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide action recommendations to RL agents through augmented observation spaces. Unlike existing approaches, this method allows RL agents flexibility in following or ignoring the LLM guidance. The approach was tested on three BabyAI environments, showing significant improvements in success rates, particularly in more challenging tasks. The method also demonstrated substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance thresholds faster. Importantly, this approach does not require any modifications to existing RL algorithms, making it a versatile and effective method for accelerating RL training in challenging environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Summary: <br />
Neural network-based function approximation is crucial for scientific computing and machine learning advancement but faces challenges such as training from scratch for each target function, sensitivity to architectural and hyperparameter choices, and poor generalization. To address these issues, a reusable initialization framework based on basis function pretraining is proposed. Basis neural networks are trained to approximate polynomials on a reference domain, and their parameters initialize networks for complex target functions. A domain mapping mechanism transforms inputs into the reference domain for adaptability across arbitrary domains. Numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings show improved training efficiency, generalization, and model transferability. This approach demonstrates the potential of initialization-based strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full code is available on Gitee. <div>

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization, and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Summary:
- The study focuses on a multi-armed bandit problem where an observer expects an agent to use Thompson Sampling based on public rewards, while a deceptive agent aims to identify the best private arm quickly.
- Detectability is defined as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint between the agent's actual pull probabilities and the observer's anticipated pull probabilities.
- Successful pulling of public suboptimal arms follows a Bernoulli process with decreasing success probability after each successful pull.
- A maximin problem based on public and private means is formulated to determine the optimal error exponent for identifying the best private arm.
- An algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms is proposed, adapting exploration based on the difficulty of pulling arms determined by public suboptimality gaps.<br /><br />Summary: Thompson Sampling is explored in a setting where a deceptive agent aims to identify the best private arm while fooling an observer. The study establishes detectability constraints, analyzes the pulling rate of suboptimal arms, formulates a maximin problem for error exponent determination, and proposes an adaptive algorithm for exploration based on public suboptimality gaps. <div>
arXiv:2510.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards. The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters, initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers' equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Summary: 
The article discusses AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE) in post-quantum cryptography, demonstrating that these attacks can surpass classical methods in certain scenarios. However, a lack of accessible data hinders AI practitioners from studying and enhancing these attacks. To address this issue and expedite AI research on LWE attacks, the TAPAS datasets are introduced. These datasets serve as a Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems, offering various LWE settings for AI model training. By providing pre-generated data, the TAPAS datasets enable AI practitioners to develop new strategies for cracking LWE without the need for extensive time, resources, or expertise. The article not only outlines the creation process of the TAPAS datasets but also establishes baseline performance metrics for LWE attacks, while also proposing future research directions. <div>

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach, a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out directions for future work.

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion, curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities. Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in real-time learning systems

arXiv:2510.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number. Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via extensive experiments.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning framework for reliable 3D reconstruction in edge-native environments. Utilizes cooperative Q-learning agents for camera and server selection. Operates online, learning policies through interactions with the environment. Implements distributed testbed to emulate smart city edge infrastructure. Improves application reliability by balancing latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. <div>
arXiv:2510.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Summary:
FairTTE is introduced as the first framework for evaluating fairness in time-to-event prediction in medical imaging, addressing a gap in existing literature that focuses primarily on image diagnosis tasks. The framework integrates advanced prediction and fairness algorithms to systematically analyze biases in medical image prognosis. Through causal analysis techniques, FairTTE identifies and quantifies sources of bias in imaging datasets, demonstrating pervasive bias across different modalities. Current fairness methods are found to have limited effectiveness in mitigating bias, highlighting the need for holistic solutions targeting all forms of bias. The study also highlights the challenges of maintaining fairness under distribution shifts, emphasizing the importance of developing more robust and equitable prognostic models. The research underscores the pressing need for comprehensive approaches to address bias in medical image prognosis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.

The analysis provides guarantees on alignment metrics such as CKC and RSA, indicating that alignment improves with more classes and higher temperatures. However, parameter-space coupling between CL and NSCL models can diverge exponentially with training time. Empirical validation confirms that alignment strengthens with scale and temperature and that NSCL tracks CL more closely than other supervised objectives, suggesting NSCL as a bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning methodologies. These findings shed light on the alignment of representation between CL and NSCL models, offering insights into the training dynamics of self-supervised learning approaches. <div>

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning.

<div> Sparse Autoencoders, Internal Representations, Large Language Models, Interpretability, Adaptive Temporal Masking <br />
<br />Summary: 
Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for their reliability and safety. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are used for interpretability but face feature absorption issues. A novel training approach called Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM) is introduced to address this. ATM dynamically adjusts feature selection based on activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions, leading to evolving importance scores. By applying probabilistic masking through statistical thresholding of these scores, ATM creates a more natural feature selection process. Experimental results on the Gemma-2-2b model show that ATM significantly reduces absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs while maintaining high reconstruction quality. This establishes ATM as a principled solution for learning stable and interpretable features in neural networks, enhancing model analysis reliability. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

<div> Sparse decomposition, visual streams, deep neural networks, Sparse Component Alignment, representational alignment 

Summary: 
The study explores the visual processing pathways in the human brain and the computational principles underlying them. Using a novel sparse decomposition approach, distinct response profiles for different visual categories are identified within the ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams. A new method, Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), is introduced to measure representational alignment between human brains and deep neural networks. SCA reveals that standard visual DNNs align more closely with ventral stream representations than dorsal or lateral ones. This method offers greater resolution in capturing the underlying neural tuning of the visual systems. The findings shed light on the common and distinct computational principles across the different visual processing pathways in the human brain and deep neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of neural tuning.

The study focuses on efficient allocation of simulation budget using a Gaussian Process (GP) model in binary simulation output scenarios. A new batch active learning algorithm called Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI) is introduced for multi-fidelity GP classifiers, addressing the intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by utilizing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Summary:  
Dig-DEC is introduced as a model-free decision-making approach that focuses on information gain rather than optimism, making it applicable to adversarial environments without the need for explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback, the first model-free regret bounds for such scenarios are obtained, resolving a key open problem. Improved online function-estimation procedures are also presented: for average estimation error minimization, the estimator refinement results in sharper concentration and enhanced regret bounds. In Bellman-complete MDPs, the redesigned two-timescale procedure improves the regret bound significantly, matching the performance of optimism-based approaches. Juxtaposed with previous work, these advancements contribute to a more robust understanding of decision making with structured observation.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work (Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$ (off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from $T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

Summary: 
The article introduces Attribution-based Contribution to Policy Optimization (ACPO) as a framework to enhance Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in large language models (LLMs). ACPO addresses the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation by incorporating a difficulty-aware curriculum. It improves exploration through trajectory semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to regulate policy entropy dynamically. This helps prevent premature entropy collapse and enhance model performance. Additionally, ACPO enhances exploitation by implementing a factorized reward system that accurately assigns credit to reasoning steps. Experimental results on various benchmarks showcase that ACPO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods significantly. <div>

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME, MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<div> frequency-domain analysis, stochastic multi-armed bandit, exploration, exploitation, adaptive filter

Summary:
This paper presents a novel frequency-domain analysis framework for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, reimagining the bandit process as a signal processing problem. The reward estimates of arms are treated as spectral components, with uncertainties represented by frequencies. The bandit algorithm is viewed as an adaptive filter within this framework. The main theorem establishes the equivalence of the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components. Dynamic bounds on the exploration rate decay are derived based on this theory. This analysis offers a fresh interpretation of classical algorithms while providing a rigorous foundation for the development of future algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustments. <div>
arXiv:2510.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.

Summary: <br />
This letter addresses the issue of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration in Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to packet collisions and channel uncertainties. It proposes an optimization approach using Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The model considers vehicle speed, density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) to calculate AoI and implements a dual-path optimization scheme. The LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations, reducing AoI with minimal training. The DDPG method achieves stable performance after training, improving overall system efficiency. Experimental results show the effectiveness of LLM in reducing AoI with few exemplars and the stability of DDPG post-training, demonstrating the potential of this approach for managing AoI in IoV systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training, whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Summary:
Small Earth data, which have limited short-term monitoring variability and spatiotemporal correlations, are important for understanding geoscientific processes. Conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting require task-specific training, while foundation models often exhibit forecasting bias towards the global mean. A new approach proposed in this study aims to accurately forecast small Earth data by characterizing spatiotemporal patterns and using tabular foundation models. Results across different scenarios show that this approach outperforms existing graph deep learning models (T-GCN) and tabular foundation models (TabPFN) in accuracy and robustness. This approach provides a simple and robust solution for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting, with implications for improving our understanding of geoscientific processes.

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale. However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting. The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger robustness.

Adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs) introduce a dynamic approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs, adapting subdomains to the solution's intrinsic features. Inspired by mesh refinement techniques, the domain decomposition is modified during training by adding new subdomains in high-residual loss regions for better representation of the challenging differential equation solution. AB-PINNs are effective for multiscale problems, capturing various solution scales in different subdomains.

Numerical results demonstrate AB-PINNs' effectiveness in solving complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution. Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Summary:
The article introduces a Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT) that encompasses a method to quantify confidence in feature combinations using hierarchical probabilistic hashing. By leveraging confidence scores, MATT generates multiple inference paths based on sampling probabilities, aiming to mitigate low-confidence features' influence on final predictions. These paths are created through iterative sampling and prediction score aggregation. The proposed approach addresses the underexplored optimization opportunities during the inference phase in Click-Through Rate (CTR) models, particularly focusing on infrequently occurring feature combinations that can impact prediction reliability. Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the efficacy and compatibility of MATT with existing CTR models, showcasing improved predictive performance by guiding prediction generation through multiple inference paths. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths, thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations, we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework designed to enhance the calibration and generalization of deep learning models in high-risk decision-making tasks. Traditional methods rely on static hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability to changing data distributions.

The learnable Dirichlet prior allows for flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that MPC significantly improves uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection, making it a valuable tool for improving the reliability of model predictions in various tasks.  <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts, and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring, experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static, dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Summary: <br />
Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) combine structural connections with semantics for data-centric applications. GNNs' performance on TAGs is affected by input quality. Traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs face challenges in scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance due to limited graph quality. LAGA, a multi-agent framework, treats graph quality as a primary concern. LAGA integrates detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents for automated quality enhancement through a dual-encoder and tri-objective design. Experimental results show LAGA's effectiveness in improving graph quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and validating data-centric optimization for reliable TAGs and robust graph learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer, reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture search materials science and beyond.

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization. Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers. Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties, \textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss regularization.

<title>Diagnosing and Mitigating System Bias in Self-Rewarding RL</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias: the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses, with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$, $\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that $\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while $\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

<title>FedL2T: Personalized Federated Learning with Two-Teacher Distillation for Seizure Prediction</title>

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client. Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition, a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints, especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions, improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations, enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and (iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code and tutorials are available at github.com/amai-gsu/PlatformX.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet, BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance drops.

<title>LLM Unlearning on Noisy Forget Sets: A Study of Incomplete, Rewritten, and Watermarked Data</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean, well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets. By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow lexical patterns.

<title>Value-State Gated Attention for Mitigating Extreme-Token Phenomena in Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static, end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio, and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline, Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A 96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo}, \textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1) We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\% over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design, respectively.

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware, algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of resource-intensive training.

<title>The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections</title>

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption. From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions, without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on feed-forward neural networks.

<title>Robust Driving Control for Autonomous Vehicles: An Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection (CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a 10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders. Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms (CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals. Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from 60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$ GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,' to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness. Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

<title>On the Fairness of Privacy Protection: Measuring and Mitigating the Disparity of Group Privacy Risks for Differentially Private Machine Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.

<title>Regret Bounds for Adversarial Contextual Bandits with General Function Approximation and Delayed Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} + \sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a (possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$. In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of $O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$ is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter $\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we also present.

arXiv:2510.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score. We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of pairwise comparisons.

<title>Logits Replay + MoClip: Stabilized, Low-Cost Post-Training with Minimal Forgetting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training: improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation. However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level. In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over 40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

arXiv:2510.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static, pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments. We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

arXiv:2510.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs. This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping) and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and data regime.

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy. However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla training.

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by the original authors.

arXiv:2510.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this, we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint (signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels (sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on https://github.com/lzhan94swu/GCM.

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

arXiv:2510.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge. Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment. Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

arXiv:2510.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is, such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction feasibility.

arXiv:2510.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios. Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift, where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan - where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness, we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error) of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through error control mechanisms.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$ matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally, we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

<title>Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers</title>

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence. Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

<title>Deep Learning to Identify the Spatio-Temporal Cascading Effects of Train Delays in a High-Density Network</title>

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays. Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

<title>The Potential of Second-Order Optimization for LLMs: A Study with Full Gauss-Newton</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure. This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements. Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the capabilities of sequence models.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples, facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE (Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty, under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates, thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.

arXiv:2510.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation, geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

<title>Cross-Receiver Generalization for RF Fingerprint Identification via Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver, as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory. Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple, practical recipes for robust training.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on \emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

<title>Cross-attention Secretly Performs Orthogonal Alignment in Recommendation Models</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300 experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter. We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in multi-modal research.

arXiv:2510.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches. Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures. Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance.

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space. Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds. The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass, achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model. We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details, the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional weather forecasting

<title>Locally Optimal Private Sampling: Beyond the Global Minimax</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in $f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class $\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this, we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$. Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of $f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the sample efficiency of existing methods.
